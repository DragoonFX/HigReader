[Himatsubushi Ch.1]

I had misread the time, and ended up arriving too early.
The schedule board flipped with a series of clacks.
My flight to Sapporo was still a bit later on.
I still had over an hour before boarding.
...Well, I might as well close my eyes for a bit on that bench over there, then.
I came here directly from work, so maybe the fatigue from that was making me sleepy.
Finding a suitable bench, I put my luggage on the seat next to me and settled down.

<Akasaka>
"...Phew..."
I sighed like an old man.
I had hoped to stay young forever, but had become splendidly middle-aged.
...Apparently the rumor that "even people in the latter half of their twenties experience a decline in their physical strength" wasn't a lie.
It had been mind-numbingly busy at work lately, so I rarely had any time to myself.
This might have been the first time I'd been able to enjoy a journey alone like this since I was a student.
...The reason behind this trip was to meet with an old friend.
It was a bit strange to call him an old friend...
 in fact, it might be better to call him a bad one.
After retiring a couple of years ago, he moved to Sapporo, his mother's hometown.
His mother passed away soon after, and he was now peacefully enjoying his second lease on life.
His name was Kuraudo Ooishi.
He was a former detective from the Primary Investigation Unit at the station in Okinomiya, XX Prefecture.
To be honest, the only direct contact we ever had didn't last more than three days.
After that, we exchanged New Year's cards, but never met again.
So, this would be the first time meeting him in... seven years.
In other words, we met seven years ago.
In 1978.
There was something I just had to ask-- to talk to him about concerning that time.
To explain that... it was impossible not to recall the incident that happened back then.
...That kidnapping, the details and resolution of which were resigned to darkness.
Also... it was impossible not to recall a certain mysterious girl.
...
My name is Mamoru Akasaka.
It was a year that had been strangely hot even though it was only June...

<Everyone>
"""Goodbye, teacher!!"""

<Teacher>
"Okay, bye.
 Watch out for cars.
 And don't drop in at a friend's house along the way.

<Teacher>
Make sure you get your textbooks in order for tomorrow before you go to bed."
Clatter clatter clatter!
The lively sounds of children running towards the hallway.

<Young boy>
"Hey now, didn't I tell you before!?"

<Young boy>
"I already have one of those!!
 I don't need any more!!"
The unique high-pitched voice of youth.
The energetic shrill of the cicadas went completely unheard by their ears.
Children, returning home from school, split off one-by-one from their groups of friends as they went through intersections in the residential area.
Even though there were several of them in a group as they left the school, as they got closer to their homes, their numbers dwindled.
...That's why the fewer friends you were walking home with acted as an indicator that you were that much closer to your destination.

<Young boy>
"Later!!
 See ya!"

<Young boy>
"Yeah, see you tomorrow."
He finally parted ways with his last friend.
...A van was parked at a bend in the road.
The window was open, the sound of the radio leaking outside.
 ...It must have been the news or something.

<Radio>
"...for that reason, the three of them were arrested for traffic violations and obstruction of justice. 

<Radio>
Due to the protests against the Hinamizawa Dam Project resulting in bloodshed when clashing with riot police last month, things have only become more violent. 

<Radio>
The police are therefore taking precautions against radical activists causing yet another incident. 

<Radio>
Last week, there was also a direct confrontation with Minister Inukai on the steps of the Ministry of Construction..."
The boy's ears perked up at the mention of the name "Inukai".
At that moment, a man's face peeked out suddenly from the window of the van.
His behavior was a little different than that of a man looking around to see if there was any incoming traffic before he opened the door of his vehicle.
...His eyes meeting suddenly with the unfamiliar man, the boy panicked slightly...

<Nightingale>
"...Nightingale, okay."

<Skylark>
"Skylark, okay.
 They've secured the two blocks around us.
 ...We're good to go!"
The man in the passenger seat whispered quietly.
Nodding in acknowledgement, the man opened the door... and stood before the boy.

<Nightingale>
"...You.
 ...Are you Toshiki Inukai-kun?"
While asking that, the man peered at the boy's nametag.
..."Toshiki Inukai"...
 the name was written plainly there...
The phone rang for a third time.
If he reached out, he could easily pick up the receiver.
...However, he was concerned that if he picked it up before it had even finished ringing once, whoever was on the other end of the line would think him a fairly cheap person.
That's why he normally never picked up the phone until the third ring.
Even he thought it was a worthless habit.
...However, his thinking that "there isn't much meaning in waiting for just three rings, wouldn't waiting for five be all right?" was very much a reality.
His mind filled with such trifling thoughts, he picked up the phone after the third ring had finished, its reverb dampened by his action...

<Inukai>
"...Yes.
 ...Hello...?"
"..."

<Inukai>
"......Hello?"
"..."
He knew that sometimes due to a malfunction at the switchboard, calls didn't connect well.
At those times, it was best to hang up and let the person on the other end call again.
...Thinking that, the moment he began to hang up the phone...
 ...He sensed that he was definitely connected after all. He felt the presence of the person on the other end of the line, keeping silent...

<Inukai>
"......Hello...?"
"..."
There was no way they didn't hear his question.
 ...What was the meaning of this?
It wasn't like he didn't know that people could use silent calls to harass others.
However, he'd never received a call like that until today.
...Maybe he was just lucky before, but he didn't believe that he would receive such a call on this phone.
There were no direct calls to or from this line.
Everything had to go through an operator.
Therefore, there was absolutely no way the call would be connected unless it was verified there was somebody else on the other end of the line.
That's why he didn't understand how to deal with this silent call, and instead settled into confusion...

<Inukai>
"...I don't know who you are, but if you have nothing to say I'm going to hang up.
 Please call again some other time."
Intending that to be a parting line, he made to slam down the receiver.
...It was at that moment, the person on the other end spoke for the first time.

<Kidnapper>
"...You didn't say who you were, so I was anxious.
 If you're not Minister Inukai, please hang up right away."
He couldn't help but be surprised by the extremely strange voice on the other end of the line.
...Was there a human alive who could speak with this hoarse and metallic voice?
... No. ...This was... a voice he had heard somewhere before.
That was the kind of voice that was on those lowbrow documentaries, that they'd use when they wanted to hide the identity of a speaker, wasn't it?
...The voice he was hearing over the line was exactly like that.

<Inukai>
"... Who... are you?"

<Kidnapper>
"....As I said, that's what I want to ask.
 Are you Minister Inukai?"
He --Inukai-- hesitated to answer.
Unable to discern the intent of this suspicious phone call, he had a vague feeling that something was off.
He thought about hanging up the phone and asking the operator who initiated the call.
...However, he forced himself to restrain that urge, and for the time being, chose to state his name and listen.

<Inukai>
"...That's right.
 This is Inukai.
 ...I said my name, now you say yours."

<Kidnapper>
"...My name doesn't matter.
 First of all, let's begin by thinking about the situation you're in right now. 

<Kidnapper>
...Right now, you're sitting in your chair talking on the phone, yes?
 Then, why don't you try opening the lower drawer to your right."
The lowest drawer to the right of the minister's chair.
...There was a lock on it. Not enough to function as a safe, but nevertheless it was a drawer that contained some valuable things.
That's why Inukai thought that the person wanted some of the important information contained within that drawer.

<Inukai>
"...Sorry, but I don't have any intention of opening that.
 I have no reason to follow orders from somebody who won't even give me his name."

<Kidnapper>
"If you don't open that drawer, I'll hang up the phone.
 ...You will most likely end up regretting that.
 Why don't you think about opening that drawer first?"
Inukai didn't like following orders from this suspicious person one bit.
...However, he was concerned about what the man said about "regretting it," so he decided to open the drawer.
He took the small key he kept stowed in his wallet, and unlocked the drawer.
...His hand stopped right before he opened it.
What if there was a bomb inside... and it would explode if the drawer was opened...?
That delusion took hold of him.
He quelled that instinct, and opened it.

<Kidnapper>
"...Did you do it?
 The thing that's in there, do you know what it is?"

<Inukai>
"
...
This is...
 What is the meaning of this!?
 Hey!!"

<Kidnapper>
"I don't think there's any need for me to explain, is there?
 I'll give you some time, so please think about it a little.
 I'll contact you again later.
 Now then, pardon me..."

<Inukai>
"Hey!
 Wait!!
 Hello!?
 HELLO!?!?"
The call had already ended.
That would not change no matter how much he yelled at it.
...Even still, Inukai, without realizing that, continued yelling into the receiver for a while.
...The drawer was still open.
...On top of the folders crammed into the drawer, it lay there.
"Toshiki Inukai"
Written in plain lettering on a grade-schooler's nametag... just lying there.
Enshrined there, completely out of place, as if it were cowering...
...Do you remember, Yukie?
 This picture.
This is where I first proposed to you.
...That brief moment before you nodded back,
 you probably wouldn't know
 just how much
 it seemed like
 an eternity to me.
Yes.
 I would have never thought that amount of time could feel like an eternity.
Compared to how long I had to wait for you to propose to me, it was...
Hahahahahaha...
From the moment I met you until today...
...Compared to the time I've spent since I was born, it might only be a brief period, but...
They were definitely precious, beautiful days that deserved to be called an eternity.
...That time continues even now.
...From now on.
I wonder if it'll be a boy...
 or maybe a girl?
...Either one is fine.
Boy or girl... either way it's living proof that we love each other.
If it's a boy, we'll name it after you: "Mamoru."
If it's a girl, we'll put the "Yuki" from my name in hers...
Thinking about names is so fun that in the end we still haven't decided yet.
There's still time to puzzle over it.
 ...Not that long of a time, actually.
....You see, Yukie.
 ...There's something I have to apologize for today.
...It's about your job.
...Sorry.
...It looks like an annoying bit of work has come up.
 ...In the worst case,
 ...I might not be able to be there for the delivery.
It's fine.
You have a very important job.
What you do protects the way we live.
....Compared to you, it's nothing.
Please, go ahead.
When you return, I'll be waiting here with our child.
Thank you.
 ...Also,
 I'm sorry.
...Please don't apologize.
If you feel guilty about it... then you can just atone.
If I atone that much, no matter how much money I have, it won't be enough.
Hee hee.
 It's a joke.
...Now ...Go on..
As I left the room, I bumped into an elderly man.
...It was Yukie's father.
 ...In other words, my father-in-law.

<Akasaka>
"...Father."

<Father-in-law>
"I didn't want to intrude.
 So I waited in the hall."

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Father-in-law>
"I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I heard.
 ...Go.
 Yukie is that kind of girl.
 ...No matter what happens, she doesn't want to hold you back."

<Akasaka>
"...I've... forced Yukie to give up on so many things.
 To put her through this during childbirth, such an important time in her life... I'm ashamed."

<Father-in-law>
"...If you really feel that way, ...When you're done with your work, make some time for Yukie.
 ...She'll be happier with that than you passing your work off on someone else."

<Akasaka>
"...Thank you."

<Father-in-law>
"I know full well you do important work.
 Be proud in what you do.
 Yukie is looking forward to your triumphant return..."

<Akasaka>
"...Yes."
I jumped into the taxi that was waiting outside.
Compared to the time when I first got here, the numbers on the fare meter had grown considerably.
...It seemed the modest time Yukie and I had spent together wasn't so modest from an objective point of view.

<Akasaka>
"Sorry to keep you waiting.
 Go ahead."

<Driver>
"...No worries.
 Well then, off we go."
The taxi jerked as it changed gears to accelerate, soon burying the hospital my wife was in behind a throng of buildings.
...If it was to end up as a really troublesome ordeal... I probably wouldn't be returning for quite some time.
To call a rookie like me, and on top of that, one who's off duty... It seemed that the section chief was calling for all hands on deck.
The veteran upper brass gathering on an emergency basis happened occasionally...
This was the first time, though, that I experienced everybody gathering together like this.
Whatever was happening, there was no doubt it was going to be something novel.
...Right when my wife was ready to give birth.
 ...If I wanted to spend the time to curse my misfortunes, I'd be here all day.
Even the verdant gingko trees lining the street that always brightened my mood seemed to lack some of their usual lustre...
Eventually, the government office came into view.
Briefly holding my breath... I let the feelings of tension course through my body once again.
...I had to remember the work I was doing was important, necessary... and difficult.
I composed myself and sharpened my wit.
...Ready.
The taxi stopped in front of the building.

<Kanou>
"Chief, everyone's here.
 Akasaka-kun, could you close the blinds?"
The blinds were usually closed when they needed to use the projector, or if the discussion was going to contain some particularly disturbing content.
The blinds closed with a satisfying sound, darkening the interior of the room.
...Immediately, the inside of the room was completely drained of the pleasant morning atmosphere, leaving behind only the cold illumination of the fluorescent lighting.
After the supervisor ensured that everyone was present, he nodded to the section chief once again.
...With everybody on the edge of their seats, the chief stood up solemnly, and began to give his report.

<Chief>
"Approximately 48 hours ago, the Minister of Construction's grandson, who is also the son of one of his staff leaders, is believed to have been kidnapped. 

<Chief>
It is believed the Minister, in an effort to resolve matters amicably, chose not to report the situation to the police and plans to cede to the demands imposed upon him."
It seemed that approximately 48 hours earlier, the Minister of Construction's grandson, who was also the son of one of his senior staff members, was kidnapped.
The reason why it was phrased that way was because the person in question didn't admit it had happened.

<Chief>
"Based on the results of surveillance conducted on the Minister's residence, multiple suspicious phone calls from what is believed to be outside the city took place.

<Chief>
The abducted child is said to be under treatment for some illness, but there's no trace of any hospital records or witnesses to such effect. 

<Chief>
Due to that and various other reasons, we believe without a doubt that a kidnapping has occurred."
...Here, they omitted the details that brought this incident to light.
If you think about it a bit, that meant that before this incident happened,
 the Minister's residence had been under surveillance already (I won't use the words "spied upon").
Of course, there wouldn't have been court approval for this, and it would have been very hard to explain to ordinary citizens...
However, it was quite an effective method to catch wind of incidents like this before they got worse.
I'd like for you to understand that dealing with these cases before they become a problem is the job of the Public Safety Division.

<Man>
"Why is he just following their demands instead of reporting this to the police?"

<Man>
"The fact that a Minister can't even trust the police, what is the world coming to?"

<Chief>
"It seems the group of perpetrators demonstrated that they have quite a high level of surveillance on the Minister themselves when they conducted the kidnappings. 

<Chief>
Enough to give the Minister pause before calling the police."

<Man>
"'We'll find out right away if you call the cops,' more or less?"

<Man>
"So it's possible that there's a mole close to the Minister."
Several of the higher ranking members who seemed to have experience with this kind of thing let out deep sighs...

<Chief>
"The goals of the perpetrators, their demands, as well as this entire incident are as of yet unclear,
 but in any case, the possibility that this may grow to threaten national interest is extremely high."
If their goal was to simply have their demands met for monetary gain, that would have been nice.
...However, if this was some politically-motivated shake-up, things would get a lot more complicated.

<Man>
"Since we're not receiving any cooperation from the victim, that means that we're not privy to any of the details of the threats or demands..."

<Chief>
"Due to the fact we believe there may be a mole involved in this incident, this investigation is highly classified; only the people in this room are to know of this. 

<Chief>
Furthermore, as this case is our utmost priority, we'll be placing a hold on everybody's normal duties.
 Understood!?"
After that, the supervisor continued on, tactfully explaining our course of action.
If this incident were to become public, it was possible that the Minister's political life would be over.
...I'll spare you the explanation of how the rest of the dominoes would fall, but in the end, support in the Diet would decline,
 followed by a no-confidence vote and a snap election,
 and it might even expand communist influences.
...In other words, we wanted to handle this delicately.

<Chief>
"Kawasaki and Saeki, monitor communications from the Minister and the child's residences 24/7.
 Find out what the Minister is doing.
 Report anything that happens. 

<Chief>
The remaining members, investigate whatever is related to the case as assigned to your units.
 Focus your line of investigation on recently active subversives. 

<Chief>
dialog000Don't discount the possibility of foreign involvement, either!"
I've experienced one or two... unamicable situations before.
 This, however, was the first time I've seen things get so hectic.
Several sophisticated conversations were progressing without the involvement of a rookie like me.
...I didn't intend to be timid, but I couldn't hide my confusion at this unfamiliar situation.

<Kanou>
"--and cover Kakiuchi.
dialog001 As for Akasaka-kun,"
I snapped back to alertness upon hearing my name called.

<Akasaka>
"Y-Yes!"

<Kanou>
"You investigate the environmental groups that have petitioned the minister.
 Among them, there's that group protesting the Hinamizawa Dam Project that made the papers. Make sure you investigate them thoroughly. 

<Kanou>
I doubt this is the act of some citizen group, but we have to eliminate every possibility we can."

<Akasaka>
"Understood.
 So those opposed to the Hinamizawa Dam..."

<Kanou>
"It's probably best if you go to the location personally.
 Get some information from the local authorities. 

<Kanou>
They're a fairly radical organization, so the Public Safety Division there should have them marked as well."

<Akasaka>
"Understood.
 I'll head over there."

<Kanou>
"...Your wife, she's almost ready to give birth, isn't she?
 I apologize for the timing of all this, but I'm counting on your cooperation. 

<Kanou>
We can't take our time with this, so we just have to brute-force it with our boots to the ground."

<Akasaka>
"Yeah, I know.
 ...My wife hates to interfere with my work with her own circumstances anyways."

<Kanou>
"Sorry, and thanks.
 ...So then, as for Kawasaki-kun and Saeki-kun, to help support your..."
...I didn't want to take a business trip when my wife was about to give birth.
Even if I was a little busy, as long as I was in Tokyo, I could head to the hospital right away.
 ...On assignment, though... that would be difficult.
Even so, I knew the work I was doing was important, and fully understood that I was in no position to be so selfish.
I'd have to make it up to my wife for having to be away at such an important time.
My wife-- Yukie, would probably forgive me with a smile.
The only thing she could hate doing would be holding me back.
...My male ego, though, at least wished she would have tried to stop me.
Sorry... Yukie.
I don't mind if you always complain to our child that their father couldn't come to the hospital when they were born because he was too busy with work...
...The next day, I took the bullet train to Nagoya, and from there transferred to the train to XX Prefecture.
Getting to my destination by land took several hours.
If I was travelling by air, in that amount of time I could probably get as far as Hong Kong.
 ...XX Prefecture was by no means close.
I never sat in first class except for work, but whenever I did the seats seemed stiff.
Closing my eyes, I mentally reviewed the documents I read yesterday.
The group under investigation: the "Onigafuchi Guardians."
They were a group of residents opposed to the development proposed under the Hinamizawa Dam Project.
The local protests were quite heated, and were getting more radicalized.
Even limited to what was written in the newspapers, there was bloodshed that occurred during a clash with riot police, interference with the dam construction... too many to count.
The number of petitions, sit-ins, and direct appeals to the relevant organizations were innumerable.
...As an extension of that, there was a direct appeal to the Minister of Construction the other day.

<Akasaka>
(This was the reason why we were investigating this group in the first place.)
...The land that they lived on was going to be submerged, so it was no wonder they would go into a frenzy over it.
Even given that, though... could they really be capable of doing something like kidnapping the Minister of Construction's grandson in order to halt the project?
From my take on it, I had serious doubts.
This kidnapping plot was extremely sophisticated, and complicated enough that it was believed there was some political backing.
...This wasn't something that could be pulled off by some group of local protesters.
...Well, just like the chief said, the plan was to eliminate all possibilities.
While I'm in the XX police's reference room taking my time investigating, the higher-ups in Tokyo would probably solve the case.
Without my involvement entirely.
...Even if that was true, I couldn't regret being away from Tokyo while my wife was ready to give birth.
This was work.
 ...There was really nothing that I could do.
Ding dong.
The announcement that we would be arriving at our destination soon snapped me back to wakefulness.

<Akasaka>
"The Onigafuchi Guardians?"

<Chief>
"Yeah, they've been quite active around here."
The Prefectural Public Safety Department already had the documents and a cup of tea ready and waiting for me.

<Chief>
"The short of it is they're a group of residents opposed to the dam.
 Really, it's probably better to say that every resident living on the land that's going to be submerged is rising to action, though.

<Chief>
Like the old saying 'fight to the last,' they're a determined and well-prepared lot.
 It'd be nice if they drew the line at just being a moderate residential organization."
The stack of papers they had prepared for me in the document room was by no means thin.

<Chief>
"At first, they were pretty much your average citizen's initiative, but
 ever since that incident with the riot police they've really started to heat up. 

<Chief>
Now they've got a violent mentality, on top of growing increasingly radical."
Violent organizations usually indicate ones that enforce their own ideology without regards to the democratic process.
Breaking that down, many of those organizations held extreme-left revolutionary ideologies.
...Considering that, I couldn't help but be surprised that a citizen's group would end up going this far...
Radical citizen's movements happen occasionally.
It seemed, however, that this group... was nothing as trifling as that.
...It seemed that I would have to reconsider exactly what this Onigafuchi Guardians was.

<Akasaka>
"...The Guardians's demand, in other words, the withdrawal of the dam project... how far would they go to have that demand met?"
The kidnapping of the Minister's grandson was classified.
...That meant of course, I couldn't tell the XX Prefectural Department about it either.

<Chief>
"As you know, there were arrests after last week's confrontation with Minister Inukai.
 They're certainly dangerous enough."
...So they could be expected to use any means necessary to force their demands.
dialog002I skimmed over the list of the criminal records related to the Onigafuchi Guardians recorded in the documents.
...The contents were all violent, not giving me the barest hint of a feeling that these people were trying to uphold the law.

<Akasaka>
"Could you give me any specifics?"
dialog003The chief opened up a manila envelope, fished out several unorganized sheets and spread them out on the desk.

<Chief>
"It seems that raids on the construction site are the most common.
 At first, they were committing relatively petty crimes like cutting power cords, jamming locks, and breaking office windows by throwing rocks."
Of course, what really happened first were things like demonstrations, sit-ins, and distribution of pamphlets; lively but democratic forms of protests.
However, then the demonstrators and police clashed, which started a riot, leading to numerous injuries and arrests. It was from then on that the Onigafuchi Guardians, like their name implies, began to take a more demonic form of resistance...

<Akasaka>
"If the raids were frequent, didn't the local police up their patrols?"

<Chief>
"Well of course they were on full alert, but
 they were up against locals, you know?
 There wasn't much the police could do if they were sneaking around under the cover of darkness."
You might as well label the entire map of Hinamizawa Village around the dam construction site 'enemy territory.'
No matter how alert the police were... the locals would just show them exactly how easy it was to sneak around.

<Chief>
"Actually, it was after the police upped security that the protestors started getting ever more extreme, as though they were being provoked.
 ...See here? Can you tell how things started to heat up?"

<Akasaka>
"...An office set on fire.
 ...The destruction of heavy construction equipment.
 ...Destruction?
 They couldn't have used explosives?"

<Chief>
"No way.
 You see, they crammed the gas tanks full of sugar cubes.
 If they do that, it fouls the engines."
Even in Japan, it seemed there had been people doing that to the vehicles of occupying forces right after the war.
...Compared to misdemeanors like breaking windows, it was extremely violent and aggressive.

<Akasaka>
"...After being toyed around with to that extent, the local police have completely lost face."

<Chief>
"The arson was a bit much.
 After that, the local police drastically increased the number of personnel they had stationed there around the clock.
 The raids on the construction site quieted down a bit after that."
He used the words "quieted down"... but that was still smack dab in the middle of the list of crimes.

<Chief>
"See, after that, they....
 After they found that attacking the site had become difficult, they started resorting to personal attacks.
 ...The first people targeted were the construction workers."
After that, there was silence.
What was being described to me was a guerilla war fought in the jungle...
Threats and violence against the workers.
 Harsh words and harsher rocks were thrown.

<Akasaka>
"...There's quite a list of accusations here, but there's not a whole lot of convictions."

<Chief>
"Of course not.
 First of all, there's no witnesses.
 On top of that, even if we identify the perpetrators, they have alibis coming out of the woodwork."

<Akasaka>
"...?
 What do you mean by that?"

<Chief>
"Hmmm.
 ...Take for example,
 you're walking around Hinamizawa,
 when a certain man stabs you with a knife.
 You remember the person clearly, and even know his name and address. 

<Chief>
However, the knife doesn't have any fingerprints on it, and there's no other physical evidence.
 ...Well, you'd think this would be a run-of-the-mill case of assault, wouldn't you? 

<Chief>
In Hinamizawa, though, it's a perfect crime."
Everybody is... the entire village, they're all in on it.
To protect the man who was the perpetrator, they'll get their stories straight and prepare an alibi.
...To that end, they'll probably even forge some evidence.

<Chief>
"There's nothing they can do but put them on trial.
 On top of there not being any material evidence, though, people testify one after another to cover his side of the story. 

<Chief>
...Any prosecutor would hesitate to file charges. 

<Chief>
I'm not sure about murder, but if it's something like opening a gash on somebody's forehead with a thrown rock, or leaving a bruise after hitting someone, even if you could single out the suspect, there's enough reasonable doubt to not convict."
Every case is without a doubt perpetrated by someone in Hinamizawa... but they can't identify who.
Even if they could figure out who it is, they're unable to obtain enough circumstantial evidence through due process...
The villagers were all extremely well-informed about this, and so the malicious, vicious... and tenacious personal attacks continued...

<Akasaka>
"The victims can't have been okay with that, right?
 Couldn't they have filed for an appeal?"

<Chief>
"Well you see, about that, everybody on the Inquest Committee didn't want to get involved with something so troublesome.
 They won't stick their noses into anything related to Hinamizawa."
The Inquest Committee is comprised of a random selection of local residents.
...In the event the prosecutor fails to get a conviction, they have the power to order a retrial.
It's a system designed to assert the will of the people on the actions of expert prosecutors in the legal world...
...In this case, however, being composed of local residents has backfired.

<Akasaka>
"They don't want to get involved?
 Why is that?"

<Chief>
"...Hmmm...
 How do I explain this...
 You could say they're afraid...
 ...Since it's a little special there."

<Akasaka>
"...Special?
 Are you suggesting they have some sort of political core?"

<Chief>
dialog004"No... it's a little different from that...
 ...Well... just think of it as them being afraid.
 It's a little hard to explain it just now.
 ....Oh, right. There's an easier way."
Wiping his forehead with a handkerchief, he opened a file labeled as a list of members of the Onigafuchi Guardians.

<Chief>
"The power of the Onigafuchi Guardians, you see...
 Is the fact that they count many people among their members who are influential in neighboring areas.
 Could you take a look at this?"
...I looked. What I saw startled me.
Prefectural and municipal assembly members. Staff members of the Chamber of Commerce. An executive of a business association.
...An executive of a town council association and a PTA liaison... there were more than a few people with a lot of say both locally and in the neighboring regions.

<Chief>
"Around here, you could pretty much expect your actions to be observed by those against the dam project.
 ...If you said something in its support... who knows how it'd work out to your disadvantage. 

<Chief>
In any case, every town in this area is being held by the throat by somebody from Hinamizawa."

<Akasaka>
"The list of Inquisition Committee members is undisclosed, isn't it?
 There has to be some measures in place to make sure they'd avoid retribution, no?"

<Chief>
"...Well, it is undisclosed, so their privacy is assured, but...
 The person in charge of that is from the Okinomiya Municipal Office.
 ...In other words, a local. 

<Chief>
While you might expect some professional confidentiality... you can't know how everybody is connected.
 The people from Hinamizawa have a lot of tight bonds in that regard."
...When you consider the obligations and duties people have to the region, the web of information thereby formed is nothing to scoff at.
It's not uncommon for housewives in a neighborhood to know which kid from which house is what grade in which school, what subjects they're good at and what vegetables they hate, among other things.

<Chief>
"...You see, there's a yakuza organization here with strong ties to Hinamizawa and the surrounding area.
 It would seem that they're providing full support in these recent incidents. 

<Chief>
They seem to be proving most effective."

<Akasaka>
"Gangsters?
 Siding together with the residents opposed to the construction of the dam?
 ...It's a little hard to see what their common interest is."

<Chief>
"It's not that difficult at all.
 You see, actually, one of the lieutenants in that gang is originally from Hinamizawa.
 He was adopted into a rather influential family in the village."
...Exactly what was this Hinamizawa?
I had thought it was some desolate rustic village.
However, for some reason they exerted a strong influence on the surrounding areas, and had a strong sense of unity. 
They would protect their village by any means necessary, even if that meant resorting to violence.
The chief had said that they were afraid because there were numerous influential people living there,
 but somehow, I got the feeling that they were afraid of the village itself.
There was something clearly different from what I had read in the documents in Tokyo. This was no simple residential protest against the dam.
For some reason, an uneasy feeling began to nestle itself at the back of my mind.
I chose the most basic way to ask my question.
...In other words, I directly asked what I wanted to know.

<Akasaka>
"...Chief.
 ...This is just a hypothetical situation, but..."

<Chief>
"Huh?"

<Akasaka>
"This... Onigafuchi Guardians.
 In order to halt the dam project...
 ...Do you think they could, say, threaten somebody important to accomplish that?"
The chief replied immediately.

<Chief>
"It's possible.
 Truth be told, they've already gone to municipal and prefectural offices, as well as local offices of the Ministry of Construction and done things that could be construed as intimidation. 

<Chief>
Several of the worker's families have also reported that they're being followed around by some suspicious people."
...Well, that would make sense.
To halt progress on the dam, they raided the construction site, destroying heavy machinery and lighting the construction office on fire.
If they didn't have any qualms about doing that... threats and violence against people related to the dam would probably be no problem.
...But... that was it.
Even your everyday hoodlum could use threats and violence.
However, this time it was the kidnapping of the Minister's grandson... an abnormally high-level crime.
Not only was pulling off the kidnapping difficult in the first place, but so was maneuvering to have the minister surrender to their demands immediately. There was no way this was the work of amateurs.
...Did these people have the power to enact this large of a crime...?
That was the heart of the matter.
Was the Onigafuchi Guardians an organization capable of pulling this off?
...In order to ask that question, once again...
...I chose the most basic method.

<Akasaka>
"...Again, hypothetically, do you think...
 They could kidnap a relative of someone of political importance?"
There's no way they could pull off something that big.
That was the answer I most hoped for.
If it was that answer... my work was as good as halfway done.
I might be able to get back in time for my wife to give birth.
 ...That was how it was supposed to be.
The chief, without a hint of hesitation, replied:

<Chief>
"They just might.
 There's no telling how far they'd go."
...Sorry, Yukie.
...It seemed like my work wouldn't end so simply after all.

<Chief>
"...Oh, Akasaka-kun.
 Good work.
 How's the information gathering at your assigned region?"

<Akasaka>
dialog005"It's coming along.
 It seems I'll be able to meet with their local Public Safety Department, so I'm planning on heading out that way.
 How's the investigation in Tokyo going?"

<Chief>
"The others are progressing along, but
 the number of groups we have to investigate are countless.
 Time isn't really a luxury here."
...There were no new developments at this time.
No matter how suspicious the Onigafuchi Guardians was, if they solved the case in Tokyo, my job was done.
 ...It looked like my wishful thinking wouldn't come to pass.
Hanging up the phone, I let my gaze drift outside the window to the valley of unfamiliar buildings...

<Chief>
"Akasaka-san.
 A car you can borrow just returned.
 I'll take you to it, so follow me."

<Akasaka>
"Ah, thank you."
He showed me the elevator to the underground parking lot where a battered sedan was waiting for me.
That the steering wheel kept drifting to the left was a little concerning, but it would be enough to get me around for a while.
My destination was Shishibone City, XX Prefecture.
...An area under the control of the Onigafuchi Guardians.
 The Okinomiya Police Station was right on the front lines.
Shishibone City was, as far as provincial cities went, rather behind the times.
Okinomiya, recessed in the mountains, was even more remote.
With little change between the seasons, all that was left was the tepid passage of time... it made for a rather drab town.
There were no tourist attractions or local delicacies.
Without even a strong regional industry, it was simply dull.
Just looking at the monotonous and peaceful townscape, it was hard to catch a glimpse of the radical resistance of the Onigafuchi Guardians...
The atmosphere of boredom didn't hint of the Okinomiya Police Station being on the front lines of the dam conflict, nor of the numerous incidents that I heard about at the prefectural headquarters.

<Office Worker>
"Good morning.
 Are you here to pay a fine?"

<Akasaka>
"No, I have an appointment with Hondaya-san from the Public Safety Division.
 Please tell him it's Akasaka."

<Office Worker>
"Ah...
 m-my apologies. Please wait a minute..."
The clerk (who thought that I was here for a parking violation at first glance) after fumbling with the unfamiliar extension number, told the person on the line they had a visitor.

<Hondaya>
"Welcome, welcome!
 Akasaka-san, was it? It must have been tiring travelling out all this way!
 Sorry we have to do this here. I tried to reserve a reception room, you see, 

<Hondaya>
but the councillor suddenly woke up and chased me out!
 Wahahaha!"
I would hesitate to call where we were a conference room, as it was very small and cluttered.
...The cramped space was packed with lockers. I had the impression that it was more of a change room that doubled as one for smoking.
Listening to his crude chortles, I didn't get much of a feeling that Hondaya, who was head of the local Public Safety Division, was much of an intellectual.
But I knew that, in exchange, he had both experience and absolute confidence in his instincts.

<Akasaka>
"I apologize for interrupting you during such a busy time.
 I'm Akasaka from the Metropolitan Police Department.
 Pleased to make your acquaintance."

<Hondaya>
"Hondaya from the Public Safety Division.
 Nice to meetcha.
 I was threatened by Sankai from the Prefectural Gangbusters to be generous with my cooperation.
 Wahahaha!"

<Akasaka>
"Gangbusters?
 You mean the Prefectural Crime Prevention Division?"

<Hondaya>
"You see, we're treating the Onigafuchi Guardians as an extension of the local yakuza.
 You'd have to be a newbie if you think they're just a residential protest group, wahahaha!"
They said at the prefectural office too that the Onigafuchi Guardians was linked to the local mob.
If I recall correctly, the adopted son of somebody influential was a lieutenant in that gang...

<Hondaya>
"It's the other way around.
 The complete opposite. The yakuza put up the protest group as a front to justify their actions. Just think of it like that.
 Completely the other way around.
 Wahahaha!"
Hondaya was just about rolling with laughter.
...This was slightly different than the info given to me at the prefectural office, but somebody embedded locally would be more knowledgable.
While we were talking, occasionally some people who seemed to be detectives would come in and change.
...One of those individuals, noticing Hondaya's guffaws, came up to us.

<Ooishi>
"I was wondering what you guys were talking about.
 Nfu fu fu fu!"

<Hondaya>
"Oh, Kura-chan!
 Perfect timing, why don't you join us?
 This here is Inspector Akasaka, who came all the way from the Tokyo Police Department."

<Akasaka>
"An Inspector?
 I-I'm still a rookie.
 My name is Akasaka, pleased to meet you..."

<Ooishi>
"It must be nice to be so fresh-faced.
 Did they hire you this year?
 Nfu fu fu!"
I couldn't help but think I was being ridiculed, so I only responded with a forced smile...
I could tell that this new person was like Hondaya, the type who had confidence in their instincts and experience.
 ...I really didn't like those types of people.

<Hondaya>
"Let me introduce you, Akasaka-san.
 This is Ooishi-kun from our Investigative Department.
 Regarding the S File you were asking about, he's familiar with it."

<Akasaka>
"...S File?"

<Ooishi>
"S for Sonozaki.
 If something is an S File, it means it has something to do with the Sonozaki family... it's something of a codename."
Sonozaki?
...Come to think of it, I remembered when I was poring over the documents at headquarters, there were quite a few people with the last name Sonozaki popping up.

<Akasaka>
"...If I remember right, there's a Sonozaki who is one of the executives of the Onigafuchi Guardians.
 I'm pretty sure they're the treasurer."
The two of them were surprised when I rattled off what post that Sonozaki held.
...After a moment, both of them erupted into laughter.

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san was it?
 Na ha ha ha!
 You're quite the studious one!
 Could it be you've memorized all of the central figures in the Alliance?
 Na ha ha ha ha!"

<Akasaka>
"I wouldn't say memorized, exactly, but I've at least read the list of Onigafuchi Guardians executives."

<Ooishi>
"Nfu fu!
 Then, who are the president and vice-president?"

<Akasaka>
"The president is the mayor of Hinamizawa, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi.
 The vice-president is the priest of the local shrine, Furude.
 The treasurer is Oryou Sonozaki, the auditor is Makino. 

<Akasaka>
The liaison is Yoshiroshi Kimiyoshi, the PR Head is Sadao Sonozaki..."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha...!!
 Akasaka-san, you're pretty good!
 The pay sucks, but you want to work here?
 You're just the type we're looking for.
 Nfu fu fu! 

<Ooishi>
...By the way, Sadao Sonozaki is head of the Youth Department.
 So close! The Head of Public Relations is actually Tadataka Sonozaki. Euheh heh heh!"
Feeling like I wasn't being complimented at all,  I started settling into an uncomfortable mood.
...However, I was becoming more and more aware that I was the weakest link in this investigation, so I just had to bear with it.
I didn't mean for that feeling to show up on my face, but the crafty detectives didn't let that slip by.

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha!
 I didn't mean to make fun of you.
 ...To make up for it, why don't I show you around the village?"
For somebody with no feel for the area like me, it would be a great help.
 I couldn't have asked for more.

<Ooishi>
"In the end, the Onigafuchi Guardians is nothing more than an alias Hinamizawa is using to deal with the outside world.
 ...I think getting to know the village would speed up your work.
 ...How about it?"
The residential movement, in other words, held influence over the whole region.
So the leader of the movement was the leader of that influence.
 Just like that, the thought processes in the region would become the overall personality of the movement.
...Just like Ooishi had said, in order to learn what they were really like, this regional force behind the dam protests, getting to know the village was the quickest way.

<Akasaka>
"...If you would!"
Nodding back without skipping a beat, Ooishi laughed in satisfaction and stood up.
If I took the information I learned at the prefectural office and from Hondaya to heart... if my position was exposed, my personal safety was at risk.
The opponent was an extremist group that had no qualms about using threats or violence against somebody.
If my personal info was leaked, it wouldn't be hard to imagine that I'd be in danger, whether on the job or not...
...Thinking that, I felt a little nervous.

<Ooishi>
"These guys are quick to remember faces.
 If you're seen with me, they'll probably do a lot to hinder your work.
 This might be a little cliche, but put these on."
Ooishi handed me an incredibly suspicious disguise comprised of a baseball cap, sunglasses, and a mask.
I didn't want to get all hot and stuffy, but Ooishi's warning was probably right on the money.
 ...Considering that, I put them on with appreciation.
I looked so suspicious that Ooishi had to smile wryly...

<Ooishi>
"...How much did I tell you again?
 ...Let's see..."

<Akasaka>
"To the part where you were talking about how these three ancient families control the village."
The Onigafuchi Guardians was the same as the village of Hinamizawa itself.
Meaning, there was a direct correlation between being an executive in the Alliance and being a leader in the village, as Hondaya had told me a short time ago.
If the village was ruled by three ancient families...
 then it would mean the Onigafuchi Guardians was ruled by those same three families.

<Ooishi>
"What did the documents at the prefectural office say?
 About the leader of the Guardians or whatnot."

<Akasaka>
"..."
...The documents I was using were classified.
If I responded to Ooishi's question it'd be a breach of security.
...However, most likely...
This man, I judged, was more well-versed in the situation than any of the documents at the prefectural police department, so I decided to answer him.

<Akasaka>
"That the president of the Alliance is the current mayor of the village, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi."
Ooishi, upon hearing that, let out a small chuckle.
For him to ask like that, and to laugh at the answer as it was recorded in the documents...
 ...meant that wasn't the case in reality.

<Akasaka>
"...So then... that means there's somebody else other than Kimiyoshi behind the scenes.
 Contrary to what the prefectural office thinks, or rather, what is commonly known."

<Ooishi>
"Nfu fu...
 Old man Kimiyoshi is nothing more than a figurehead.
 In the first place, the post of mayor in that village is nothing more than ceremonial."

<Akasaka>
"In other words... there's someone else in charge of both the Alliance and the village?
 Would that be the three families we just talked about?"

<Ooishi>
"Well, I'll explain that part right now.
 ...Nfu fu fu!"
All of a sudden,
 with a 'thunk,' the car suddenly lurched.
The paved road had given way to a gravel one.
 At the same time, the scenery outside the window changed.
"The Hinamizawa Dam Project Must Be Withdrawn"
"Overthrow the Shameless Puppet of a Governor!"
"The Dam Will Submerge the Natural Beauty of Hinamizawa!"
"Protect the Village from the Unethical Dam!"
"Fear the Wrath of Oyashiro-sama's Curse!"
"Demolish the Dam! Those Involved Must Go Away!"
"The Construction Office Must Respond!"
"The Construction Office Manager Must Negotiate With Us!"
Signs and banners crowded the roadside...
Even reading the brush-scrawled words was daunting.
It was as though where the road just changed was a border with a different country.
...At that moment, I was startled by the car suddenly braking.
Looking ahead... a barricade had been erected.
About 5 or 6 protestors, wearing masks and helmets to hide their faces, were blocking the road, yelling at us angrily to stop.

<Akasaka>
"...W-What is this!?
 A checkpoint!?"

<Ooishi>
"Hmph.
 ...These guys never learn."
Ooishi snorted as he rolled down the window and leaned out.

<Ooishi>
"Hey hey hey, you guys, you can't be blocking the road like this here."
As Ooishi glared at them with a malicious laugh, they visibly faltered.

<Ooishi>
"...Clear the way.
 We can't get by like this.
 Nfu fu fu!"
...Who would have thought it was Ooishi's car...
 That panicked thought seemed to make them lose their presence of mind.

<Man>
"...Ah, if we had known it was your car, Detective Ooishi, we wouldn't have been so rude.
 ...Detective, what happened to your usual car?
 Is it in for maintenance?"

<Ooishi>
"Something like that.
 I just can't get used to this car they loaned me, nfu fu fu!"
...Judging from their brief conversation, I could guess that they were familiar with the license plate of the car Ooishi normally used.
In other words, if they knew the car belonged to the police, they would have hidden the barricade.
What they were doing was obviously obstruction of traffic.
 A blatant crime.

<Man>
"...Who's that suspicious guy?
 You, could you show us your face?"
The man glared at me menacingly. Wearing a mask and sunglasses made me look particularly dubious.
...Would not showing my face get me into some unnecessary trouble...?
 I turned to Ooishi to see what I should do...

<Ooishi>
"Give him a break.
 He's still a shy little rookie, nfu fu!"

<Man>
"...We just wanted to make sure he wasn't anybody suspicious.
 ...Hinamizawa has been in a bit of a stir as of late."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha!
 Have you looked at yourself in the mirror?
 That mask you're wearing is way more suspicious!
 Na ha ha ha ha ha!"
The men and Ooishi continued to talk like that, feigning smiles at one another...
...However, from the beginning to the end, I couldn't get over the feeling I was sitting on a powder keg.

<Ooishi>
"Has the number of trucks illegally dumping still not decreased?
 It's a real hassle dealing with it all the time."

<Man>
"If the police could understand and cooperate it would really help... hahahaha..."
During that conversation, the barricade was moved, leaving a gap wide enough for a single car to get through.
Ooishi lightly honked the horn once, and began to roll the car forward.
I could see the men's antagonistic glares at the back of the car in the rearview mirror...

<Akasaka>
"What was that just now?
 Blocking a public road like that!"

<Ooishi>
"Of course it's a crime.
 Still, if you get worked up over that, it'll never end.
 Nfu fu fu! 

<Ooishi>
Those guys, see, claim there's an infestation of trucks illegally dumping in the village.
 Their story goes that in order to stop that, they're halting suspicious vehicles for inspection."

<Akasaka>
"Illegal dumping?
 Like corrupt contractors just tossing industrial waste away?"

<Ooishi>
"Their line of argument is that if the police aren't going to do anything about it, they'll take matters into their own hands.
 ...Well, the industrial waste is just something they're doing by themselves anyways."

<Akasaka>
"By themselves?"

<Ooishi>
"They have a pretty good strategy.
 You see, in order to hinder construction, they've spread industrial waste over by the dam site. 

<Ooishi>
...Then, blaming it on corrupt contractors, they start instituting these inspections.
 There, they stop every construction vehicle coming through and interfere with them as much as possible.
 Nfu fu fu!"

<Akasaka>
"...So then, it's one of the methods the Onigafuchi Guardians is using."

<Ooishi>
"With that inspection just now, this car's license plate has probably been recorded.
 ...It shouldn't get stopped from here on out.
 ...Those guys know very well not to get me angry.
 Na ha ha ha ha!"

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"See, rumor is that if they figure a car is related to the construction in some way,
 not only would there be checkpoints stopping it at every turn, but they'd be throwing rocks and planting road spikes as well. 

<Ooishi>
...It's best you be careful so you're not identified.
 If they find out you're from Public Safety, who knows what you'll suffer through...
 Nfu fu fu!"
Ooishi was acting like we were talking about something fun, but for me it was no laughing matter...

<Akasaka>
"...It almost feels like we've wandered into some country at civil war."

<Ooishi>
dialog006"Na ha ha ha ha ha!
 That's a good way of putting it.
 It's pretty much just what you said."
Ooishi turned to me with a grin and menacing laugh.

<Ooishi>
"You see, this here's a warzone."
The car slowed down a bit as it went down a narrow road through some farmland.

<Ooishi>
"You see that house in that forest over there?
 That antiquated one."
Looking at where Ooishi was pointing, there certainly was an old, traditionally-designed house.

<Ooishi>
"That belongs to the mayor, old man Kimiyoshi.
 You could say it belongs to the main Kimiyoshi house as well.
 There's a lot of branches, but
 they'd be one of the Three Families."

<Akasaka>
"...The Three Families.
 ...The ancient families that control Hinamizawa?"

<Ooishi>
"That's right.
 And, one of the others is the Furude family.
 Their house doesn't even have a single branch, as all that's left is the head priest's family.
 ...Right over there, there's the shrine. 

<Ooishi>
He's the priest there.
 By the way, the Guardians's office is on the grounds of that shrine."
The office of the Onigafuchi Guardians...
 ...if these guys were the enemy, that would make the shrine their stronghold.

<Akasaka>
"Can we go look over there?"

<Ooishi>
"The shrine is the Furude family's private property, you see.
 Being police, we can't set foot there without a warrant.
 See, they've got a member of the Diet with ties to the village backing them up. 

<Ooishi>
...Basically, being the police has its strengths and weaknesses."

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"Well, even when we talk about the Three Families...
 that's something from a long time ago.
 Way back when, those three families used to hold councils to decide things about the village."

<Akasaka>
"Meaning... it's different now?"

<Ooishi>
"...You've got a pretty good nose.
 That's what I expect from an academic.
 Nfu fu fu!"
The car braked to a halt with a squeal.
Ahead of where we were stopped were several signs.
"Private Property Beyond. No Trespassing."
"Beware of Poisonous Snakes!
 Danger! Turn Back!"
"Intruders Will Be Charged An Entry Fee of 1,000,000 yen."
Signs were erected there with things like that written on them.
The road was separated from the forest by a chain link fence wrapped in barbed wire...

<Ooishi>
"...Since this is private property, this is as far as we go.
 There's several surveillance cameras set up further in.
 Saying that we just got lost won't work with these guys."

<Akasaka>
"...They're beyond here, right?"
The people currently controlling Hinamizawa and the Onigafuchi Guardians were neither the Kimiyoshi family nor the Furude family, but
 the last of the three.

<Ooishi>
"Yeah.
 ...Beyond here is one of the Three Families, the Sonozaki family.
 They're the ones controlling Hinamizawa from the shadows."
...Among the list of executives recorded in the documents, the number of people with last names from the three families was quite high. 
...Of course, Sonozaki was no exception.
 However, at the top was the Kimiyoshi family.
...If the Kimiyoshi family seemed to be in charge, the rulers behind the scenes were the Sonozaki family.
This double-layered structure implicitly told me that this village had both a light and a dark side...

<Ooishi>
"The current head of the Sonozaki family is an old lady named Oryou.
 ...She has enough clout that you could call her 'Empress Sonozaki.' 

<Ooishi>
Be careful, she's no small fry.
 She's enough of a VIP that even the mayor of the city has to bow before her. 

<Ooishi>
...Well, in Hinamizawa and the surrounding area their relatives amount to a block of several thousand votes. No politician could show disrespect for that.
 Nfu fu fu!"

<Akasaka>
"In other words... That would make her the actual leader of the Onigafuchi Guardians, right?"

<Ooishi>
"You've got it."
With those words, Ooishi pulled out a well-worn cigarette box.
The suspected kidnapping of the Minister's grandchild and subsequent threats.
Were these part of the hidden plot by the Onigafuchi Guardians in order to have the Hinamizawa Dam Project cancelled?

<Ooishi>
"...You came all the way from Tokyo to investigate this, didn't you?"

<Akasaka>
"...Huh?
 Ah, yeah!
 That's right.
 ...Something the matter?"

<Ooishi>
"Ah, then...
 Is it related to that direct appeal incident with Minister Inukai?
 If that's the case, then Public Safety has them marked on a watchlist?
 Something like that?
 Na ha ha ha ha."

<Akasaka>
"Having you guess that so quickly makes this easy."
While exhaling out cigarette smoke, Ooishi smiled broadly, like I'd just pulled a good one on him...
 ...or so I thought. His smile disappeared suddenly.

<Ooishi>
"That's a lie, isn't it?"

<Akasaka>
"...Huh?"

<Ooishi>
"I mean, the direct appeal putting them on a watchlist.
 That's a lie, isn't it?"

<Akasaka>
"..."
Ooishi knew there was no way that Tokyo HQ would dispatch an investigator over something as minor as a direct appeal.
...If they were to dispatch someone, it had to be for a more... dire reason. He had figured out as much.
...I thought of myself as the type of person who doesn't let things show on their face.
 In front of his watchful gaze, however, I felt that what I was thinking was completely laid bare...
Ooishi silently lit another cigarette, as if waiting for me to interject during this awkward pause.
...I see... so this was a veteran detective's way of getting someone to spill information.
But, as long as I realized this, there would be nothing more.
...If I didn't open my mouth, I wouldn't have to lose anything.
All I had to do was stare out the window and enjoy the scenery until Ooishi gave up.

<Ooishi>
"Nfu fu fu!
 You really are bad at hiding things, you know.
 Being so young and earnest isn't so bad."
Ooishi smirked as he twisted out his third cigarette, while I tried not to let him notice that I had yielded completely.
...At first I'd thought I had won, but at the very least Ooishi had ascertained that I was hiding something.
...Meaning that I might have ended up marching to his tune.
Ooishi started up the engine once again, and began to move the car.

<Ooishi>
"...If you'd just been honest with me, I thought I might have been able to help you."

<Akasaka>
"...How would you help?"
If the cat was out of the bag, I might as well use it to catch some mice.

<Ooishi>
"Well, this depends on what we're talking about, but I might be able to set you up with someone who's knowledgeable about the goings-on in Hinamizawa."

<Akasaka>
"An informant?"

<Ooishi>
"...Nfu fu fu!
 I see, is that what you call it?"

<Akasaka>
"...Why are you interested in my case,
 Ooishi-san?"

<Ooishi>
"Well, I'm the same as you.
 ...Isn't it our business to know things?"
Being able to meet with Ooishi's informant was an extremely compelling opportunity.
We were looking to recruit somebody familiar with the area to collaborate with for intelligence.
In the end, there was no better method for finding people than asking.
We were always taught, however, that the rank-and-file police were no better than monkeys.
Unlike us, they were careless with confidential cases.
We looked down on them like they'd run their mouth off in a drunken stupor.
...Ooishi was an outlaw even amongst them. And here I was lost on whether or not I should tell him about the kidnapping of the minister's grandson.

<Akasaka>
"...This informant, exactly how knowledgeable are they about the Onigafuchi Guardians?"

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha!
 If you're from Public Safety, you'd know, wouldn't you?
 Something like that is something I can't just tell you."
...Protect your sources.
That was the first principle of dealing with confidential information.
...In that regard, it seemed that Ooishi wasn't one of those monkeys.
Should I trust him, ask for his help, or not?

<Ooishi>
"It's just that you work for the feds, and I work for the prefecture.
 I don't think that our jobs are that different.
 ...I think I can be of help."
...However, I had trouble believing that this crafty old man would simply help me just like he claimed.
 Now, how should I go about this....

<Akasaka>
"I find it hard to believe that someone of your standing would help me out without strings attached..."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha ha...
 Well, it's not like I'm completely without an ulterior motive.
 As I recall, you guys have space in your budget allocated to pay informants, right? 

<Ooishi>
Something you don't need to submit a receipt for.
 ...Just a little bit of that would be the cost of meeting with the informant."

<Akasaka>
"In other words, give the compensation earmarked for the informant to you first?
 ...Well, it helps that the details of this deal are so clear-cut."
He certainly was something else for being able to brazenly state his ulterior motive like this.
Rather than him doing this out of the kindness of his heart, everything was a lot clearer if he was being compensated for this deal.
 ...I felt that he was the type of man who was good at these backroom dealings.

<Ooishi>
"Don't misunderstand me, please.
 It's not me who needs the money, it's the informant, okay?
 Well, in regards to the payment, I'll be handling the money.
 Nfu fu!"

<Akasaka>
"When do you want it?"

<Ooishi>
"Right now would be good.
 If you don't have it on you, tomorrow works as well."
...I pulled out a wallet that was different from my personal one.
The price was pretty much fixed depending on what kind of information I was paying for. 
...In this case, the payment was up front. Also considering the fact I didn't know what kind of info I would get, I shouldn't pay too much...
When I suggested that, Ooishi suddenly stretched out his hand and tightly grasped the contents of the wallet.

<Ooishi>
"At times like this, it's best you not be so stingy.
 It's all right, it's all right, it won't go to waste."

<Akasaka>
"....I understand.
 I won't be stingy."

<Ooishi>
"And?
 What kind of information are you looking for?
 Depending on what you want, how we approach this will probably change..."

<Akasaka>
"...You swear you won't spread this information to anybody else,
 Ooishi-san?"

<Ooishi>
"I can't swear as much.
 I'm the same as you.
 I can't withhold information obtained during the course of my duties."

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha ha!
 I got it, I swear.
 Nothing here gets said anywhere else.
 On top of that, thanks to you, I can pay back my debts.
dialog007 In any case, I won't break a promise that involves money.
 Nfu fu fu!"
I was still unsure if I should trust him until the very last moment... but in the end, I broke down.
Ooishi wasn't the type of guy I could trust 100%, but there was no mistaking he had access to underground information networks.
 In order to accomplish my mission swiftly, I needed his cooperation.
...I set my resolve.

<Akasaka>
"I'm investigating whether or not the Onigafuchi Guardians is related to a certain incident."

<Ooishi>
"Certain incident?"

<Akasaka>
"There's a possibility that the Minister of Construction, Inukai, is being coerced by someone."

<Ooishi>
"...Saying there's a possibility is kind of a roundabout way of putting it."

<Akasaka>
"It appears there's a mole close to the minister.
 And due to that mole, the minister had been monitored quite thoroughly, and was seemingly forced to cede to their threats right away. 

<Akasaka>
None of this was reported to us or the police."

<Ooishi>
"...I see.
 So that's why you're saying there's only a possibility he's being coerced.
 ...In that case, isn't it a little strange? 

<Ooishi>
If the minister didn't report this to anybody, how did you guys know about this incident?"
If we didn't spy on the minister's private life, we would have never found out.

<Akasaka>
"...I don't think we have to provide that explanation to the informant, so I'm omitting it."
Ooishi had apparently caught on, and quietly chuckled when I refused to explain.

<Ooishi>
"I see.
 ...There's a spy close to the minister, so Public Safety made it a highly classified investigation.
 That certainly isn't a very amicable story, is it."

<Akasaka>
"If this matter became public, not only would this affect the minister's political career, but the possibility of there being a shift in the political landscape is extremely high. 

<Akasaka>
If the perpetrators' aim is indeed that, then this could develop into a very grave situation."

<Ooishi>
"...Well, with the government having development projects all over the country, they've butted heads with quite a few people. 

<Ooishi>
It wouldn't take much wrongdoing for the opposition parties to suddenly garner more support."

<Akasaka>
dialog008"We're currently investigating what demands are being forced on the minister.
 But at least we have a good idea of how he's being threatened."

<Ooishi>
"...How?"

<Akasaka>
"The minister's grandson... was kidnapped.
 They're denying it, but judging from when he was last seen, it's believed it's already been over 72 hours since the kidnapping."

<Ooishi>
"So, three days.
 ...If they were just after ransom money, this would have been settled by now."

<Akasaka>
"It may be this isn't for monetary gain. The possibility that they're forcing the minister to do something politically is extremely high.
 ...That's something we just can't consent to."

<Ooishi>
"So then, the Onigafuchi Guardians was listed as one of the possible perpetrators."

<Akasaka>
"That is correct."

<Ooishi>
"...Kidnap the minister's grandson, and demand the cancellation of the dam project...
 Hmm..."

<Akasaka>
"What do you think, Ooishi-san?
 ...From your point of view, do you think that's possible?"
Ooishi seemed to ponder the idea for a while.
The section chief at the regional office had responded immediately with: "It's possible."
...However Ooishi, who was this well-informed about the matter, was hemming and hawing...
...Finally, just a little bit...
...He said something that was really just a little bit strange.

<Ooishi>
"...This was before the Meiji Era, you see.
 This area wasn't named Hinamizawa Village back then--it was called Onigafuchi.
 ...Nahahaha, this is just what I heard from my mother."
...This topic was so completely and suddenly unrelated to the subject of the kidnapping of the minister's grandson that I was taken slightly aback.

<Akasaka>
"Onigafuchi?
 ...Oh, so that's why they're called the Onigafuchi Guardians."

<Ooishi>
"...You see, the village of Onigafuchi was said to be inhabited by demons that devoured humans.
 Even now, it's believed that the blood of these demons partially courses through the veins of the villagers."

<Akasaka>
"...D-Demons that devour humans??
 Ooishi-san... what are you saying?"

<Ooishi>
"It's information.
 I got a lot from you just now.
 A little too much.
 In exchange, I'm giving you a little freebie."
Ooishi finally smiled, but it didn't seem like he was fooling around.

<Akasaka>
"...Please continue."

<Ooishi>
"You see,  these human-devouring demons...
 Normally they were revered as Taoist 'transcendents,' and lived tucked away from the rest of the world. 

<Ooishi>
...But they ate people, after all, so apparently they'd go to villages in the foothills regularly and abduct their prey.

<Ooishi>
 ...They used to call that being 'demoned away,' or 'Onikakushi.'"
Demoned away...
...It was the first time I heard such a peculiar phrase.
However, I felt something slightly ominous from this horrifying tale of demons abducting people in order to eat them.

<Ooishi>
"...Look, you know how there's the common phrase 'spirited away'?
 When people suddenly go missing one day, they call it that.
 ...When the same thing happens around here, they call it being 'demoned away.'"

<Akasaka>
"...How does that old tale relate to the matter at hand?"

<Ooishi>
"...Oh no.
 There's no direct relationship, I'm just making some small talk here.
 It's just..."
Kathump kathump.
The car shook.
 ...At some point the gravel road had changed to a paved one.

<Akasaka>
"It's just...? Just what?"

<Ooishi>
"...That around here, the phrase 'demoned away' is somewhat of a code for disappearances and kidnappings. I just thought I'd mention that. 

<Ooishi>
I don't know if this has anything to do with the kidnapping of the minister's grandson.
 ...Well, there's no deep meaning behind it.
 It's just, there's that little bit of history, nfu fu fu fu....!"
"Onikakushi"... human-eating demons coming down to the foothills and abducting their prey.
Then... in order to cancel the dam project that threatened to submerge the village they lived in, did they 'demon away' the minister's grandson?
...Then, had they already made an example out of the minister's grandson and eaten him alive??

<Akasaka>
"...Hahahahaha.
 It's a bit of an interesting old tale, isn't it?"

<Ooishi>
"If you set foot into the demons' village without reason, you'll promptly be captured and eaten alive.
 So don't go near Onigafuchi. 

<Ooishi>
...Kids these days might not believe such superstitions,
 but amongst the older folk in Okinomiya born in the Meiji Era, many take it very seriously even now."
dialog009Hinamizawa Village was feared by the people in the area.
 I recalled that piece of information I heard from the Prefectural Public Safety Division.

<Ooishi>
"In any case, we're in the boonies out here.
 It's kind of expected that there'd be some superstitions around.
 Na ha ha ha ha! 

<Ooishi>
Somebody from Tokyo like you, Akasaka-san, probably couldn't even begin to imagine it, could you?"
...The man-eating demons, as the price for violating the sanctity of their village, kidnapped the minister's grandson... and swallowed him whole.
That ludicrous idea flew through my head.
...It was so absurd, I was half-disgusted with myself.
Ooishi was just teasing me.
...Stupid.
 It was all really so stupid.
...Come to think of it, by then, I may have already been seized by the curse of that dubious village.
...For me to realize that... would take a little more time...



[Himatsubushi Ch.2]

Waking up in a cheap hotel in the city was by no means pleasant.
I remembered even during the long camping trips we had during grade school, I wanted to get home quickly, counting out the days left on my fingers.
...Waking up this morning, I was somehow reminded of that.
...Was it a need to be with my wife when she gave birth? A particular type of homesickness?
As a productive member of society, as a public servant bound to fulfill his duties... it was pathetic indeed.
Those negative emotions faded as I downed my breakfast, which was surprisingly not half-bad...
The meeting with the informant that Ooishi had provided would be tonight.
Until then, I couldn't just be lazing around.
The Onigafuchi Guardians was protesting the dam's construction in various ways.
Included in this was a strategy for improving public relations, which could be categorized into two major forms: combative and peaceful.
In regards to the former, as an attempt to keep law enforcement in check, they appealed to the public's sympathy by highlighting the oppressive and inhumane tactics of the police and the brutality of the riot squads.
The latter, peaceful, route stressed how precious the natural surroundings of Hinamizawa was, seeking people who would oppose the dam on environmental grounds.
As a part of that, the village of Hinamizawa had invited celebrated zoologists and botanists, as well as environmental groups, to advertise the nature surrounding the town.
According to the news, in recent years there had been a group calling itself "Hinamizawa Nature Watching" setting up free sightseeing tours.
...I would have liked to have taken advantage of the opportunity, but when I called the village administrative offices, they said it was too late to apply for the tour, and they were still undecided as to when they'd be doing another one.

<Akasaka>
"...I see.
 So there's no applications for next time.
 ...Too bad."

<Village Officer>
"Are you a member of an environmental group?
 Or maybe somebody from a magazine?"

<Akasaka>
"No, just here privately."

<Village Officer>
"Privately? Then you're a tourist?"

<Akasaka>
"...Something like that.
 It's my hobby to take pictures that display how beautiful nature can be.
 I read in a magazine that there were some precious nature reserves here, so I was looking forward to it..."
I knew there was an article that had something like that written in it, but I hadn't actually read it.
Was it this ad-libbed lie not going to work...?
However, contrary to my expectations, the person I was speaking to laughed happily.

<Village Officer>
"Wa ha ha!
 Then come, come.
 The village is a little busy right now, but you're totally welcome here!
 Wahahahaha!"

<Akasaka>
"In that case, I'll graciously accept the offer. Thank you."

<Village Officer>
"How are you getting around?
 Car?
 If that's the case, could I ask you for your license plate number?
 No, no, there's no ulterior motive behind that... wahahahaha!"
That was probably related to the checkpoints they'd set up on the way to the village.
 If I didn't give them my license plate number, I'd most likely be hindered in various ways...
I thought about using the car I had borrowed from the prefecture, but I was lost on whether it was okay to tell them that plate number.
...If the Onigafuchi Guardians was behind this incident...
 There was no guarantee that they wouldn't be able to find out who I was.
...I had to play it safe, so I elected to refrain from using the car.

<Akasaka>
"No... actually, I'm not using a car.
 If there's a bus or something, I'd prefer that..."

<Village Officer>
"We do have a bus, actually.
 The route is going to be discontinued soon, though.
 You can take that.
 It departs from Okinomiya Station."

<Akasaka>
"Thank you very much.
 I'll look out for it."

<Village Officer>
"When will you be coming?
 Is it your first time in Hinamizawa?
 If it is, you must be unsure about a lot of things.
 If you let me know, I can have somebody show you around."

<Akasaka>
"Oh no... I couldn't ask that much of you."

<Village Officer>
"Wahahahaha!
 Don't worry about it.
 That's just a bit of PR we do, to protect nature around the village~."
Judging by what I saw at the checkpoint, the villagers were at the very least wary of outsiders.
That's why in order to move in and out of the village freely, I had to travel with somebody like Ooishi, or side with the dam protests.
Having an interest in the natural environment surrounding the village tied into the peaceful type of PR that the village was using. 
...I was a bit against having a watchdog attached to me, but that might actually work out in my favor.
The entire village was fired up about the dam protests, so I might be lucky enough to hear some especially candid opinions from the residents.
...Given that, there was no real reason for me to refuse their offer.

<Akasaka>
"Is it really all right...?
 If so, that'll really help."
After that, I was shown the bus schedule, and directed to which bus I should get on.
 Somebody would come and meet me at the bus stop in the village.
...After showing me around a spot I'd take an interest in, there was no doubt they'd bring me to somewhere like an anti-dam information center.
Then, over a cup of tea, they'd try and indoctrinate me into accepting their principles and beliefs.
Well, if that was their aim, there'd be a lot freebies involved. The world is about give and take, after all.
...I couldn't be going in a suit.
I pulled some plain clothes out of my travel case, and changed into something more casual.
After that, after calming down by watching some local television, I left the hotel and set out for Okinomiya Station.
The bus route that I was told would soon be discontinued certainly didn't look that way.
There was more than enough trips on the schedule, and the number of passengers was by no means sparse.
It was the main link to Okinomiya, the only town in the area.
The types of passengers that stood out were older folk who didn't look like they could drive and housewives who didn't seem like they had a license.
...If the area was submerged at the bottom of the lake, it wouldn't matter if there was a bus route.
That's why it was going to be discontinued... in the unnatural scheme of things.
I could catch a glimpse of the government's intent in cutting off their means of transportation to bully the village into emptying out sooner.
It makes sense... according to the documents, talks between the Ministry of Construction and the locals broke down quite early.
...The government decided from the start to take an aggressive stance on the matter.
...It was like the fairy tale with the North Wind and the Sun trying to get the traveler remove his cloak.
 ...Even their bullying had meaning to it.
The reason why the Onigafuchi Guardians resisted so violently... was because the government was doing unseemly things like that.
I was somebody who lived in Tokyo, so for a village or two out in the boonies like this to be submerged didn't seem like a big deal.
...But, I guess for somebody actually living here, it would be a vitally huge problem.
"This route will be discontinued at the end of this financial year.
 Thank you for your patronage up to this point.
 We look forward to your continued patronage on our other lines.
 Okinomiya Transportation."
Gazing lazily at the notice of discontinued service posted inside the bus, I counted down the number of stops until the designated one...
Along the way, we passed through the checkpoint before without stopping.
They knew what time the bus was coming, so they had opened up the barricade ahead of time.
...From here on out was enemy territory.
My palms had at some point become coated in a thin film of sweat...

<Bus Announcer>
"Now arriving at Ukita Waterworks~.
 Now arriving at Ukita Waterworks~.
 Are there any passengers disembarking?"
I hurriedly pressed the stop request button as the designated stop was announced.
...For none of the numerous passengers to be getting off here meant that it must be quite a remote place.
In actuality, the stop I got off at was so abnormally run-down that I could tell it was barely used.
As soon as I stepped out, an intense atmosphere completely different than the interior of the bus assailed my body.
Right now, Ooishi or Hondaya weren't beside me.
That's right--at present, I was alone in the middle of enemy territory.
My adversaries probably thought I was just an ordinary tourist, but that was nothing more than a ruse.
 ...But if by some mistake my true identity was to be exposed
...
It brought back the terrifying words I had heard at the prefectural office... that if somebody was attacked in Hinamizawa with a knife, there wouldn't be any evidence left behind...
...I didn't seem suspicious, did I?
My clothing was currently casual.
It was exactly the type of clothing that a city slicker that viewed the countryside as a wholesome getaway would wear.
A camera and knapsack.
 Inside were various things needed for hiking.
...It was still only June, and maybe it was unusual, but the sun was shining down like it was already the middle of summer.
...The fact that I didn't bring a hat must seem odd...
 ...No... It wasn't something to be that concerned about...
It's alright... ...I was just a normal tourist.
 ...Just normal.
 Was there anything suspicious about me...?
Asking that, as I turned around to look at the bus that was departing...
 ...All the passengers by the window were staring down at me, silently.
They were... staring right at me...
 ...As if they had seen right through my proud little outfit...
 ...Just staring...
 looking down on me.
Countless stares rained down like needles on me from the windows opened to air out the bus.
...All that rained down were stares.
...None of them... were saying a word.
...But, all the more...
...Their silent stares told me more than a million words could.
...Hurry up and go back to Tokyo.
 You outsider.

<Akasaka>
"....N-no... I'm..."
There was no reason for me to speak.
...My quiet voice was drowned out by the sound of the engine.
The bus, as if to torment me... set out slowly, and after doing more than enough to intimidate me, sped off...
...A thin film of sweat began to rise from my entire body.
According to the documents, it was a village that seemed wary of outsiders.
 ...Its population was small, as well.
If they saw an unfamiliar face, they would be quick to identify that face as an outsider.
...On top of that, nobody else had gotten off at this stop.
...It was a bus stop that they normally just passed on by.
Somebody actually getting off there... there was no doubt that had drawn some attention.
...But... this wasn't a slip-up...
They were the ones who directed me to get off at this stop.
 ...There was nothing... to worry... about.
...I knew that I was just nervous, since this was my first undercover assignment.
...My more seasoned colleagues referred to us as "the new generation that didn't know how to lose their cool"... but that wasn't true at all..

<Akasaka>
".....Phew."
In order to calm my breathing down... I exhaled the unpleasant air residing in the pit of my stomach.
I couldn't help but pray that my apprehensions would disappear like the white clouds of exhaust expelled from the bus.
There was a small shed there to serve as shelter if it rained, and it was there I decided to wait.
Inside the shed, one wall was plastered with posters advertising the dam opposition efforts.
It was like the heartfelt screams of the villagers were recorded on that wall.
 ...Inside that shelter, I felt an inexplicable pressure.
...It wasn't like I had any real relation to the dam project, but it still made me feel hesitant about being inside there.
 That was just how filled with the force of denial that space was.
And... inside that uneasy space... was a girl.
Inside that shed covered in words written in broad brush strokes berating the policies regarding the dam and calling for action... there was a girl sitting there with a drowsy gaze, as if half asleep.
The two images clashed so much that I could only stand there dumbfounded for a moment, trapped in such a surreal environment.
If I stepped inside, who knew what kind of oafish noises I would accidentally make.
...I couldn't be disturbing this girl's slumber like that...
Having thought this, I gave up on entering the shed.
It was just a sleeping kid, so why was I so worked up about it?
...Finally, I realized.
This girl... to us, as a married couple, was the very image of our ideal child.
Even after numerous examinations at the hospital, we didn't know for sure what our child's gender was. 
...Whether we could tell if they were a boy or a girl was, in the end, dependent on whether or not we could get an image of their genitalia.
There was, of course, no guarantee that it was a girl... but with things the way they were, the possibility was high.
Even so, Yukie had been saying that the chances that it was a boy or a girl were even.
...But in my heart, I had already decided that our coming child... was a girl.
Since the day I decided that until now... it was so fun to imagine how our child would grow up that I couldn't help myself.
Amongst those numerous imagined forms... the one that I thought to be the most ideal had materialized right in front of me.
...Of course, a little of it was due to the circumstances.
...In my ideal image, her hair would be on the short side.
 The girl in front of me, though, had long hair.
It was almost if... somebody had taken my ideal and made some small adjustments...
 ...It certainly wasn't something unpleasant.
Even so, I felt like I was sullying her just by looking at her like that.
..She had an immaculate... no, a divine air about her.

<Little Girl>
"Hngh... waaaa....."
That girl with an angelic smile, with a yawn wide enough you could see her molars, woke up all of a sudden.
...I didn't mean to peep.
...But locking eyes with a girl who had just woken up like this... somehow made me feel like I was playing a prank on her.
 I wasn't doing anything shady... but I became flustered.
The girl spoke.
 ...No... cried out?

<Little Girl>
"...Meep."
...Meep?
Like that character on the show with the puppets?
 With the orange hair?
I thought it was just one of those greetings kids do.
...So in order to prove I wasn't a suspicious person... I responded in kind.

<Akasaka>
"...Meep."

<Little Girl>
"...Meep?"

<Akasaka>
"...Mee ...meep..."
The girl, stared at me dubiously with a doll-like expression--cute, but cold and hard to read.
...Well... I wouldn't be surprised.
...There was after all, an unfamiliar man right in front of her when she woke up, who responded with 'meep' when she said the same.
...Suspicious.
 She definitely thought I was suspicious.

<Little Girl>
"...Meep."

<Akasaka>
"...Mee... .....Meep..."

<Little Girl>
"..."

<Akasaka>
"......"
We were both at a loss for words.
No, the only one lost was me...
...The girl in front of me, as if inquiring about my motives, stared at me intently.
In this silence... I felt like I was the one who had to say something first.
...Dammit ...This girl was way better at interrogating somebody than Ooishi...

<Akasaka>
"I--I'm not anybody suspicious...
 ...I'm...."

<Little Girl>
"...Nipah~~☆."

<Akasaka>
"Ni.... Nipah...??"

<Little Girl>
"Nipah~~~☆."
What I could have only described as a cold expression suddenly blossomed into a smile, one that soon infected me.
...You might be familiar with the term 'angelic smile'... to me, it was like that phrase was created just to describe the smile she gave me...
The girl smiling while saying "nipah~~," probably wanted me to return the favor in kind...
That's right... this was a kid's form of communication.
Having the other person emulate what you just did was a rudimentary form of mutual understanding...

<Akasaka>
"Ni... Nipaaah...☆"

<Little Girl>
"...Nipah~~☆."
...It was a beautiful afternoon in the early summer.
...What... was I doing?

<Little Girl>
"...Nipah~~☆."

<Akasaka>
"Ni, ...Nipah~~~♪."
...Well, whatever...
 This was interesting in its own way...
If making somebody happy with just a smile was the work of angels...
 ...then this girl was definitely one of them.
...I couldn't help but pray that my own child, who was soon to be born... would grow up to be like this girl...
That strangely gentle moment, was finally brought to the end by the arrival of a car.
An older person waved at me from the driver's seat, a dry smile plastered on their face.

<Old person>
"Hi there, good afternoon~!
 Sorry for being late!
 You're the tourist who phoned yesterday, right?"

<Akasaka>
"Huh? Ah... yes!"

<Old person>
"Sorry to keep you waiting.
 I'm running a little behind because of the farm!
 Hop right on in.
 It looks like the weather isn't going to hold up for much longer, so I'll show you around real quick."

<Akasaka>
"...Huh? The weather?"

<Old person>
"It changes fast around here~.
 There'll probably be evening showers again today.
 If that happens, you won't be able to take any pictures.
 Come on, get in, get in."

<Little Girl>
"...Meep."
Turning around, the girl was standing right behind me with an intrigued expression.
...Her body language somehow reminded me of a stray cat that followed you around after you played with it a little... so charming.

<Old person>
"Hmm... well if it isn't Rika-chama!!
 Praise be... praise be~..."

<Little Girl>
"...Nipah~~☆."
A girl named Rika with an immaculate smile, and an old man praising her while rubbing prayer beads in his hands.
 ...It was a rather mysterious sight to behold.
...So, the girl turns her face at me, tilting her head a little in a cutesy manner. After seeing that, the elder introduces me as a tourist who came to sightsee Hinamizawa.

<Little Girl>
"...A young'un who came to the village for sightseeing."
The girl, Rika-chan, said that with a smile as she clung onto my arm.

<Akasaka>
"Well... yeah.
 I heard that this village is surrounded by a precious nature reserve, so I very much wanted to record that with my camera.
 ...Even though I look like this, I really like to take pictures..."

<Rika>
"...Tomitake Mk. II."

<Akasaka>
"Huh?
 Tomitake??
 Huh??"

<Rika>
"...Makino.
 Is it okay if I come along too?"

<Old person>
"I-I couldn't. You could come along, Rika-chama, but there's nothing interesting to see!
 You should go play near the shrine or something!"

<Rika>
"...Meep."
A distinctly displeased expression creeped across Rika-chan's face.
Being able to show one's emotions honestly on their faces was a privilege young children had.

<Akasaka>
"If it's not too much of a problem, could you bring this child along with us?"
When I said those helpful words, another smile spread across Rika-chan's face with another nipah~~ as she clung to me again.
...Aaah...
 ...Not bad at all...
 I want this girl... to call me Papa...
 ...No,
 ...Father,
 Dad...
 ...Daddy...
 ...Hrrrnnnngh...☆
...What am I doing?
...Ever since I met this girl, I was completely off my game...
 ...Just calm down.

<Old person>
"Nothing I can do, I guess.
 Rika-chama never listens even if you say no.
 ...Come on, hop on in.
 Come now, Rika-chama too."
The old man descended from the driver's seat and opened up the sliding door of the van, which had "Onigafuchi Alliance Town Council" stenciled on the side.
Rika-chan brushed me aside, dove into a seat, and began bouncing around right away.
...It seemed like she was thoroughly enjoying the bouncy springs.

<Old person>
"Come on now, Rika-chama!
 If you're like that our guest can't sit down!!
 Hey, Rika-chama!!"
.....Haa ...girls are nice...
I wonder if my child will play around like this, too...
No no no no!
 It was written in that guide to raising a child that you shouldn't dote on them...
Kids are kids... If you don't raise them strictly without spoiling them...

<Rika>
"...It's soft and springy, nipah~~~☆."

<Akasaka>
"Ni... Nipah~~...☆"
...I am definitely going to be a terrible father...
 It was decided that I would be a doting parent before my child was even born.

<Old person>
"Well then sir, I'll show you around some places that I think look nice.
 Have you eaten lunch yet?"

<Akasaka>
"Yeah.
 I had a light meal at the hotel."

<Old person>
"Is that so?
 Well then, let's get going."

<Rika>
"....We're setting off on a tour of Hinamizawa.
 Yaaa~y."

<Akasaka>
"Ummm, is it all right if I call you Rika-chan?"

<Rika>
"...Sure.
 My name is Rika Furude.
 I can already do addition in the tens digit."

<Akasaka>
"Oh, is that true?
 That's... amazing.
 Hahaha."

<Rika>
"...I don't count on my fingers.
 I can do it all in my head."
The way she insisted upon that was just too cute.
At some point, the nervousness I had about being alone in enemy territory had evaporated like it was never there at all.
...I had to be at least a little thankful that I met this girl.

<Old person>
"Well then, let's get going!!
 It's time for Hinamizawa Nature Watching!"
The old man stepped on the gas with a great deal of gusto.
...The old man (who was apparently named Makino...
 ...was he the same Makino that was listed as the auditor of the Onigafuchi Guardians?) 
showed me around places that were all breathtaking.  Even though I wasn't really here for sightseeing, I couldn't help but be impressed.
First of all, this was different from the simple scenery of a city. The scenery of a charming village like this, no matter how mundane it seemed to the villagers, had a tranquil appeal to it.
At first I was only releasing the shutter as part of my tourist act, but midway through I found myself taking pictures out of pure interest.
Tourist traps had their own unique allure to them, but there was nothing like that here.
 ...I was especially captivated by the unspoiled nature of the place.
...If there wasn't that whole uproar over the dam, I would want to bring Yukie with me here some other time.
 I wanted her to breathe in this fresh air, as well as show her this rejuvenating verdant scenery.

<Rika>
"....Is something like this that interesting?
 You're a strange person, Akasaka."

<Akasaka>
"No, these cylindrical mailboxes are rare nowadays.
 They have a certain nostalgic air about them... you wouldn't happen to think they're elegant, would you?
 Hahahahaha."

<Rika>
"...Is Hinamizawa fun?"

<Akasaka>
"Hm?
 ...Yeah. It's fun.
 Once she's discharged from the hospital, I'd like to bring my wife here at least once.
 ...With the child that would born by that time."

<Rika>
"..."

<Akasaka>
"Right now she's in the hospital waiting to give birth.
 ...She's due any day now.
 ...Haha, it'd be nice if they're a cute girl like you."

<Makino>
"Sir, it seems like congratulations are soon to be in order!
 Still, that's not good!
 To leave your wife behind and play around in a place like this!"

<Akasaka>
"..."
I was momentarily at a loss for words.
...It was exactly how Makino said.
There was no good reason for a man who was waiting for his wife to give birth to be playing around idly in this place.
 ...Did I slip up?

<Akasaka>
"Ah... ahhhh... well!
 We had already planned this trip to Hinamizawa a long time ago...
 ...My wife's family is with her, so it's all right."

<Makino>
"If you had this planned so far in advance,
 then how come you didn't make the sign-up deadline for the Nature Watching?
 If you did, you could have toured around on a nice bus instead of being cramped up in here."
It didn't seem as if Makino was actually digging for anything.
...But, if this conversation continued any longer, it would put some unexpected holes in my cover.
...I halted the conversation by pretending to take another picture.

<Makino>
"Well then, for our last stop, I'll take you to the place with the best view!"
It was slightly before evening. The sun was still burning brightly, but a cool breeze had begun to mix itself into the air.
It seemed my exploration of Hinamizawa with Rika-chan was just about done.

<Rika>
"...The place with the best view?"

<Makino>
"Well Rika-chama, where else could it be but the view from around the shrine?"
Hearing that, Rika-chan smiled even more.

<Rika>
"...Well then, I'll introduce you to my home, Akasaka."

<Akasaka>
"Huh?
 By Rika-chan's home, you mean... huh?"

<Makino>
"The shrine.
 Furude Shrine.
 There's an observation platform.
 You can see some real pretty scenery!"

<Akasaka>
"...Furude... Shrine."
The girl who called Furude Shrine her home, Rika.
...If I remembered correctly, her full name was Rika
 Furude.
....And Furude was... that's right.
 ...One of the Three Families.
Even if the Sonozaki family is said to hold all the actual power... it was still one of the old houses that held some authority.
...No, more important than that right now was... Furude Shrine.
If I remembered correctly, Ooishi had told me.
...Within the grounds of the Furude Shrine, there were the offices of the Onigafuchi Guardians.
...And since the land around Furude Shrine were private property, the police couldn't set foot there heedlessly.
Furude Shrine... where even Ooishi couldn't simply set foot into.
 The main base of operations for the Onigafuchi Guardians.
I had been given the unexpected opportunity to enter there.
 ...I couldn't have asked for more.

<Akasaka>
"I-I'm looking forward to it.
 Please, if you would."

<Makino>
"Well then, let's get there quick!
 The weather seems to be getting a little iffy!"
The sky had suddenly become overcast.
...It wouldn't be odd if it started raining soon.
The cicadas, as if trying to finish their daily allotment of chirps before the evening, cried out even more fervently.



[Himatsubushi Ch.3]

The van stopped in the shrine's parking lot.
Also parked there were numerous other vans with loudspeakers mounted on top of them to act as makeshift propaganda vehicles.
On the side of each vehicle was scrawled: "The Dam Project Must Be Demolished,"
 "Defend our Homeland to the Last!"
 "Know Oyashiro-sama's Anger!" 
or a slogan of a similar kind. They gave the feeling that even without using the loudspeakers, there was enough to overwhelm any onlookers.
Vertical banners were erected in various places.
...The contents of those banners were similar.
They were all objections against the dam, or crude insults towards the government.
 There were horizontal banners, placards, and so on and so forth...
...They proclaimed that without a doubt, this was the headquarters of the Onigafuchi Guardians.
For Rika-chan, however, this hectic place was also her home.

<Rika>
"...We've arrived.
 I'm home."
Rika-chan crawled over my lap and exited the vehicle first.
Makino had noticed that I was looking at protest banners.

<Makino>
"The shrine also has the offices of the Anti-Dam Movement.
 For you, this probably brings back memories of the anti-security treaty conflicts back in the day! Heh heh heh heh!"
...Student movements against government policies, movements that bordered on terrorist activity, were at one time commonplace, if only in order to garner global attention.
Students holding out in lecture halls, brawling with the riot squads that charged in...
It was an age where wasting one's youth like that was widely considered a road to glory.
 ...It was slightly before my time.

<Akasaka>
"I'm not really an activist or anything.
 I studied without incident, and graduated without incident.
 I don't really agree with the violence or occupations they used to protest the government's policies."

<Makino>
"...Ooh?
 ...You have quite the nice opinion there..."

<Akasaka>
"...If you have an opinion on a policy, vote for the candidate who shares your view, or enter the political world yourself and assert your beliefs in a lawful manner.
 That is the foundation of democracy. 

<Akasaka>
I don't think that's something you should challenge with violence."
For a young'un... you have some fine beliefs.
...I saw that feeling of respect reflected in Makino's gaze.
At that moment, something tugged at my sleeve.

<Rika>
"...I have no idea what Akasaka is saying."
Rika-chan, feeling like she was the only one who didn't understand the conversation, had a look of displeasure on her face.
 That expression was so charming, I had to keep myself from grinning like an idiot.
It's often said that a father wants to spoil his daughter rotten... I think I understood that feeling very well.

<Akasaka>
"Sorry.
 ...It was a little bit hard for Rika-chan to understand, wasn't it?
 ...Japan is a peaceful country, so you have to argue your point in a peaceful manner.
 You shouldn't resort to violence, in other words."
No matter how much I explained, a girl who was just boasting about being able to carry digits over when adding things probably wouldn't understand. 
...It probably wasn't something to talk about in front of Rika-chan, anyway.

<Rika>
"...So then, Akasaka.
 ...How do you think we should keep our village from being flooded by the dam?"
Even if I regretted my careless words, it was too late now.
Here I was, at the main headquarters of an organization, telling them their way of doing things was illegal...
Preaching that violence was not the answer...
A complicated feeling had mixed itself in with the respect in Makino's gaze. It was then I finally realized...
...It wasn't that simple.
There wasn't a soul who would argue that what I was saying wasn't correct.
Using violence to get one's way was something that everybody knew you shouldn't be proud of.
However... right now... Hinamizawa was in a predicament that couldn't be overcome with peaceful means alone.
The legality of the Hinamizawa Dam Project, through the efforts of the various propaganda campaigns enacted by the Onigafuchi Guardians, was being called into question.
...If they further strengthened their campaign... they might be able to suspend or change the construction plans.
But... that was at the most just a possibility.
If the government proceeded with the construction as planned, it wouldn't be long before this place was at the bottom of a lake.
...If it wasn't for the unrestrained resistance of the residents of Hinamizawa, this place might already have been underwater.

<Rika>
"...We can't live anywhere else other than here.
 ...We can't live in the city."
The words of this remarkably young girl were all too accurate, carrying with them the screams of the hearts and minds of the residents of Hinamizawa.
Of course... there was nothing I could say to respond to that.
...I could only respond to Makino and Rika-chan's heavy words with silence...

<Akasaka>
"...I'm sorry.
 ...This isn't a problem that an outsider should lightly just poke their nose into, is it?
 ...I apologize."
Makino, unsure of how to reply for a while, could only laugh pointlessly.

<Makino>
"Heh... heh heh heh!
 It's nothing that concerns guests that make their home somewhere else.
 If you enjoy it here... please tell all your friends that Hinamizawa is a wonderful place, please. 

<Makino>
If word spreads to dozens, maybe even hundreds of people... then that ridiculous plan to submerge this place at the foot of a dam will eventually fall apart."
He followed that with a smile that said: "please don't think much of it."
Makino letting me not worry that much really was a stroke of good fortune.
Becoming infatuated with the idea of making friends with a little girl had made me completely forget my apprehension at being in enemy territory. 
...Being reminded of this right before I was going to step foot into their headquarters... might have been a good thing.
If we'd had this exchange in the middle of their office...
...If there was a short-tempered youth in there, they might have come at me.
...Thinking of how extreme they were... in the worst case, my life could have been in danger.
It seemed that I looked quite despondent at that moment.
Makino, thinking he had said something wrong, became flustered trying to think of a way to improve my mood...

<Akasaka>
"I was a bit careless just now.
 I'm very sorry."

<Makino>
"No...
 Don't worry that much about it..."

<Akasaka>
"The sights you showed me around the village were all beautiful, wonderful places.
 ...I really do want to come here one more time. 

<Akasaka>
...If this beautiful village is going to be submerged at the bottom of a lake... I can understand why you would fight so desperately."
I had somehow managed to use my despondent look to change the topic in my favor.
After a bit, Makino had returned to his usual high spirits. It seemed he believed I completely sympathized with his point of view.

<Makino>
"Now now!
 Let's leave the talk at that for now.
 There's a place around here with a really great view!"

<Rika>
"...Let's go, Akasaka."
Rika-chan, seemingly happy to be free from all the boring and gloomy adult talk, bounded up the stone steps.
There was no real need to run, but in order to catch up with her, I also darted up the steps...
There were several tents belonging to the town council erected on the shrine grounds.
Inside the tents were several folding tables and chairs, and a number of the older town council members were livening things up with chit-chat.
They weren't saying anything incendiary, like "The Dam Project Must Be Destroyed!"--it was just some relaxed idle chit-chat between local geezers.
 ...The normal sort of calming scenery.
...At the entrance of a shed that looked like a meeting place, there was a large sign erected, with "Onigafuchi Guardians Headquarters" written in bold brush strokes.
That was... their base of operations.
...To be honest... it was a bit of a let-down.
If you asked what I had been imagining...
 This is a bit embarrassing, but I'd have thought it would be something much more dramatic.
 With barbed wire fences and barricades...
My first impression of the place, though, was completely different from that... it looked like a simple, backwater town hall.
 ...It didn't look like anything other than exactly that.
The old folks who were chatting had noticed Rika-chan's presence.

<Old person>
"Well isn't it Rika-chama.
 It's time for little kids to head on home!"

<Rika>
"...This is my home."
The old folks guffawed, since she wasn't wrong.
From that exchange, I could tell that this Rika Furude girl was loved by everybody.

<Kiichiro>
"Makino-san, who's that?
 The tourist who phoned?"

<Makino>
"That's right.
 This is the mayor of Hinamizawa. Mayor Kimiyoshi."
He smiled brightly... but there was no mistaking he would be scary if he got angry. By the looks of things, this old man was the president of the Onigafuchi Guardians, none other than Kiichirou Kimiyoshi himself...

<Kiichiro>
"Welcome to Hinamizawa.
 What do you think?
 ...It's a quiet and relaxing place, isn't it?"

<Akasaka>
"...Y-Yeah!
 I was able to appreciate a multitude of beautiful places throughout the whole day.
 I'm thankful for being granted this rare opportunity."

<Kiichiro>
"...Hmmm...
 Even though you're one of those young'uns, you're quite the gentleman...
 Mmmhmm."

<Rika>
"...Kiichirou.
 I want to show Akasaka a cool place."
Thinking that the formalities between myself and the mayor had gone on for too long, Rika-chan butted in to the conversation.
...For her to call the mayor by his first name...
 ...I felt it was a little strange, but none of the villagers seemed to mind.
...A girl of the Furude Household, one of the Three Families.
...She was probably different than the average villager.

<Rika>
"...Akasaka, over here."
Rika-chan tugged at my sleeve.
Not resisting, I allowed myself to be pulled over...
 ...and waiting for me was a magnificent view.

<Akasaka>
"...This is... amazing..."
It was an observation deck that looked down on the village.
They, knowing that this was the best view in the entire village, kept quiet as I stood there awestruck.
...I was holding a camera, but had completely forgotten to even glance through the viewfinder.
This view... no matter what kind of film it was printed on, it wouldn't be able to show everything.
If there was a way to explain it... it would only be what I would be able to put into words.
It was just such a breathtakingly spectacular view that I struggled to find a comparison.
For a while, I was left awestruck.. I could only stand there in wonder.
A cool breeze helped abate the heat rushing through my body.
 ...That comfortable sensation also left me speechless...
Rika-chan, who had been holding onto my sleeve the entire time, spoke.

<Rika>
"...This is my favorite spot."
As she said that, she showed me another adorable smile.
That smile seemed very fleeting.
...If you ask why, that was because the view from her favorite spot... would eventually be submerged under the deep green waters of the dam reservoir.

<Akasaka>
"...I just can't believe that this village is going to end up at the bottom of a lake."
I said it quietly so that only Rika-chan could hear it.
...I regretted it as soon as I did.
 ...For those words were all too cruel.
However, Rika-chan didn't let them cast a cloud on her expression.
...In fact, she replied with a smile.

<Rika>
"...It won't sink.
 The dam project will definitely go away."
It was just like a little girl to say something like that.
There was no basis for her saying so.
 It was just her wish.

<Rika>
"...Akasaka, do you think that this village will be submerged?"

<Akasaka>
"...It's not that I want it to be."
...I knew how important the dam was.
I knew that it was necessary.
...I just didn't want to recognize the sacrifices that would be made.
I agreed with the project in general, but couldn't agree with some of the details...
But... if it meant that this girl's beloved scenery wouldn't be taken away from her...
 ...I might be able to object to the dam.
...I might be able to ignore the interests of the nation, the development of Japan, all for the sake of one girl's smile...
 ...I'm not really much of a humanist but...
...
 ...how sentimental of me...

<Rika>
"...It won't be submerged.
 Because the dam project will soon go away."
Her words weren't just hopes and dreams... but were seasoned with a hint of resolve.
As if she was talking about an unchangeably predetermined outcome.
As surely as the sun rising in the east...

<Akasaka>
"...It'll be gone soon...?"
Wanting to ask her why she believed that... I turned around.

<Rika>
"...Yes.
 ...It'll be gone."

<Akasaka>
"What makes you say that?"

<Rika>
"...Well, you see...
..."
She seemed to want to answer, but as though unable to find the right words, she swallowed back what she was about to say.

<Rika>
"...Regardless of what Akasaka does...
 The dam project will end this year.
 It's already been decided."
That was a lie.
If something like that had already been decided, then the Onigafuchi Guardians would have no reason to continue existing.
From my point of view, it was like they were doing nothing more than throwing themselves into an endless battle.
If they knew the dam project was cancelled... it would feel much more relaxed around here.
 ...This village, though, could hardly be called relaxed.
...For evidence of that, I just had to remember how charged the atmosphere was at the checkpoint, or at the bus stop.
The villagers, with their misplaced resolve... were still fighting.
And this girl, even knowing the villagers' grim resolve...
 ...had already declared their victory.
The villagers, throwing themselves into this endless war, and this optimistic girl who said they had already won.
 ...That contrast was somehow strange.

<Akasaka>
"...Why do you think that?
 If you know something that makes you that confident, could you tell me?"
Rika-chan stayed silent for a while, seemingly choosing what to say...

<Rika>
"...Because."

<Akasaka>
"...Because...?"
She looked like she was lost on whether she should continue or not.
...As if she was troubled on whether it was okay for her to say it... that kind of expression.

<Rika>
"....It's already been decided.
 ...There's no other way to say it."

<Akasaka>
"I-It's already been decided, huh..."
...It really is just like a little girl to say something like that.
...I couldn't believe it was actually true.
...She was the only one saying such things with such confidence.
My real mission, that I had forgotten about during this fun-filled day, resurfaced at the back of my mind.
 ...The kidnapping of the minister's grandson...
Had the Onigafuchi Guardians kidnapped the minister's grandson and already succeeded in negotiating the cancellation of the dam project?
Did Kimiyoshi actually already know that and was just playing dumb?
...Was that what this girl was really telling me?

<Rika>
"...Akasaka."
The girl called out my name suddenly.

<Akasaka>
"...What is it?"

<Rika>
"...Go back to Tokyo."

Huh...?
I wasn't only surprised at that sudden command.
...Ever since I came to this village, I had never once mentioned I was from Tokyo.
Well... based on my accent, she might have been able to guess where I was from...
 ...What was I getting so worked up over?
...It was probably the sudden and complete change in her demeanor.

<Rika>
"...You should definitely go back to Tokyo right away.
 ...If not, you will woefully regret it."
The girl had been holding my sleeve the entire time.
She'd been tugging at my sleeve since hurriedly dragging me over to show me this wonderful view.
But this was the adorable Rika-chan, who I'd spent the entire day with.
There was no way she could have been replaced with a doppelganger when I wasn't looking.
...She had been holding onto my sleeve this entire time...
 But somehow this girl... was someone other than Rika-chan.
 She looked like Rika-chan, but she wasn't.
 ...She was some girl I had never met before.
That girl had told me in an indifferent voice...
That I would eventually... regret coming to this village from the bottom of my heart.

<Rika>
"That would be an incredibly pathetic thing to see.
 ...So I thought I'd warn you right now."

<Akasaka>
"...Why...would I come to regret it?"

<Rika>
"...Stop whining."
...I couldn't believe that I was hearing such cold words come from Rika-chan's mouth.
I just couldn't believe it.
...Was somebody impersonating her, using ventriloquism or something?
Thinking that, I wanted to take a look around but...
 ...The girl's gaze had me pinned down, making me unable to move.

<Rika>
"...When you tried crossing the road when the Don't Walk sign was up, did your parents finish explaining why it was dangerous before pulling you back to the sidewalk?
 They'd pull you back right away, wouldn't they? 

<Rika>
They'd pull you back before explaining why it was dangerous, wouldn't they?
 ...In other words, it's something like that."
The girl I had spent time with... Rika Furude... would not speak like that.
She would speak with a cuteness befitting her age, with brief, childish remarks... expressing her emotions honestly...
...She definitely wouldn't speak with such pointed words.

<Rika>
"...I've warned you.
 ...Don't get the wrong idea... it's not like I'm saying this because I hate you.
 ...You don't need to tell somebody who's better off dead that they're in danger."

<Akasaka>
"...Who... are you?
 ...You're not Rika-chan."

<Rika>
"...Hm?
 ...Tee hee hee hee hee...!"
As soon as I accused her of not being Rika-chan, she let out a strange, quiet giggle.
...It was a laugh not befitting a child of her age.
...It was like she was possessed by something...
Her change was just that total and complete.
Was Rika-chan being attacked by some terrifying phenomenon?
 ...That occult idea came to mind without any sort of hesitation.
Rika-chan is acting strange... somebody... help!
Thinking that I'd yell that, I turned to where the mayor was.
...I immediately realized he was looking at us with a smile.
That's right... to him, it looked like nothing more than me and Rika-chan fooling around.
He didn't notice that there was something terrifying happening to her.

<Rika>
"...Akasaka is such a coward.
 ...Tee hee hee hee hee...!"
The girl had obviously grasped that I was afraid.
Noticing that and calling me a coward, she laughed again.
That cackling girl, approaching me in a strange manner while still laughing... lost her balance, and fell flat on her face.
...Rika-chan fell down.
If it was just a while before, I would have extended a hand to help her up without hesitation.
...But now... extending a hand to this ominous girl who looked like Rika-chan but wasn't... required a bit more courage than I had at the moment.

<Rika>
"...Meep."
The girl cried out thus.
She then squirmed upright and dusted herself off.
...Afterwards, she looked around restlessly as a blank expression crept across her face.
...You've got to be kidding me.
 Was she making fun of me...?
That way of acting...
 ...It was as though... after being possessed by something... she had lost her memories of what happened...

<Akasaka>
"...You're joking, right...?
 ...Rika... chan...?"

<Rika>
"...Meep."
I don't know if Rika-chan had heard me or not.
 ...She just cried out like that, as if questioning herself.

<Old Woman>
"Hey, mister~!
 Rika-chama too~~!
 Tea's ready~~!
 There's some snacks too, so please come and have some~~!!"
An old lady wearing a smock was waving energetically from the entrance of the office.
Hearing that there were snacks, Rika-chan's expression changed.

<Rika>
"...Yaaaaaay."
A carefree smile.
...That was a familiar smile-- the one that belonged to the embodiment of my ideal daughter.
Any hint of the creepy girl that was just there, spouting sinister words... had vanished.

<Old Woman>
"C'mon Rika-chama~!
 Wash your hands first~~!!
 There aren't any manjuu here for dirty hands~~!"

<Rika>
"...I'll wash them real good~~!
 Meeeeep!!"
Rika-chan responded with vigor, running off to the washing station that was along the side of the office.
She stopped halfway, turning around to call to me.

<Rika>
"...If Akasaka doesn't hurry up, I'll eat his share of manjuu too. They're steaming fresh."

<Akasaka>
"Huh... ah..."

<Rika>
"People who don't wash their hands aren't allowed to eat any manjuu."
...No matter how you looked at it, that was Rika-chan.
Those words and the way she said them... no matter how you heard them, they were definitely Rika-chan's.

<Old Woman>
"C'mon now, mister~~~!
 You're the adult here, so show her how it's done~~!!"
The old lady urged me to wash my hands.
...Without any resistance, I lined up beside Rika-chan at the wash station.
Splish splash.
...I stared at Rika-chan... intent on washing her hands properly, like she had probably learned at school.

<Rika>
"...Meep...?
 ...Did I do something wrong...?"

<Akasaka>
"...Huh... by wrong... you mean..."

<Rika>
"How I'm washing my hands.
 ...I only got 4 gold stickers for it.
 ...I'm probably bad at washing my hands."

<Akasaka>
"Y-You're not doing anything wrong.
 If you're washing them that carefully, that's more than enough..."

<Rika>
"...But it's not, Akasaka.
 If you don't use a brush and clean out the dirt underneath your fingernails, you won't get a gold sticker."

<Akasaka>
"Um... hmmm.
 ...Rika-chan, you're very diligent... that's something to be proud of..."

<Rika>
"...Nipah~~~☆. I was praised by Akasaka."
No matter how you looked at it... it was Rika-chan.
 ...There was no trace of that girl from before.
Exactly what was that sinister girl...?

<Akasaka>
"...Rika-chan... what was the meaning of what just happened now?"

<Rika>
"..."

<Akasaka>
"...Just now, you told me... to go back to Tokyo... didn't you?"

<Rika>
"...Did I say that?"

<Akasaka>
"..."
...I was at a loss for words.
...She didn't remember what that girl just now had said.
Like I would ever believe something as occult as that could happen...
Like I would ever believe that Rika-chan could be possessed by that strange girl and say those creepy things...

<Akasaka>
"...Rika-chan... you definitely said that."

<Rika>
"...Meep..."
Her expression told me that...
 despite my saying so, she had no idea...
...She wasn't playing dumb... she actually... didn't know.
...Exactly... what was that just now...
Just as Rika-chan had... I let a look of confusion creep across my face.
...The two of us, both looking like we had no idea what was going on, must have certainly been a humorous sight to behold.
While partaking of tea and snacks, I was shown a propaganda film shot by the Guardians that highlighted their resistance efforts.
Older folks talked passionately on how long and grueling the fight against the dam was, but they fell on deaf ears.
...I was transfixed by Rika-chan, who had heard these stories countless times before, and was nodding off.
Eventually Rika-chan noticed I was staring at her, and smiled as she rubbed her eyes.
...That smile was Rika-chan's, after all... there was no hint of that sinister shadow.
...After that, my unreasonable fear of Rika-chan lessened with the passing of time... but I could by no means forget what had happened.
It eventually grew dark. The mayor said that they had prepared dinner, but I said I would come again tomorrow and took my leave.
...I had to return to the hotel and file my regular report with the section chief.

<Makino>
"I see.
 ...Well then, please come again tomorrow!
 If you phone, we'll send somebody to pick you up right away."

<Akasaka>
"I appreciate your hospitality.
 I'll probably come again and enjoy myself tomorrow."

<Makino>
"Yes, please do!
 It seems that Rika-chama has taken a pretty big liking to you!"

<Rika>
"...Akasaka, are you coming again tomorrow?
 I finish after fifth period, so if you could come at around three o'clock, that would make me happy."
...Please come again.
 That pure smile urged me to do so.
...There wasn't a trace of that evil aura.
...Depending on what happened next... all that might end up as nothing other than my hallucination...
Thinking about it logically...
...If the daughter of the Furude household, one of the Three Families, had taken a liking to me... then this was a strong foothold for my investigation from here on out. 
It was like a free ticket for a reason to visit Hinamizawa.
If only I could treat that little incident as a figment of my imagination... then having this girl who was the embodiment of my ideal daughter grow so attached to me... wasn't bad either...
I had successfully dove into the belly of the Onigafuchi Guardians, and had the mayor as well as other important members of the Alliance welcome me with open arms.
 ...This was a great turn of events.
However... I still felt uneasy.
...Getting back to the hotel, I forced down an almost painfully cold beer until I could clear my mind.
 The shock from that incomprehensibly strange incident continued to torment me...



[Himatsubushi Ch.4]

The phone suddenly rang.
I woke up in a hurry.
...The clock read 9 p.m..

<Akasaka>
"...Dammit...!!
 I slept past the time I was supposed to report in..."
I picked up the receiver.

<Front Desk>
"Akasaka-sama.
 You have a call from an outside line, shall I connect you?
 It's from a coworker named Kanou-sama."
...I knew it.
 ...I didn't call in, so they had phoned me.

<Akasaka>
"...Sorry, please put them through."

<Front Desk>
"Understood.
 I'll connect you, so please hang up the receiver for the time being."
After I had put down the receiver for a few seconds, the phone began to ring again.

<Akasaka>
"Yes, hello?
 This is Akasaka...!"

<Kanou>
"Akasaka-kun?
 This is Kanou.
 Good work out there.
 You didn't call in for your regular report, so we called instead.
 What's your situation?"
...Leaving the lecture for later, my senior coworker got straight to the point.

<Akasaka>
"Today I went to the village proper.
 Under the guise of a tourist, I managed to establish contact with the mayor and several other core members of the Guardians. 

<Akasaka>
I wasn't able to ask them anything, but I left a good impression and was able to make a bridge for my investigation from tomorrow onwards."

<Kanou>
"I see.
 It looks like things are going smoothly.
 Akasaka-kun, you seem rather naive sometimes, but that might have worked in your favor.
 I guess you made some good progress for now?"

<Akasaka>
"...I don't have the experience to make a comparison, so I don't know if it's that good or not.
 ...I think things went well for today, though."

<Kanou>
"Did you find out anything from the prefectural or local offices?
 Does it look as though the Onigafuchi Guardians is unrelated to this incident?"
I still didn't know.
...I should have been able to say that immediately.
 ...I only had to say that, but for some reason...
 I hesitated.

<Akasaka>
"...I'm still investigating, so I don't know what to say yet."

<Kanou>
"I see.
 Could you let us know as soon as possible?
 I think you understand, but after tonight, it'll have been a full four days since the kidnapping happened. 

<Kanou>
...They didn't set a time limit, but it's obvious that time is not on our side.
 ...I think you know that."

<Akasaka>
"Yeah.
 I know.
 I'll investigate a little quicker, while still being careful about it."

<Kanou>
"Okay.
 Be sure to look after yourself.
 You're dealing with a violent organization here.
 ...It might be dangerous to let your guard down.
 If you feel that you're in any danger, contact me immediately. 

<Kanou>
In that case, I can get the local Public Safety Office prepared to help you."

<Akasaka>
"Thank you.
 I'll do my best."

<Kanou>
"...Anything else to report?"
I reported several bits of supplementary information... and at the very end, I decided to ask.

<Akasaka>
"...How's the investigation going on your end?"

<Kanou>
"Hm.
 Everybody's doing their best here, but we're not making much progress.
 After all, the number of organizations we're investigating is vast. 

<Kanou>
So, if you find out the one you're investigating is in the clear, we'll have you return to Tokyo to assist some of the other officers. 

<Kanou>
...The Chief is saying to dig up what you can on Onigafuchi, but I don't think a residential anti-dam protest group has any relation to the incident at hand. 

<Kanou>
Sending somebody out just to investigate a single group makes me cringe, really."
At this point he was just complaining.
...He was telling me to stop taking time enjoying my trip. To finish up and get back quick.

<Akasaka>
"I'll try and resolve this as soon as I can."

<Kanou>
"Thanks. I'm counting on you!
 Well then, if there's nothing else, I'm hanging up."

<Akasaka>
"Okay.
 That's all I have."
As we were ending our call, he scolded me thoroughly for being late with my regular report.
After that, I hung up the phone and sprawled out on the bed.

...Come to think of it, I hadn't heard anything from Ooishi.
He was supposed to contact me about a time and place to meet with the informant tonight.
...I thought about getting angry with Ooishi in retaliation for being scolded for forgetting my daily report...
Come to think of it, though, Ooishi didn't really say anything other than that he was going to call tonight.
...Waiting for a phone call when you didn't know what time it was going to come was in itself rather difficult.
Just when I thought that, the phone rang.
 I picked up the receiver in a hurry.

<Akasaka>
"H-Hello?"

<Ooishi>
"Well, this is a surprise.
 ...Akasaka-san, you're pretty quick to answer the phone.
 You could quit the force and easily make a living in sales for some large corporation."

<Akasaka>
"I've never so much as considered quitting the force...!"

<Ooishi>
"The way you overreact is rather... interesting.
 Na ha ha ha!
 That's no good, it doesn't pay to be a cop and it's not too late to reconsider.
 Nfu fu fu!"

<Akasaka>
dialog000"...I'll pass, so could you please get to the point, Ooishi-san?"

<Ooishi>
"Really?
 Too bad, we'll leave the retirement conversation for next time, then.
dialog003 ...Well, I'll get to the point."
Many of the executives in the Onigafuchi Guardians had a lot of sway in the neighboring regions.
Even in Okinomiya, there were a lot of people with relations in the village.
...That's why meeting in the Shishibone Market District, far from Okinomiya, was a matter of course.

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san, over here!
 Did you get a little lost?
 Coming from the north entrance might have been a bit of a detour, but it was easier to give directions from there."

<Akasaka>
"No, I'm sorry for being late."

<Ooishi>
"Did you eat dinner already?"

<Akasaka>
"Yeah.
 I already did."

<Ooishi>
"Well then, shall we go to a place where we can get a drink?
 Do you prefer western alcohol?
 Or maybe sake?
 Would you prefer a place with or without women?
 Mfu fu fu fu!"

<Akasaka>
"Don't worry about it.
 I don't drink while I'm on the job."
Hearing that, the man that Ooishi had brought along bent backwards as he guffawed, clapping Ooishi on the shoulder.

<Ooishi>
"See?
 Isn't he just adorable?
 In exchange, can you give him a bit extra?
 That money all came from this guy's wallet, you know."
The man that Ooishi had brought seemed almost like a ticket scalper or a bookie. Even his appearance was dubious.
The informant grinned deviously.

<Sato>
"Hey boy.
 How much did you give this guy?
 It looks like there was quite a bit skimmed off the top, you know."

<Akasaka>
"Ooishi's handling fee was included, so I took that into account."
It seemed that the informant had expected a more extravagant reaction on my part.
...When I responded matter-of-factly, he realized that I was an entirely different type of person than he was.
But rather than putting a distance between us, it seemed that I had piqued his interest...

<Ooishi>
"I said it, didn't I?
 He's the serious type.
 But do you see, Akasaka-san?
 People in a line of work like ours can really use their wealth of experience to their advantage."

<Akasaka>
"I'm wondering exactly how the experience of drinking in a bar with women would work to my advantage..."

<Sato>
"Waa hahaha haaa ha ha!!"
The informant, unable to contain himself, clutched at his stomach as he guffawed, heedless of the people watching.

<Ooishi>
"Oh lawdie!
 Akasaka-san, you really can judge people!
 That's what an education does for you!"

<Akasaka>
"...Ooishi-san?
 You've been drinking somewhere, haven't you!
 Are you drunk!?"

<Ooishi>
"What's wrong with drinking when I'm off-duty~!
 Even if you're working, I'm not.
 Heh heh heh heh heh~!"
Ooishi, who was the sort that'd fool around to begin with, was in such a good mood I couldn't figure out a way to deal with him.
...Completely different than me, who had come worried about getting every bit of information I could.
...Ooishi-san.
After taking so much money, you were supposed to get me information worth at least as much...
I thought this, but then realized that I was getting my information from the informant, so it didn't matter how drunk Ooishi was.
...It was nothing I could complain about, but I still felt slightly riled up.
Ooishi and the informant (it was no doubt a fake name, but he introduced himself as Sato) led the way deeper and deeper into the back streets of the market district.
Even though the market was bustling, a couple of turns off the main street and you were in a desolate alleyway.
Ooishi started climbing a set of stairs on the side of a seedy building.
There wasn't any sort of signage, so I couldn't tell if the place was open, or if it was even a store at all.

<Ooishi>
"...Don't worry.
 This isn't a dubious place.
 Nfu fu fu fu!"
Those words, coming from Ooishi's mouth, had absolutely no credibility...
Beyond the door... was thankfully, a typical mahjong parlor.
I was relieved that it wasn't the sort of suspicious place I had to be on my guard about...

<Salesperson>
"Welcome, welcome~.
 Oh, Ooishi-san, it's been a while!
 Want to join in?
 There'll be a free spot soon."

<Ooishi>
"No, no, I'm here with a group today, so it's fine.
 Oh, sorry to keep you waiting."
Mahjong is a game played with four people.
 ...It seems that a middle-aged man who was going to be our fourth had already arrived and was waiting for us.

<Old Man>
"You're late, Kuraudo.
 I was just thinking of going home!"
Ooishi made an excuse for why we had taken so long.
...Eventually, realizing that I was a new face, the other man grew interested.

<Ooishi>
"That's Akasaka-san.
 He's a rookie who came all the way from Tokyo on assignment. They have high hopes for him."

<Sato>
"...Boy.
 Can you play mahjong?"

<Akasaka>
"W-Well... I played a bit when I was still a student."
Sato and the old man cackled in unison.
 ...Their plot to sucker me out of my money was painfully obvious...

<Ooishi>
"I thought you'd be a bit tired from your assignment leaving you on edge all the time!
 So I thought I'd give you a night to cleanse your spirit.
 Mfu fu!"

<Akasaka>
"...I know asking this now might be stupid... but we're all police, aren't we...?"

<Old Man>
dialog004"""GA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!"""

<Ooishi>
"Well~, let's not talk about that.
 Loosen up a bit, we won't actually gamble anything.
 We're just deciding whose going to pay for everyone to go play at a very ni~ce place afterward~~!
 Mfu fu fu fu fu~~!!!"

<Akasaka>
dialog005"...Go play?
 At what kind of place would you be doing that?"
Without reservation, the three of them started suggesting places like cabarets, high-class clubs, and even brothels.
...At the very least, they were the type of places that you couldn't go to with money that was just 'for funsies.'

<Akasaka>
"...Ooishi-san took all my money the other day, and I also have work to do, so I can't stay for long..."

<Old Man>
dialog006"Then all you have to do is win!
 If you win, then you won't have to pay for this table, and you can talk to Kuraudo about work or whatever."
dialog007...No matter what happened, it seemed like they were intent on playing mahjong for free...
...I would have to fasten my resolve a bit.
If I was going to be underestimated like this forever it was going to get in the way of my work.

<Akasaka>
"...I understand.
 Then, I'll play with you guys for just a bit.
 If I win, you guys don't get to go out playing, and we talk about work right away."

<Old Man>
dialog008"""GA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!"""

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, yeah!!
 Bring it on!
 Mfu fu fu!"

<Old Man>
"If I win, we're headed straight to the Blue Mermaid on Flower Road!!"

<Ooishi>
"This ol' lech here likes that place too~!!
 Of course, we're going to hop between all the favorite places! 
dialog009 Akemi-chaaaan!!!
 Mua ha ha ha !!
 What about you, Sato-san?"

<Sato>
"I'd prefer a place where we can drink 'quietly.'"

<Ooishi>
"Like a nice quiet place with a bunny girl?
dialog010 Muahahahahahaha!! 

<Ooishi>
The last time we went drinking, you pulled the tail right off that bunny girl, didn't you?
 Didn't you end up having to pay for that?"

<Sato>
"The owner started a bottle of Dom Perignon on my tab and called it a 'tailoring fee.'"

<Sato>
dialog011""Wa ha ha ha ha ha!!""
...What a lively table this was.
...I could tell the other customers were glaring at us while we loudly continued our crude conversation...
...Speaking of which, the fact that they assumed I was the same was a bit disheartening...
...Ooishi had taken all the money I'd brought, so everything I had left was out of my own pocket.
 ...In addition, there wasn't that much left of that, either.
...If I kept on hanging around him like this, through his goading, my wallet would disappear into the night.
...I had to somehow win and return the conversation to my job.
...But these people, no matter how you looked at it, were pretty good...
 ...Sorry,
 Yukie.

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha!
 Well then, I'll just call riichi here!"
...Well, the ol' man and Sato-san probably won't fall for this silly riichi.
 I wonder if Akasaka-kun will spit out what I need, mfu fu fu!

<Old Man>
"At any rate, Kuraudo's hand is probably holding something like that, huh?
 In that case, this one oughta' go through.
 There!"

Oh-ho!
 The ol' man's pretty good.
 He's quietly trying to use one of my safe tiles to complete his hand, isn't he?
It seems that Akasaka-kun has at least learned the ropes when it comes to guarding against someone's riichi.
 ...But that will be his downfall!

<Old Man>
"...What's wrong, boy?
 Would you hurry up and discard?
 If you're not sure, anything that Kuraudo's already thrown away should be safe, no?"

<Akasaka>
"..."
Oooh, Akasaka-kun's really fretting over this one~!
It was glaringly obvious that he had a safe tile to discard, but he didn't want to throw it away because it would move him farther from completing his hand.
 Mmmm, they're so nice when they're young and innocent☆.
Come on, hurry up and throw out the kicker~!
If he gave me the winning tile, we'd be headed to an establishment where I could do with all sorts of licking and sucking!
If he gives the ol' man his winning tile, we'd be headed straight to the place with maids in bloomers~~!!

<Akasaka>
"...This... will go through, right?"
He looked up as he hesitantly threw out a tile that was...
 ...Oh, too bad.

<Old Man>
"Hey now, that's a dangerous tile, you know!
 Kuraudo, does that go through!?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, it will!
 Mfu fu fu!"
It seems this time you were lucky.
But as long as the round kept going, I could still win off the draw!!
 Nfu fu fu!
But after that, Akasaka-kun managed to luckily avoid throwing any bad tiles, and somehow the round managed to end without anybody completing a hand.

<Ooishi>
"Tenpai."


<Old Man>
 "Tenpai."


<Sato>
 "Noten."

Sato-san had keenly anticipated that two players were in riichi and had decided to play it safe.
What a cool-headed way of playing.
Now let's see, what kind of hand did Akasaka-kun have?
When the round ends with nobody winning in mahjong, anybody in tenpai has to show their hand.
But if you're not in tenpai, you have no obligation to reveal it.
...Your average beginner would normally show their hand even if they weren't in tenpai, and start a commotion about how if this tile or that tile came they would be in tenpai.
 But he didn't.
 ...Being stingy?

<Sato>
"How'd you do, boy?
 C'mon and show me!"
Sato-san reached over to flip the hand that Akasaka-kun had casually placed face down.

<Sato>
"Hmmm~~...??
 What the hell is this...?"
He was nowhere near tenpai.
 ...Was Akasaka-kun totally bad at this after all?
 Mfu fu fu...?
Right then, as the ol' man compared the tiles from Akasaka-kun's hand to the discard pool, a puzzled expression crossed his face.

<Old Man>
"...Boy.
 You were in tenpai right around here, weren't you?
 Why'd you break your hand?"

<Akasaka>
"...The higher manzu tiles suddenly got more valuable, so I held them back.
 Even though the chance they were safe tiles had increased with respect to Ooishi-san's riichi. 

<Akasaka>
It would have been safer to read the discards, but there was a player who went out of their way to keep the tiles out of play."

<Old Man>
"...Oh?
 ...So Kuraudo's tenpai was no good from the start, in other words."

<Akasaka>
"...If it wasn't such a high-level trap, I would have thought that you were waiting for me to throw out the winning tile.
 But, the more concerning thing is that you were in tenpai and didn't say anything."

<Old Man>
"When did you realize I was in tenpai?"

<Akasaka>
"....Around here?
 You threw out 4 tiles in a row immediately.
 At first I thought you were just discarding redundant tiles, but I noticed you glancing over at me, and realized you were waiting for something."
...Akasaka-kun... you...

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san, when did you first start playing mahjong?"

<Akasaka>
"I never did, except in high school and university.
 Now, let's continue.
 Since Sato-san wasn't in tenpai and the round ended without a winner, then I'm next, right?
 ...The next dealer."
...It seems like Akasaka-kun is really aware of how the game flows...
We'd thought we were just going to eat him alive... but it looks like that isn't going to be so easy...

<Akasaka>
"...Ooishi-san, looks like you're going for the bamboo tiles.
 Should I put some in play?"

<Old Man>
"...Tch.
 ..This boy...!
 Kuraudo, don't back down!!"

<Ooishi>
"As long as I get 3 more good tiles...!
 Sato-san, think you can do it?"

<Sato>
"Dammit...!
 I'll just force you to go for a cheap tanyao!
 Chi!"

<Akasaka>
"A straight?
 Well, sorry, I'm going to pon that tile."
...Whoa now, going to call three-of-a-kind after he declared a straight?
 ...Trying to override and interfere!?

<Old Man>
"...Boy, you're getting pretty used to this...!"

<Akasaka>
"Oh no.
 ...I couldn't even compare to you guys, who have been playing since before I was even born.
 ...That's game.
 Ron.

 Triplets,
 2 red dora,
 and three more dora.
 

<Akasaka>
 ...I'm the dealer, so this'll cost you quite a bit."

<Old Man>
"...Gah!"

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha ha ha!!
 Akasaka-san, nice job!!
 Now we'll have to get serious!
 Won't we!?"

<Akasaka>
"Well, can you get serious about handing over your points?
 ...I'm tired, so let's end this quickly."
...Akasaka-kun?
...This is somehow unreal...
 Nahahahaha...
Before I could realize it, there was an ominous cold air emitting from beneath Akasaka-kun's feet.

<Akasaka>
"...How blasé.
 The 2, 5, and 8 manzus are laughing at you."

<Sato>
"D-Dammit!!
 Boy, you--!!"

<Old Man>
"...Kuraudo, finish it!
 You have to end the boy's turn as dealer!"

<Ooishi>
"...I hate to admit it, but that seems like the best option..."

<Sato>
"There it is!
 Ron!
 Simple straights, one dora!!"

<Akasaka>
"Sorry, headbump.
 ...Ron.

 Straight."

<Sato>
"...A headbump!?
 You damn brat!!"

<Akasaka>
"Brat?
 So you'd play that sloppily against a brat?
 ...Guess that means you're worse than a brat yourself.
 ...It's so interesting.
 The way you guys call people things like 'brat' and 'boy.'
 Heh heh heh...!"

<Ooishi>
"A-Akasaka-kun?
 That is you, isn't it?
 It feels like you're a totally different person..."

<Akasaka>
"....You thought that I, being a sucker, would let you drink some good booze tonight.
 Seems that you were a little off the mark.
 Ron.
 Triple straight, red dora, and another dora."

<Sato>
"...Whoa!!
 He actually did it!!"

<Akasaka>
"That's why I'm saying you guys are slacking.
 ...No matter how you look at it, you have to be able to read such an obvious three-way wait."
Akasaka-kun chuckled as he rested his chin in his hands.
...That pose was so fitting it was almost scary.

<Old Man>
"...Hey, Kuraudo!
 This isn't what we discussed!
 Who the hell said he was a naive sucker ripe for the picking!?"

<Ooishi>
"Ah... na ha ha ha...!!
 Who could it be?"

<Sato>
"...Ooishi-san, this is bad.
 If he keeps going like this, we're seriously going to lose!"
...Akasaka-kun.
 ...For you to make me get serious.
...Looks like you really want to be milked dry...

<Akasaka>
"Pon.
 ...Pon.
 ...That sounds nice, one more time! Pon."
Akasaka-kun was almost singing at this point.
...The tiles he had open were all pin tiles.
...You can't be serious... are you really going for the flush!?

<Akasaka>
"...Pon."

<Sato>
"...Boy... are you right in the head...?
 You've opened four sets.... you only have one tile left, you know."

<Akasaka>
"That's right.
 ...Did you know?
 Waiting on a single tile is the hardest thing to read."

<Sato>
"A-are you an idiot!?
 With that much of your hand revealed, you don't think we'd give you a tile you need, do you!?"

<Ooishi>
"....Nfu fu fu!
 ...I know what you're doing, Akasaka-san.
 ...That's not a flush or a half-flush, is it?"


<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"The fact that you called Pon four times means you're already in position for an all-triplet hand.
 ...Right now, you're far and away in the lead. 

<Ooishi>
...You're trying to show a flush and goad us into giving you triplets, aren't you?"

<Akasaka>
"...If that's what you think,
 want to try throwing out some pins?
 The left five tiles in your hand, Ooishi-san.
 They're pin tiles you're reluctant to throw away, aren't they? 

<Akasaka>
Why don't you try discarding them in order from the left?"
...You must be joking...
Is he a mahjong god...?
 If not, he had to be the main character of a manga or something!!
At that moment, the ol' man sent me a sign under the table.
 The message was simple and clear.

<Old Man>
(...Kuraudo.
 ...Do it. Crush him.)

<Ooishi>
(...I don't like to cheat against kids like this.)

<Old Man>
(Idiot!
 After being disrespected like this we can't pull back now!)

<Ooishi>
(...Well, I'm not responsible for what happens, you know?
 Go ahead.)

<Old Man>
"Here we go, boy!
 Riichi!!
 We'll go open!
 I'm waiting for a 1, 4, or 7 of pins!"

<Akasaka>
"..."
Most likely, the tile that Akasaka-kun was waiting for was one of those tiles.
...With this, Akasaka-kun was no longer capable of winning the hand.
...When I drew from the wall... I switched out the tile that Akasaka-kun would draw.
...The tile that I put in was the 1 pin.
One of the tiles that the ol' man was waiting on.
Akasaka-kun discarded it a little while ago, so there was no threat of it being the one he needed...

<Sato>
"...Come on, it's your turn, boy."

<Akasaka>
".....Hm."
I knew he was troubled that the tile he drew was the 1 pin.
 ...Of course, he couldn't discard it.

<Old Man>
"Boy.
 You must be aware, but... if you discard into an open riichi, it's worth the limit, you know?"

<Akasaka>
"You don't have to tell me that."
The tile that came from Akasaka-kun's hand was,
 ...an honor tile!
Whew!! Ain't that something!
There's only one North wind tile left, isn't there?
 You were counting on a really rough wait, weren't you!!
But... with this, Akasaka-kun's fate was decided.

<Old Man>
"....Heh heh, brat.
 ...You're lucky you're safe.
 ...But your hand only has a single tile.
 You think you'll be able to run away the rest of this round...?
 Heh heh..."

<Akasaka>
"...So, it's going to be like that."
Akasaka-kun glared at the ol' man with a discerning eye.
...This guy had pretty good instincts.
 Did he figure out we were cheating!?

<Ooishi>
(...Let's stop this.
 Akasaka-kun is a step or two ahead of us.)

<Old Man>
(Fool!
 You think we can stop after we've come this far?
 Next!
 Make him draw it!!)
...The next tile Akasaka-kun would draw was the seven pin.
...With that, it would be settled.
 No matter which one he discarded, he'd play right into the ol' man's hand.
...An unavoidable full payout!!

When I drew my tile... I sneakily swapped Akasaka-san's---

<Akasaka>
"Achoo!!!"

*Crash*
...What!?
...Akasaka-kun suddenly sneezed, collapsing the wall of tiles in front of him!!

<Old Man>
"H-....Hey, what are you doing..."

<Akasaka>
"Sorry, I accidentally knocked over the wall when I sneezed.
 ...There's a penalty for that, right?
 I'm the dealer, so four thousand to everybody?
 Or should I pay a deposit?"

<Ooishi>
"...Wa ha ha ha ha ha!!!"
Unable to hold back, I guffawed.
Akasaka-kun, knowing he was going to be cornered a second time and unable to escape...
He took the drastic measure of knocking over his own wall!

<Old Man>
"...You're good, boy...!!
 To get away from a full payout like that!!
 Ga ha ha ha ha ha!!!"

<Akasaka>
"...Ooishi-san, could you not bother putting me in such an obvious trap?
 ...If we were at Baba, this would have been the point where I flipped the table..."

<Ooishi>
"Oh no no no no, sorry, sorry!
 I underestimated you!
 For some reason, you're really good, aren't you!"

<Old Man>
"Answer me honestly.
 You got a lot of experience when you were younger, didn't you?"

<Akasaka>
"I played quite a bit around Waseda and Takadanobaba.
 The place I frequented banned me for winning too much. 

<Akasaka>
dialog012...I made the woman who would become my wife pretty angry, so I washed my hands of it all."

<Sato>
"Raised the stakes too high?
 How much were you playing for at the time?"

<Akasaka>
"It depends on who I was playing with, but I had an almost perfect record playing in Kabukicho.
 Especially since when I played against a certain crowd, my life was on the line."
dialog01320 times!?!?

What kind of stakes were those?
 Did you have yakuza at your table?
 Or pro baseball players!?

<Old Man>
"...What's this!?
 Kuraudo!!
 You buffoon!!
 Where did you pull this guy from? He's practically a professional!!
dialog014 I give up!!
 Geez!!
 Boy, it's your win!
 I surrender!!"

<Akasaka>
"Thank you very much, it was an honor."

<Ooishi>
"...Na ha ha ha...
 Oh my.
 ...Akasaka-san, your personality really changes when you play~!
 Why do you even have a day job!
 You'd have no problem living as a freelancer!"

<Akasaka>
"To be a pro mahjong player, you need both talent and luck.
 I didn't have anything like that supporting me."

<Sato>
"...Luck is luck.
 With somebody of your skill, I'd think you'd be able to make it pretty far."

<Akasaka>
"Normal luck doesn't cut it.
 Calling a Kan and one time out of three, you can aim to win on the extra draw with four dora.
 That kind of luck."

<Ooishi>
"....Akasaka-kun, if you can judge something like that, you're already bordering on the supernatural..."

<Akasaka>
"No, there's plenty of people who can do that without cheating or superpowers.

<Akasaka>
There was a person I met in Shinjuku who would get doras every time you blinked... he was as strong as a demon. 

<Akasaka>
There was a pro I played with in Yokohama, who would draw the tile he needed immediately after calling Riichi like it was an everyday thing.
 I don't have that kind of luck."
...What type of folks were those...
 They weren't named Ryuu or Satoshi by any chance...?

<Akasaka>
"Well then, is it alright if I'm declared the overall winner, then?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah yeah~!
 We totally lost!
 Mfu fu fu~!"

<Old Man>
"I lost, I lost!
 It's been a while since I lost this big!!"

<Sato>
"Still, when you were playing, boy, you were pretty into it.
 It was kind of scary..."

<Akasaka>
"I hear that a lot.
 ...I don't mean to change gears like that, though.
 Did I really look that scary...?"

<Old Man>
"""Yup."""
The three of us nodded emphatically in agreement.
...So that was Akasaka-kun, the mahjong prodigy.
...Before he goes home from his assignment, maybe I could have him go play at a high-stakes table in my place!
...But it's not good to get greedy.
 Nfu fu!

<Ooishi>
"...Well then, nothing for it.
 It was a promise.
 We'll break up our little late-night study group right now.
 Sorry about this, ol' man.
 That's it for tonight."

<Old Man>
"Nothing you could do.
 I'm going home to sleep!
 My body won't last like this!"

<Akasaka>
"Problems at work?"

<Ooishi>
"Oh, he's the foreman of the primary construction site at the Hinamizawa Dam.
 He's butting heads with the residents every day.
 It's a rough business."

<Old Man>
"...Around next year, I might be in charge of the second site as well.
 I heard that Kuroda-san was pissing blood.
 He won't hold out much longer."

<Ooishi>
"You'll be alright, ol' man.
 Your skull is thicker than it looks.
 Nfu fu fu!"

<Old Man>
"I'm not exactly a saint, you know!
 There's times that just make my blood boil.
 I especially can't stand dealing with that bratty daughter of Sonozaki's!
 I think one of these days I'm going to rearrange her face."

<Ooishi>
"Now now now!
 At least the pay is good, right?
 I heard the wages were pretty exorbitant."

<Old Man>
"Of course they are!
 If the pay was cheap, nobody would hang around that god-awful job!
 Hey Kuraudo, exactly when are the police going to tell all the villagers to shove off? 

<Old Man>
There'll be a notice of eviction from the government, right!?"

<Ooishi>
"...Hmmm... Maybe? I wonder what will happen."
The old man, who identified himself as the foreman of the Hinamizawa Dam, spewed a few complaints until he felt better about it, then left quietly.

<Ooishi>
"Well then, let's go.
 ...I'll leave the rest to Sato-san."

<Akasaka>
"...Ooishi-san, are you going home?"

<Ooishi>
"If I'm here, I'll just be in the way, won't I?
 Besides, the one who bought Sato-san's services was you.
 I didn't pay for my share."
Ooishi-san was kind of sketchy, but he was strangely conscientious about some things.
...I felt quite a bit of a gap between myself and Ooishi's generation from that part of him I didn't comprehend.

<Sato>
"Then, boy.
 ...No, I can't call Mr. Mahjong here 'boy' no more.
 Is 'Akasaka-kun' all right with you?"

<Akasaka>
"Yes."

<Sato>
"Then, Akasaka-kun.
 Shall we go?"

<Ooishi>
"Well then, Akasaka-san.
 Later.
 ...If you're having any trouble, you can count on me any time."

<Akasaka>
"I don't have any more money to pay you, you know that?"

<Ooishi>
"'kay. If you go easy on me the next time, we'll be even.
 Na ha ha ha!"
Ooishi, seemingly still not having had his fill of playing around, but without overstaying his welcome, disappeared into the night.
The informant, named Sato-san, had me get into his car before he set off.
He favored narrow roads and made numerous short left turns.

<Akasaka>
"...Checking if we're being followed?"

<Sato>
"Yeah... you know a lot about this."
Checking to see if you were being tailed by making left turns was a rather classic technique.
 If it was just a single pursuer, you could confirm it that way.
...But if you were being tailed as a team, this archaic method wouldn't let you shake them.
 ...Of course, doing it anyway was better than not.

<Sato>
"...I didn't hear anything from the boss as to who you are, Akasaka-kun.
 ...Related to the police? 

<Sato>
If you're familiar with checking for being tailed, the only other possibility I can think of is something like a private detective."

<Akasaka>
"If it's not something I have to say, I'd like to refuse to answer that question."

<Sato>
"My my...
 Ever since we played mahjong, you seem a lot more mature!
 I wonder where that hesitant person went, from when we first met."
I smiled wryly.
...Looking back now, I had to be a little grateful for being made to play mahjong.
Thanks to that I was able to relieve some tension.
Eventually Sato-san, confirming that there were no cars following us, slipped outside the city.
We were on a pitch-black country road, unable to see anything besides the lights outside...
...The only things I was able to hear were the hum of the car's air-conditioning, and the chirping of insects and frogs.

<Sato>
"...I heard from the boss that you want to hear a bit about Hinamizawa Village, yeah?"

<Akasaka>
"Like about the old houses known as the 'Three Families' who control the place, or that right now it's pretty much the Sonozaki family running things?"

<Sato>
"...If you know that much already, I'll cut out the introductions."

<Akasaka>
"Then, if you would.
 ...Can you confirm or deny if the Onigafuchi Guardians is involved with the kidnapping of Minister Inukai's grandson?"
Sato-san checked the rearview mirror one more time to confirm there wasn't anybody behind us before speaking.

<Sato>
"...Last night, the Sonozaki main house held a family council.
 Did you hear about it from the boss?"

<Akasaka>
"No."

<Sato>
"If it was a normal meeting, then it would just be all the relatives coming together over a nice cup of tea or something.
 But, a family council held by the main house isn't quite so relaxed."
A family council held by the Sonozaki main house.
...That would be a meeting between those who truly controlled Hinamizawa Village.
They wouldn't be talking about private family matters... it would be about the village as a whole.
About organizing activities against the dam project.
 Among other things... everything would be decided there. In reality, they were deciding the fate of the village.
At the head of the meeting was Oryou Sonozaki.
...More or less called 'Empress Sonozaki,' as the ultimate decision-maker of the clan she was to be feared and respected.
...Infirm with old age, she was often unable to stand on her own, but her words carried enough weight to sway the fate of the village.
It seemed that lately she had grown weak, and on days where she wasn't feeling well, remained bedridden.
Family councils that occurred while she wasn't feeling well took place with her on the floor.
In the middle of a dignified Japanese-style room, still in a futon, only the upper half of her body sitting upright, a stern look on her face... that was Oryou Sonozaki...
Sitting next to her was her heir, Mion Sonozaki.
She was still young... no, young wasn't quite the right word.
 She was a girl who remained childish.
Her role was to merely sit beside Oryou Sonozaki, sometimes responding to her requests... however...
She was the only one deemed worthy to succeed Oryou.
She had the same hawkish eyes, enough to give pause to anybody who so much as looked at them... Much was expected of her in the future... this granddaughter of the Sonozaki's leader.
And, also on either side of her, sat several other important members of the remaining Three Families: the Kimiyoshi family, and the Furude family.
First on the list for the Kimiyoshi family was of course the mayor of Hinamizawa Village, Kiichiro Kimiyoshi.
...And lined up beside him were several more of his direct relatives.
Opposite to them sat the other of the Three Families, the Furude family.
The Furude family was only comprised of the family of a Shinto priest, so the only ones sitting there were said priest, his wife, and their daughter Rika.
Rika was doted on by many of the older folks in the village, and it seemed that Oryou was no exception.
While the stress from just attending a family council was said to be enough to shorten your lifespan by three days, it seemed like Rika was the only one exempt from that.
No matter how charged the atmosphere was around her, she paid it no mind, instead humming along as she doodled in a sketchbook.
In fact, the night before, lying on her stomach while humming and doodling, she nonchalantly tucked her legs into Oryou's futon like it was a kotatsu.
All this was the Three Families.
...And all around the room, lined row-upon-row, were relatives of the Sonozaki family.
The only ones who were afforded cushions to sit on were direct relatives.
 The others were left to sit in the seiza position directly on the tatami mats.
With Empress Sonozaki enshrined at their center, they were almost like a giant snake coiled around the room.
It was decided that everybody would sit in order of their rank...
The number of people from the Sonozaki family was overwhelming.
The fact that the Sonozaki family held so many seats at a meeting where everything pertaining to the village was decided made determining where the balance of power was held in the Three Families as clear as day.
The number of members in attendance from each of the families directly reflected how much influence they had in ruling Hinamizawa.

<Akasaka>
"...What was talked about... at that meeting?"
Sato-san, after remaining silent for a while, quietly began to speak...

<Kiichiro>
"...Wasn't our monetary gift of appreciation to the media a little large?"
Breaking the long moment of silence was the head of the Kimiyoshi family, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi...
The Onigafuchi Guardians wasn't a business.
...They were nothing more than a private organization pushing for the cancellation of the Hinamizawa Dam Project, with no reliable source of income.
Fundraising had always been a problem.
When they first started operating, they had managed to collect a sizable amount of funds through donations, but as the conflict dragged on, that amount was steadily declining.

<Man>
"...This isn't an era where you can get what you want just by throwing rocks.
 It's very important you don't underestimate the power of the media, and we want to borrow some of that down the road."
The expressions of the people related to the Sonozaki family were sullen.
...As the one who suggested that they should borrow that power was the family head, Oryou Sonozaki.
The battle wasn't just about force of arms.
In this civilized age, there were civilized methods of fighting.
...Oryou suggested that, creating a strategy incorporating the mass media.
Oryou's foresight was spot on... and the effects of that plan, while at first unclear, slowly began to manifest.
If the physical confrontation at the construction site was meant to delay progress on the dam by even one day,
 ...then the propaganda war using the media was aimed at attacking the dam project itself.
At first, there were those who had doubts about that strategy, but there was nobody now who called those results into question...
But in order to maintain those media ties, a colossal amount of money was required.
As long as the amount of funds they had was abundant, things would turn out fine.
It couldn't be argued that it was a massive expense, but the results spoke for themselves.
...But, with the conflict continuing to drag on, the circumstances had changed.
The head of the Sonozaki family-- no, the one who sat at the pinnacle of the Hinamizawa's Three Families, Oryou, had suggested the idea herself, so it was already untouchable, and continued to be allowed to drain from the budget.
...Nobody acknowledged that it should be so allowed, but nobody could say anything.
 ...That was the price of dealing with the mass media.

<Kiichiro>
"...What do you think, Oryou-san?"
The only person who could object to a plan proposed by the head of the Sonozaki household herself was probably Mayor Kimiyoshi.
Oryou... with a hard-to-define expression on her face, as if she had severed herself from the fetters of mortal emotion, simply listened quietly to Kimiyoshi's words.
...But really, it was hard to tell if she was quietly listening or didn't even have the intention of listening at all.

<Kiichiro>
"Last year, we went through a lot of trouble getting people to wrap their heads around the price hike on the bulletins we were putting out. 

<Kiichiro>
...We convinced them it was just the one time... it just wouldn't do if we had another one this year...
 ...Right, Furude-san?"
The mayor looked to the priest and his wife from the Furude family for affirmation.
...The priest gave a vague expression, avoiding a prompt response.
But his wife gave her answer without a second thought.

<Rika's mom>
"That's right...
 The cost of the bulletins are a particularly harsh burden for the poorer families.
 Everybody is dealing with it for the sake of the village, but it's best we don't increase the prices any more."
The bulletin was, as its name implied, a bulletin published by the Onigafuchi Guardians.
It outlined the Alliance's activities, ideals, and resolve, but you couldn't deny the contents were rather piecemeal.
That bulletin's main goal wasn't to inform people, but rather was something to sell to businesses and people living in the village or connected to it, and using those sales to collect funds. 
...In other words, it had become something of a tax.
Of course, it didn't have to be said that this was one of the main sources of income for the Onigafuchi Guardians.
Originally, purchase was supposed to be voluntary, but in Hinamizawa it had silently become the opposite.
In the neighboring towns as well, it seemed that many businesses were buying copies just to avoid butting heads with the Alliance.
...The priest whispered to his wife to not say anything unnecessary, but was struck down decidedly with a cold glare.
Cowering from that glare, the priest shut his mouth.
The priest's wife always held the power in their relationship.
 ...That was because she was the one who carried the Furude bloodline.
The priest merely married into the family.
 He was nothing more than somebody who adopted the name just to join the Three Families.
He should have been able to find a spot fairly high up in the hierarchy of things, ...but the lack of authority in his voice meant that he had still not gained any favor.
Casting a backwards glance at her rather disparate parents, Rika continued to doodle whimsically without paying them any mind.
Signaled by a look from Oryou, Mion brought her ear closer to her grandmother.
There, something was said to her in a quiet voice.
After responding with a couple questions, with a nod from Oryou, Mion looked around the room and conveyed her grandmother's words...

<Mion>
"...There will be no freeze on the price increase for the bulletin."
Kimiyoshi made a face like he had just bit into something unpleasant, but that expression quickly disappeared like it had never happened at all...

<Kiichiro>
"B-But, Mion-chan.
 ...I think you already know this, but the cost of the bulletin is by no means easily affordable.
 It's a burden carried by everybody in Hinamizawa. 

<Kiichiro>
If we make people carry too much of that burden, it's possible we'll collapse from the inside..."

<Mion>
"...And who on the inside would start that collapse?"

<Kiichiro>
"Who? ...I didn't mean it like that--"

<Mion>
"...I'm asking who would be the first to buckle."
Being cross-examined by a girl who still had fragments of childishness remaining within her, the words stuck in Kimiyoshi's throat as he sunk into silence.
Mion repeated her question once more, looking around the crowded room.
Everybody refrained making eye contact to avoid being pierced by her gaze...
The words she had spoken were unarguably said in proxy for Oryou.
That's why when Mion spoke them, they carried the same weight.
 ...But, the look in her eyes was different.
Like Oryou's, they had a hawkish gaze, strong enough that anybody looking upon them would freeze in their tracks and yield.
...But, that gaze was without question, one that belonged to Mion herself.
As Mion would eventually inherit everything from Oryou, the day when she would stand up as a young and capable leader in her own right would come.
...Nobody wanted to believe otherwise for even a minute.
...That's why, nobody even thought of Mion as just some sort of little kid.

<Mion>
"...Kimiyoshi-san.
 Nobody will lose their resolve over something like a price hike on the bulletin."

<Kiichiro>
"....Hmm...
 ....mmm..."
Kimiyoshi, while grumbling a little bit, made a gesture as if to say he had no objection.

<Mion>
"...The expenses related to the mass media will continue.
 If those expenses become too much, we'll have no choice but to continue the price hikes."
Mion had rendered her judgement.
Everybody bowed their heads, silently listening to her words.

<Mion>
"In the name of Mion Sonozaki, as acting head of the Sonozaki family.
 I hereby declare that all this shall be effective immediately.
 ...There shall be no objections, and any opposition shall be removed by force."
The formal decree was read aloud, indicating her judgement.
....There would be no retrial. But there was a certain authority behind those words that even a courthouse couldn't compare to.
If she was a judge, she would have banged her gavel, signaling that the matter was settled.
 ...Mion pulled out a large bell from inside her clothes and rang it.

Everybody present could only prostrate themselves before the harsh sound of the bell.

<Akasaka>
"...Well.
 ...That's a rather old-fashioned family council, isn't it."

<Sato>
"A young guy like you would probably find it hard to believe.
 ...In an antiquated place like this, these types of things have firm roots."
It was exactly as Ooishi had said.
...The old system of the Three Families had vanished, and now the Sonozaki family was running things by themselves.
On top of that, their rule was borderline despotic.

<Akasaka>
"...Was that the end of the meeting?"

<Sato>
"No, there's more.
 I'll continue."
Eventually, after the ringing of the bell ceased, there was a deafening silence.
Within all of that, a lone man shuffled closer to Mion and whispered something in her ear.
Mion asked several questions quietly in response.
When she was satisfied, she motioned for the man to leave.
...The man who talked to Mion was a member of a gang that her father was the leader of.
That organization had the entire area of Shishibone City under its control, so it was quite well known even here.
...Of course, this was talking about the criminal underworld, so it's not like just anybody would know...
 But just showing a patch with the gang symbol on it was enough to resolve any disputes in the neighborhood...
Mion's biological father, to Oryou, was her daughter's husband.
The power of that man's gang was the driving force that controlled the dark underbelly of the Onigafuchi Guardians.
...And so that man, from his position as the next-in-line to control the Three Families, continued to coerce everybody around him with his unconventional presence...
Mion exchanged a look with her father.
...Was it okay for her to tell what she just heard directly to Oryou?
...It looked like she was asking him that question.
Her father gently, but firmly, nodded his response.
Mion also nodded, then sidled up to Oryou and informed her of something...
Eventually, Mion finished conveying her message, separated herself from Oryou, and fixed her posture, waiting for Oryou to signal her response.
It wasn't often that Oryou showed any emotion.
...That's why, when she started to laugh quietly, a vague sense of uneasiness crept over everybody in the room.

<Oryou>
"...That's... quite the conundrum isn't it.
 ...Keh keh keh keh...!"
Oryou was laughing so happily that Kimiyoshi had to hesitantly ask.

<Kiichiro>
"...What is it, Oryou-san?"

<Oryou>
"...If this land is like a mother to us... then this business with the dam is like somebody threatening our mother's life, isn't it?"
Kimiyoshi, unable to comprehend the meaning of her words, looked confused.
Oryou, with a wide grin on her face, turned towards everybody and addressed them in a clarion voice.

<Oryou>
"...The Minister behind the Dam Project, is apparently rattled over the kidnapping of his grandson.
 That makes us even.
 ...keh keh keh keh!"

<Akasaka>
"...That's absurd!!!"
Information on the kidnapping of Minister Inukai's grandson... shouldn't have leaked from anywhere.
 ...How did they know!?
Even we didn't know much about the kidnapping incident.
Exactly how did an antiquated household so far away from Tokyo come to know of it?
...It was a tranquil place, but I couldn't help but have an uneasy feeling about Hinamizawa Village.
...At some point, I had mentally filed this place away as unrelated to the incident at hand.
...That mental paperwork had just blown away in the wind.

<Akasaka>
"...How... did the Onigafuchi Guardians know about that..."
Sato-san, unable to come up with an answer, fell into silence...

<Akasaka>
"...I'm sorry.
 Please continue."

<Sato>
"...Sure."

<Kiichiro>
"The Minister of Construction's grandson... was kidnapped?
 ...Oryou-san, is that true?"
That major of an incident was nowhere to be seen in the newspapers or on TV.
...But, in Hinamizawa, there was nothing strange about Oryou knowing something that the rest of the world didn't.

<Oryou>
"Our pain is the pain of losing a mother.
 ...I don't think it completely makes up for it, but the pain of losing a grandchild...
 ...keh keh keh keh!
 He'll have to bear with that for a bit.
 ...Don't you think?"
...The last question wasn't addressed to anybody in particular.
 ...It was as if she was looking for consensus.

<Oryou>
"...Still... land and a human child are different things.
 ...I don't mind hiding him here... but I want no harm to befall him.
 ...The child isn't to blame.
 ...Make sure to keep that in mind."

<Akasaka>
"That means that.... the Onigafuchi Guardians were involved in the kidnapping!?"

<Sato>
"..Hrm... I can't say for certain."

<Akasaka>
"Why?
 Even though their leader, Oryou, was clearly giving orders on the treatment of the kidnapped child!?"

<Sato>
"Lad, you see.
 This is what the Sonozaki Family always does."

<Akasaka>
"...Always does?
 What do you mean by that?"
...Let's say there was a particular problem.
...One that wasn't exactly favorable for the Sonozaki family.
If Oryou shows 'concern' over that particular problem,
 hearing that, somebody who attended the family council would 'be helpful.'
As a result, Oryou's wish would be granted.
...However, neither Oryou or anybody else would know who actually did it.
With this kind of clever little ploy, the Sonozaki family was able to manipulate events even though they had their hands laid out on the table.

<Akasaka>
"Then... that means that somebody who was at the family council was the culprit?"

<Sato>
"Or, there's the possibility that there was never a culprit in the first place.
 ...Oryou herself, in that room full of people, didn't explicitly say that somebody pulled off the kidnapping.
 She was just giving her 'opinion.'"
It was an odd and unpleasantly secretive way of doing things.
...Were they involved or weren't they?
 ...I couldn't see beyond the veil.
This much, however, I could say with certainty.
This kidnapping was an ironclad secret.
 ...No matter how high a position somebody was in, even they wouldn't know about it.
If there was somebody who would know about it, they would be connected to Public Safety.
 In other words, one of us.
The only other options were people connected to the case itself.
...Including the Minister, there would be people affected by the incident.
 ...Or... the people that committed it.
...In any case... there was no way an old household in a place removed from Tokyo by over 6 hours of highway travel should know about it.
 Them knowing at all was already strange.
...My suspicions began to accumulate.
 ...Like falling snow.

<Sato>
"...That's as much as Oryou said in regards to the kidnapping.
 ...Hopefully what you wanted to find out was in there."

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Sato>
"...After this, it's up to you.
 ...I don't know what kind of work you're doing, but if you're going up against the Sonozaki family, you'd best prepare yourself. 

<Sato>
...Ooishi might be fearless, but even he's been attacked two or three times.
 He hasn't been wearing it lately, but at one point he was wearing a stab-proof vest while off-duty."

<Akasaka>
"...Oh?
 ...Thanks for the warning. I'll be careful."

<Sato>
"...You speak pretty well.
 Are you from Tokyo, by any chance?"

<Akasaka>
"Huh?
 ...What's your point?"
Investigators were always close to danger.
 ...It was best not to divulge any information on myself.

<Sato>
"Your job.

 ...Could you possibly be somebody from the Metropolitan Public Safety Division?"


<Akasaka>
"..."
I couldn't remain silent here.
 It would be the same thing as admitting it.

<Akasaka>
"...Huh?
 No way!
 ...Hahahaha!"

<Sato>
"...This wasn't accounted for in the money I got from the boss...
 but as somebody who played at the same table today,
 I'll give you this one as a freebie. 

<Sato>
After Oryou talked about the kidnapping, there was one other topic that came up."
Another topic that Oryou brought up?
...And right before he told me this, Sato-san asked if I was from the Metropolitan Public Safety Division?
 In other words...
...What those two things meant caused a chill to run up my spine.

<Old person>
"...So you see...
 ...That in order to investigate the kidnapping of the Minister's grandson,
 there's word that there will be an investigator from Public Safety dispatched all the way from Tokyo."

<Kiichiro>
"...An investigator from Public Safety?"

<Old person>
"...They can't be reckless and make a big deal over the kidnapping,
 so it seems the Metropolitan Public Safety Division is investigating this on their own.
 ...Ain't that grand.
 ...Hm?
 What is it?"
Rika, who had been drawing the entire time and was completely uninterested in the conversation up until now, looked at Oryou with an interested face as soon as the topic of Public Safety came up.

<Rika>
"...Did the Metropolitan Police come?"

<Old person>
"Ohhh ...So Rika-chama knows about the Metropolitan Police Department?
 ...That's very admirable."

<Rika>
"...Who came?"

<Old person>
"...Is there anybody that knows what kind of guy from Public Safety came here?"
Mion's father raised his hand slightly.

<Mion's dad>
"...I hear that it's a nice young piece of fresh meat."

<Rika>
"...Fresh meat?
 Is it nice and tender?"

<Mion's dad>
"Hm? Haha!
 Yeah, it is.
 ...Fresh meat."
Mion's father smiled wryly as he answered Rika's question.

<Rika>
"...Tender and tasty?"

<Mion's dad>
"...Yeah."

<Rika>
"Tender and tasty."
Rika smiled with interest.
...Why did Rika suddenly act interested only when it came to this topic?
 ...That was a question that apparently nobody had the answer to.

<Old person>
"...Does Rika-chama know something about this man?"

<Rika>
"...
...I don't know."
After her rather flat reply, Rika buried herself underneath Oryou's futon again...
But when she buried herself there, Rika no longer started drawing again. Instead, she was making an expression like she was deep in contemplation...

<Mion's dad>
"...What shall we do about him?
 Mother."
Mion's father posed the question.
 ...He had the type of uncouth expression on his face indicating that, given the order, he could snuff the problem out at any time.

<Oryou>
"...He came all the way to Hinamizawa.
 ...Let him take it easy for a little while."

<Mion's dad>
"So you're saying to just let him go around as he pleases...?"
Mion's father asked in response.
Oryou smiled thinly as she responded.

<Oryou>
"...Leave him alone.
 ...But... If he starts causing too much mischief, when that happens, don't hold back.
 ...I don't enjoy being taken lightly."

<Sato>
"...Is what they talked about apparently.
 ...It couldn't be that you're that fresh meat from the Metropolitan Police, are you?"

<Akasaka>
"....It couldn't be.
 ...Hahahaha."
The sensation of cold, bristling fear began to crawl its way up my back.
This family council took place, last night.
 ...In other words, yesterday.
...Then, today, when I was dressed up as a tourist headed towards Hinamizawa... my cover was already blown?
...When I remembered the first person I met when I got to the bus stop... I couldn't breathe.
...The person at the family council who expressed interest in the man being dispatched from the Metropolitan Police, Rika Furude.
And then, the person who was waiting for me the whole time in the bus shelter, Rika Furude.
...It was an unthinkable image.
 ...No, it was a delusion.
When we met at that bus shelter... did Rika-chan already know my true identity?
Did she know that I was Akasaka, dispatched from the Metropolitan Police Department, and come to meet me...?
...Then, including Mayor Kimiyoshi... every villager that I met... everybody knew but just pretended not to...?
Because Oryou had given instructions not to interfere?
...Thinking about it logically...
 ...it didn't seem possible.
I met quite a number of people.
...If there's people that are good at acting, then there's people who are bad at hiding things.
...If there was that many people, then there should have been somebody among them who knew I was from Public Safety and couldn't hide their hostility.
...However, I didn't feel any presence like that.
But then, even still...
...Why did Oryou tell them to leave me alone?
Was it because if they were careless about it, it would only raise more suspicion?
Or was it because they believed a rookie like me wouldn't be able to find anything?
Akasaka is a coward.
...I recalled that strange voice which could only make me believe that Rika-chan had been possessed.
...That unknown entity, no matter how you looked at it, knew my true identity from the get-go.
...And then... how did it warn me again?
That's right.
 ...It warned me to hurry up and go back to Tokyo.
Instead of the realistic worry that the Onigafuchi Guardians had discovered my identity, the absurd worry brought on by the unknown girl stuck with me more.
...What exactly was that girl?
 ...What was the thing I would eventually regret?
That mysterious girl.
 ...Rika Furude.
Let's stop this.
 ...Everything I was thinking of right now was merely conjecture.
Tomorrow, first thing in the morning, I'll report everything I heard right now to HQ and await further orders.
There was no mistaking that the possibility the Onigafuchi Guardians were related to this case was there.
...And that the fact that my cover was blown meant I was in a precarious position.
...But as everybody at HQ was already extremely busy, they might not be able to spare the support.

<Sato>
"...Is that everything?
 If you want, I can drop you off wherever you like."

<Akasaka>
"Ah... sorry.
 In that case, the station where we originally met, please."
A rural road where even a street light was rare.
...I couldn't see anything.
I wasn't aware of anything but the asphalt that was lit up by the headlights.
Outside of that light, was it simply darkness?
 Or was there something lurking there, waiting to strike?
...I had to think I drew the short straw here.
...I wanted to go back to Tokyo.
For some reason, the voice of the girl warning me to go back to Tokyo still lingered in my head...



[Himatsubushi Ch.5]

...I had a restless night's sleep.
I did nothing but turn over repeatedly during a night that seemed like it lasted for eternity.
Even then, I eventually fell asleep at some point... not realizing how high in the sky the sun had risen.
I shook off the urge to go back to sleep.
It was then I noticed that the phone was ringing.
The time was almost half past ten in the morning.
It was clearly too late for a wake-up call.

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san?
 Good morning, it's Ooishi.
 Nfu fu fu!"
Waking up to the sound of Ooishi's voice was little too much of a shock.
My delicate ears were ringing.
...But thanks to that shock, I was suddenly wide awake.

<Akasaka>
"...Ah... uhhh, hello.
 Good morning."

<Ooishi>
"Hmmm?
 Could it be you just woke up?
 Even though you're on assignment, it's still not good to be asleep during regular business hours.
 Na ha ha ha."

<Akasaka>
"You're absolutely right.
 ...I'll be more careful in the future."

<Ooishi>
"I have another tidbit that might wake you up even more.
 ...There was something interesting mixed in with the lost and found at the Hinamizawa Police Box."

<Akasaka>
"Lost and found?"

<Ooishi>
"Let's leave the details for when you get here.
 You think you'll be able to make it before noon?"

<Akasaka>
"No, no, I'll be there right away!"
Ooishi already knew what my mission was.
Since Ooishi said it was something that would wake me up...
 It was hard to believe that it would be irrelevant to me.
Honestly speaking, judging by the information from Sato-san yesterday,
 knowing that my cover was already blown, I couldn't wander to and from Hinamizawa carelessly.
...In other words, my investigation was at an impasse.
If there was some information there that could put me back on the trail, that would be nothing less than a stroke of good fortune.
After vigorously washing my face, I pulled on my jacket and hailed a taxi, heading towards the Okinomiya Police Station.

<Ooishi>
"Oh, you're here.
 The Genius Mahjong Player has arrived."

<Akasaka>
"My apologies for being late.
 ...So, exactly what popped up?"
With absolutely no intention of reminiscing about last night's mahjong game, I pressed him to get to the point.
Ooishi, anticipating that I would act that way, cut to the chase without any resistance.

<Ooishi>
"...Like I said earlier, something arrived from the Hinamizawa Police Box's lost and found this morning."
Lost items that were turned over to the police box were sent to Okinomiya Station after the paperwork was filled out.
Ooishi pulled out a plastic bag from a drawer, and laid its labelled contents on the desk.

<Akasaka>
"...Is that a wallet?"

<Ooishi>
"Indeed.
 ...There was small change inside, but no bills.
 We thought that a pickpocket threw it away after pulling out the contents.
 At first."
I didn't understand how this wallet, so far removed from Tokyo, could possibly be related to the kidnapping.
...If it had drawn Ooishi's attention,
 it would have to be something dramatic, like if the wallet belonged to the missing grandchild.
...That would be absurd.
...Like something that convenient would happen.
If that was it, then there were probably initials written on the wallet.
Like the initials of Toshiki Inukai, the Minister's grandson. "T.I."
Thinking like that, at this point I didn't suppose that this wallet was something that could get Ooishi so excited.
Ooishi, after putting on a pair of disposable plastic gloves, handed me a pair of the same.
I didn't feel that this wallet was such an important thing, so I had my doubts about whether there was any point in putting on gloves. However, I didn't want Ooishi's intentions to go to waste, so I put them on.
Ooishi opened up the plastic bag and pulled it out, showing me the back.
...As I had imagined, there were initials engraved there.
But, it was slightly more detailed than what I had thought, with "Toshiki I." marked on it.
Ooishi grinned at me with a look on his face that said "see?"
...We can't confirm from that that this belongs to the Minister's grandson, I informed him calmly.
...This wallet was irrelevant. It was nothing more than Ooishi's overeagerness.
First of all, there was absolutely no way, in this distant locale, that the missing grandson's wallet would be found with such convenient timing.
...After all, the Onigafuchi Guardians wasn't related to the case in the first place.
...So there was no way this wallet belonged to the grandson...
Why I wanted to decide that was the case, even I didn't really know.
Even though what should have been a top secret case was leaked before I had even been dispatched.
...In this situation, how could I say this was definitely unrelated?
Would it be more prudent to pay more attention to this wallet?
...It had only been a couple of days since I arrived in Hinamizawa.
...But in those couple of days, due to the number of remarkable events, my nerves might have become a little-- just a little frayed.
 Shaking my head slightly, I cleared it of unnecessary thoughts.
Ooishi opened the wallet's zipper, revealing the contents.
Inside was small change and a number of crumpled receipts.
Ooishi, from that jumble, pulled out a folded card.
...Seeing that, my heart stopped for a moment.
It was a card from a dental examination.
The name "Toshiki Inukai," and the age.
 ...A perfect match.
The dentist's location... was in Tokyo.
...There was no need to explain any further.
...How far was it from Tokyo to Hinamizawa?
It was far enough that taking the bullet trains and cars would still take several hours.
Why would a wallet with a dental examination card from Tokyo inside show up in Hinamizawa?
Could it belong to a tourist who came from Tokyo?
Or maybe a villager on vacation to Tokyo just happened to pay a visit to the dentist?
 No, it had to have fallen into somebody's bag by accident...
In my mind, I desperately struggled to find a possible excuse as to why this wallet didn't belong to Toshiki Inukai.
It was as if it just wouldn't do for this wallet to belong to him...
However... weeding out any possibility for error one by one...
 ...the haze surrounding the wallet in front of me faded, gradually letting it come into clear focus.

<Ooishi>
"...See?"

<Akasaka>
"..."
I felt a shiver of electricity run up my spine.
My pulse quickened, and a thin film of sweat began to coat my entire body...
...From Ooishi's point of view, I was probably slack-jawed and spaced out, with a slovenly look on my face.

<Akasaka>
"...Did you get information from the dental office?"

<Ooishi>
"That's your job, Akasaka-san.
 I didn't go that far."

<Akasaka>
"...When did this wallet show up?"

<Ooishi>
"The person who picked it up was a villager.
 They did so yesterday, it seems."

<Akasaka>
"Not that, I mean, when was this wallet dropped?"

<Ooishi>
"It rained here last week, exactly seven days ago.
 It doesn't look like the contents are water-damaged, so the longest it could be would probably be six days."

<Akasaka>
"Does anybody else at this station have knowledge of the existence of this wallet?"

<Ooishi>
"The officer who first encountered it at the Hinamizawa Police Box.
 And also the two or three people in charge of the lost and found.
 Other than that, it's just me and you. 

<Ooishi>
If it's involved in a classified case, it'd be bad to talk about, wouldn't it?
 I don't intend to wag my tongue."

<Akasaka>
"...May I borrow a phone?"

<Ooishi>
"Go ahead.
 Dial 0 to get an outside line."
I dialed the phone number inscribed on the examination card.
I could hear my pulse pounding inside my head.
...Ahh, could there possibly be something so absurd!?
The addresses on the receipts and cards inside the wallet were all from around the area where the grandson lived.
The name on the examination card was also a match,
 the time we deduced that the wallet had been left behind also matched up with the timeline of the kidnapping.
Of course, it was possible I could just laugh it off as all a big pile of coincidences.
...There wasn't any strong evidence.
...Rather than all this circumstantial proof, the contents of the phone call I was about to make would have a much greater meaning...

<Nakagawa Dentistry>
"...Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.
 This is Nakagawa Dental Office."

<Akasaka>
"Hello. This is the Okinomiya Police department.
 I have a misplaced wallet here, and am trying to get in contact with the owner.
 Would you be able to help me?
 Inside the wallet, there was an examination card from your office. 

<Akasaka>
...Yes.
 The name is Toshiki Inukai.
 If I give you the number on the card, would you be able to look up the phone number?
 ...Yes, thank you.
 If you could."
Still holding the receiver, I pulled out a notebook from my breast pocket with my free hand.
...I opened it up to the page with the grandson's address and phone number recorded on it.

<Akasaka>
"Yes, hello.
 ....Yes, go ahead."
I compared the phone number written in my notebook to the one that was being read out on the other end of the line.
...During that process, I spun around to look behind me uneasily.
I locked eyes with Ooishi.
...Ooishi looked puzzled, wondering what the matter was.
Why would I feel uneasy and look behind me?
...That was because the person on the end of the line...
 was reading out the numbers as though doing so straight from my notebook...
It seemed that HQ was in quite an uproar thanks to my report.
No matter how many times the authenticity of the evidence I had linked to the grandson was called into question, I could only respond that it was the truth...
When the lead investigator first picked up the phone,
 I was grilled about the evidence I'd found that was almost too good to be true (if I do say so myself)...
...But after having doubt after doubt dispelled, he fell into silence.
 ...The receiver was finally handed over to the section chief.
When he picked it up, the background thrum on the other end of the line disappeared, and I knew that it had gone completely silent.
After asking the same questions about the wallet that the lead investigator did, the chief quietly spoke his next words.

<Chief>
"Got it.
 We'll dispatch several people as reinforcements.
 They should be able to make it there by evening.
 Akasaka-kun, please continue with your investigation of the area. 

<Chief>
Get some information on the spot where the wallet was found.
 Kanou-san will select some people and head directly there..."
The fact that he was sending Kanou, the lead investigator, here meant that the chief had decided there was a possibility that the Onigafuchi Guardians were somehow implicit in the kidnapping.
However, it felt as though until the lead investigator, whom he trusted, had verified the evidence with his own eyes, he was still going to be skeptical about it.

<Ooishi>
"How'd it go?"

<Akasaka>
"It seems that HQ is sending reinforcements.
 I was ordered to investigate the area.
 ...Where was the wallet dropped?"

<Ooishi>
"Around Takatsudo apparently.
 ...This is Okinomiya.
 All the way over here, this is Hinamizawa.
 Then, even further upstream, way up around here, is Takatsudo."
Ooishi explained where the wallet was found by pointing to locations on the map on the wall.
This place called Takatsudo was even more remote than Hinamizawa was.

<Ooishi>
"There's hardly anybody living in the area around Takatsudo.
 It was deserted a long time ago.
 It's littered with abandoned houses, so it's really quite desolate around there."

<Akasaka>
"...Ooishi-san.
 Could I ask you to guide me to Takatsudo?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, I don't mind.
 You can't really get in and out of Hinamizawa as you please by yourself, after all.
 Of course, I'll have to make you wear the cap and mask again."
That Ooishi had agreed to accompany me was very reassuring.
...If Sato-san's info was to believed, my cover had been blown.
I wasn't sure if the villagers had realized that the fresh meat dispatched from Public Safety was the tourist that had visited the village yesterday (in other words: me).
But deciding that they hadn't noticed would have been overly optimistic.
Given a cursory thought, Takatsudo, where the wallet was found, couldn't be ruled out as a hiding spot for the kidnappers.
The Takatsudo area didn't have any residential buildings, nor was it alongside a highway. There wasn't a reason for even the locals to go out of their way to visit it.
...It was exactly what you would call a long-forgotten ghost town at the end of the road.
You couldn't ask for a better place to hold a kidnapped grandson.
Also, you couldn't get to Takatsudo without passing through Hinamizawa first.
Those several conditions made the area all the more important.
I couldn't brush it off any longer.
...There was no longer any doubt that Onigafuchi Guardians, or somebody hired by them, were involved in the kidnapping.
If that was the case...
 Then the fact that this wallet was found might have already been leaked to them.
...They even knew so much as how the Public Safety Division was operating.
 The case of the wallet couldn't be something they didn't know.
In that case... there was a possibility that the enemy was lying in wait.
To dive alone into enemy territory surrounded by enemy territory, to say the least, required an amount of courage--nay, recklessness-- that I just did not have.

<Akasaka>
"Without your company, Ooishi-san, I wouldn't be able to step into the village so easily.
 Thank you very much for your cooperation.
 ...Honestly, I thought you would ask for more money."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha.
 Well, if we're being honest, Hinamizawa isn't exactly a place I like to go to.
 I'd at least appreciate it if you paid for the cab fare. 

<Ooishi>
Still, it's not a request I can refuse from a friend that's played at the same table as me.
 Nfu fu fu...!"
Ooishi grinned as he pounded me on the back.
It struck me that he just didn't want to jump ship rather than having any sort of sense of duty towards his job.
Even so, that didn't really matter.
 Right now I really appreciated the gesture.

<Akasaka>
"Well then, shall we hurry up and get going?"
...If the enemy knew that the police had obtained the wallet...
Then they would probably have moved the hostage to a different place.
 There wasn't a moment to lose.
But Ooishi, without regard to the fact that we were about to head out, began to remove his jacket.

<Akasaka>
"...What are you doing?"

<Ooishi>
"Well, just a precaution.
 If you want me to poke the beehive to get your honey, I have to be rather well prepared, you see.
 Do you want to put one on too?"
What Ooishi pulled from the drawer below the desk was a stab-proof vest...
His name was Toshiki Inukai.
The grandson of the Minister of Construction, Inukai.
There was only one reason for him being here.
If you didn't include gym or art class, his grades were above average.
That was the result of having private tutoring sessions twice a week.
If you omitted the fact that he still couldn't do pull-ups, there wasn't much else that would make him hate school.
Of course, he understood full well that his grandfather was a cabinet minister.
But he also knew that not too many people were that interested in their relationship.
 He didn't like to go out of his way to bring up his grandfather, or to call him the Minister of Construction.
And finally, he at least tried to know a little more about what kind of work the Minister of Construction did than your average Joe.
What that entailed was that when you tried your best to make life better for the masses... sometimes you made a few enemies.
He knew that all too well from the time he'd spent as class representative.
His grandfather had many enemies.
...He knew that he might personally catch some of that fallout, so he had to be twice as cautious.
 He was taught that by his parents.
That's why... the moment he was kidnapped, he instantly knew that this was one of those occasions.
He understood that he wasn't being treated as Toshiki Inukai, the person, but rather as Toshiki Inukai, the grandson of the Minister of Construction.
That he wasn't personally at fault, but that this was the result of some unavoidable trouble with his grandfather's work. 
...It made little difference, but when he realized it wasn't because of anything he did, he was able to relax, if only a little.
Of course, at first he was struck with a terror befitting his age, wondering what was going to happen to him.
But, after a while of being tied up and only able to stay lying down, he began to ponder a great many things.
First, he thought about the reason he was being abducted like this.
He understood the answer to that easily.
He was taken hostage to coerce his grandfather, the Minister.
 There was no doubt about that.
He didn't know exactly what the Minister of Construction did, but it was easy to imagine that there was much to be gained from threatening him.
He respected his grandfather more than most.
He earnestly believed that his own grandfather was within the top 20 of the most important people in Japan.
That was exactly why he wouldn't forgive anybody who tried to threaten his beloved grandfather. More importantly, he wouldn't forgive anybody who would use him as a tool to threaten his grandfather.
His grandfather was really busy, and rarely had time to meet with relatives.
That's why, with what little time he did manage to scrape together, he just dropped by unannounced.
And, as an apology for not being able to meet during new year's or summer vacation, he doted on his grandson, very, very much.
The number of times that Toshiki was looked upon with disregard just because his grandfather was a politician and a minister certainly weren't few. 
But he never thought even once that he wanted his grandfather to quit being a politician.
Because it was his beloved grandfather, he wanted him to continue his career as long as possible from the bottom of his heart.
However, Toshiki was now being held hostage, and his grandfather was being threatened.
His grandfather, who called him the apple of his eye, was surely suffering.
He might do anything to save his grandson.
Maybe even putting aside his ideology if it was required to save his grandson.
He might cave into the culprits' demands if it meant saving his grandson.
When Toshiki thought about that...
 ...an inexplicable anger welled up within him.
In his current situation, he was unable to forgive the cowards who would make his beloved grandfather suffer by using such dastardly means.
That feeling swelled up inside of him, displacing the fear.
What he thought of first, was something any boy would imagine.
Get out of these bonds, beat up the bad guys, then hand them over to the police.
Images of all the brave heroes from all the manga he had read passed through the back of his mind.
In his imaginary scenario, he slipped his bonds easily, floating like a butterfly to evade his captors, then stinging like a bee to bring them all down.
In the end, it was nothing more than his silly little fantasy. But with his vision obstructed and unable to see anything, it was something that he could get into more than any anime at the moment.
In actuality, he was enjoying these little scenarios in his head for the long period of time he was tied up. His captors hadn't really done anything to him that they would feel sorry for.
However, eventually he began to grow tired of his fantasies, and more realistic scenarios began to run through his head. It was then he realized that none of them were a solution.
...Yes, he wanted to do something for his grandfather who was being threatened.
That he was being held here to inflict pain on his grandfather was the thing that he could least forgive, and also the most vexing.
...And then, he noticed.
There was a much simpler way he could save his grandfather without having to beat up his despicable captors.
That was, to remove himself as a hostage from the hands of these villains.
If he was to disappear from here, his captors would have nothing to threaten his grandfather with.
The captors had restrained him, but they didn't treat him roughly, and they made sure he was fed well enough.
...Meaning, at most, he was nothing more than the means for their threat.
 They weren't looking to bully or kill him out of spite.
If he behaved, no ill would befall him.
Realizing that gave him a strong sense of courage.
And carrying his train of thought this far, he let it run its course to its natural conclusion.
Right now, at this moment, Toshiki Inukai had decided to escape.
His ears had been stuffed with a spongelike material, acting as makeshift earplugs.
...However, they didn't actually do much to block out any sound, and he could overhear everything his captors were saying.
Realizing that this was to his advantage, even when his captors spoke to him, he acted like he couldn't hear them due to the earplugs.
His captors, thinking that he couldn't hear their conversation, talked about all sorts of things without any reservations.
 Thanks to that, he was able to obtain various pieces of information.
First off... this wasn't Tokyo.
It seemed that this was quite a distance away, and on top of that in the countryside, nestled deep in the mountains.
It also seemed that his captors were inconvenienced living out here, so he could deduce that this place was far removed from any sort of town.
Finally, whenever they went out to buy food or other supplies, they would always take a car.
That fact caused him some dismay,
 because he knew that the method he learned at school of running around blindly while shouting for help wouldn't work here.
He paused his little mental escape scenario there.
His ultimate goal was to find somebody who would help him.
If somebody who fit that description wasn't close by, his chances of escaping successfully grew slim.
A desolate far-off land deep in the mountains.
A place where you couldn't even go shopping without using a car.
...In this situation... escaping would be very difficult.
...He grew depressed, and after a little while, he returned to his original scenario.
 Imagining becoming a hero like in the manga he read and beating down his captors became his respite.
However, as he played those delusions out in his head...
 His heart, hating to surrender, continued to search for a way to escape.
 ...And then... he thought of a way.
If the goal was far away, then all he had to do was get closer.
His goal, in a nutshell, was to find somebody who would help him.
 In other words, somebody other than his captors.
If he faked being sick, then his captors would have to take him to the hospital, or bring a doctor to him.
They would probably be reluctant to do that.
 But, he already knew, that the hostage was more important than anything.
In the off chance that something happened--like him dying--occurred, they wouldn't be able to threaten anybody anymore.
Luckily, he had an experience that would help him fake a serious illness.
At the end of last year.
 He was inadvertently involved in a car accident and had to undergo surgery.
The scar from that surgery was still clearly visible on his lower torso.
He recalled the pain and suffering from that time.
The existence of that experience would make a huge impact on the realism of his performance.
 ...He was quite confident in his ability to fake an illness.

<Toshiki>
"....Ugggggghh...
 ...unggggggggggg....."
His captors at first took that as a sign he needed to use the washroom.
Untying only his arms, they tried to bring him there while he was still blindfolded.
But, he didn't try to get up.
His hands, now free, only clutched at his abdomen as he writhed in agony.

<Kidnapper>
"...Hey, what's wrong?
 Does your stomach hurt?"
He still had his earplugs in so he had to pretend he didn't hear his captors asking the question.
He was about to nod so he hurriedly had to stop himself.

<Kidnapper>
"Whass tha matter?"

<Kidnapper>
"...Yeah, the kid's clutching at his stomach.
 Must be a stomachache or something."
His captors looked down on his suffering form for a bit.
One of them proposed a course of action, while another laid his doubts that Toshiki might be faking it.

<Kidnapper>
"Whass wrong, boy?
 Yer tummy hurt?"

<Kidnapper>
"His ears are plugged, so he can't hear you."

<Kidnapper>
"Well, thass a problem.
 ...Do we got any medicine tha' works on stomach pain?
 Migh' wanna go to the pharmacy an' buy some?"

<Kidnapper>
"When it comes to stomach pain, there's a bunch of different meds, isn't there?
 As long we don't know the cause, we shouldn't just buy him any old medicine."

<Kidnapper>
"'E's 'olding 'is stomach, maybe 'e's just constipated.
 If ya buy 'im some medicine for tha', mebbe tha'll calm 'im down.
 It won' kill 'im if we're wrong, either."

<Kidnapper>
"Don't decide something like that on your own.
 It might be appendicitis or something.
 My uncle suddenly got it a while ago.
 That was pretty scary."
One of the captors leaned over beside the boy, who was bent over in agony.

<Kidnapper>
"...I feel sorry for the kid.
 ...Whoa, his whole body's covered in sweat...
 Is it your stomach?
 Does it hurt?
 Hey hey, if it hurts you shouldn't clutch at so tightly, it'll only make it worse..."
Realizing that his captors were concerned about his stomach, he 'inadvertently' let his shirt ride up...letting the scar from his surgery come into plain view.
His vision was still obscured with packing tape so he couldn't see their reaction to his scar.
But his captors were taken aback, and judging from their momentary silence, he had obtained the reaction he was looking for.

<Kidnapper>
"....Hey, this is bad.
 This scar, it's not that old."

<Kidnapper>
"...Does tha boy have a fever?
 There a thermometer around?"

<Kidnapper>
"No way we have one.
 But, that's a lot of sweat...
 Yeah, his forehead feels pretty hot, I think."

<Toshiki>
"..."

<Kidnapper>
"...I've heard that under prolonged stress, old wounds can be aggravated."

<Kidnapper>
"Then whadda we do!?
 Are ya sayin' tha' medicine won' work!?"

<Kidnapper>
"...We don't know what surgery this scar was from.
 ...But in any case... this is bad.
 In the worst case, it could be fatal..."

<Kidnapper>
"...This's bad.
 This's really, really bad..."

<Kidnapper>
"...Maybe we should have a doctor take a look at it.
 At this rate, there's a chance that he might suddenly die on us..."
Toshiki Inukai, with those few words, knew that the situation was progressing exactly as he had envisioned it, and snickering to himself on the inside, pressed his act even further.
He didn't even need to see to know that his captors were panicked and were running around like chickens with their heads cut off at this troublesome turn of events.

<Kidnapper>
"...Should we take him to the clinic?"

<Kidnapper>
"No...thass no good.
 ...Prob'ly better if tha doctor came here."

<Kidnapper>
"Dr. Irie, you mean?
 ...Is that okay?
 Will that be all right?"

<Kidnapper>
"...It'd be worse if anythin' happened to tha hostage.
 Nothin' we can do! It's an emergency!"
One of the captors hurriedly left in the car.
Another of the men, completely shaken up at this point, wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief.
...It looked like they were bringing a doctor.
As long as the doctor wasn't an accomplice, that doctor was his goal.
 He was someone he should seek help from.
His captors were probably wary of that happening.
They would be prepared for it.
...This would all come down to luck.
...Some of the sweat emerging from his brow was from that nervousness...
At that moment, the packing tape that was covering his eyes and ears was torn off.
The burning light that he was seeing for the first time in several days hurt his eyes.
After that, the gag that made it hard for him to breathe was also removed.

<Kidnapper>
"...Are you all right, kid?
 We're bringing a doctor to you right now.
 Just hold on for a bit."

<Toshiki>
".....Uhhhhhhnnnnn.....
 ....Gahhhhhhhh...."
The doctor was coming... the doctor was coming...
Now, how was he going to ask for help, and how was he going to get away from his captors?
 A plethora of thoughts began swirling through his mind.

<Kidnapper>
"...I think you know this already...
 ...but don't say anything unnecessary to the doctor.
 ...We don't want to hurt you or anything.
 You understand that, right?"
Toshiki Inukai nodded while feigning pain and obedience...
His expectations and the enemy's expectations.
...Whether they doubted he was faking his illness or not, they knew what his goal was, and would try to stop it.
His stomach contracted from the stress of this gambit, making it seem like his stomach really was starting to hurt.
 No, it really was.
But there was no reason to panic...
If he failed with his approach to the doctor, there was nothing to lose.
If there was something to lose, it was this method of faking illness to get in touch with a doctor.
If he could think of other methods from here on out, it wasn't much.
But, at the present, this was the easiest and most dramatic way he could think of.
...Ahh, the more he thought about it... the more it looked like this was his first and last gambit!
Eventually.... he heard the sound of a car approaching once again.
The sound of the car doors being hurriedly open and shut.
 The sounds of several footsteps approaching.
A young man in a white medical coat.
As he acknowledged the boy, a suspicious look showed itself on his face.

<Young Doctor>
"...Who's he?"

<Kidnapper>
"..."

<Young Doctor>
"...He's not one of the kids from the village, is he?"
The captors didn't respond.
 ...From the looks of it, the young doctor had realized that this was an abnormal situation.
One of the captors talked threateningly.

<Kidnapper>
"Thass got nothin' to do with ya, doc."

<Young Doctor>
"..."
For a while, the doctor and the captors silently glared at one another.
...However, unable to stand the sight of the boy continuing to suffer, the doctor-- as the captors had hoped-- didn't press any further.

<Young Doctor>
"...I'm concerned about this old surgical scar.
 What kind of operation was it?"

<Kidnapper>
"...We don't know."

<Toshiki>
"...Hmmm..."

<Young Doctor>
"I should really bring him back to the clinic."

<Kidnapper>
"Doc, we really can' really do that..."
The doctor said he wanted to bring the boy back to the clinic, but the captors simply silently shook their heads at the notion.
...it was a fleeting hope, but it was only natural that the captors would refuse.
At that moment, his eyes met with the doctor's.
Seeing that the boy's painful state was abnormal, the doctor suspected it was a serious illness.

<Young Doctor>
"...Are you all right?
 I'm a doctor.
 When was this surgical scar from?"

<Toshiki>
"....Unn..... guhhhh....
 ...Last year...
 ...during the winter...
 ...from an accident..."

<Young Doctor>
"An accident.
 ...I see...
 ...this is a problem..."
He couldn't let the doctor figure out that he was faking it here.
He had to somehow figure out some way to keep this going and tell the doctor that he was being confined and needed help.

<Young Doctor>
"I'm going to touch the affected area, okay?
 If it hurts, tell me where."

<Toshiki>
"...AHHHHHHHHH!!!

<Toshiki>
...Hmm ....hmmm...."
Seeing that it was extremely painful, the doctor crossed his arms and began to ponder.
He had to somehow get himself to a hospital.
To Toshiki Inukai, faking this illness was the performance of a lifetime.



[Himatsubushi Ch.6]


<Ooishi>
"Ehhh, good work, everyone.
 I know it's hot, but please do your best.
 If you catch anybody illegally dumping, please contact someone immediately.
 We'll act quickly."

<Man>
"Thank you for your cooperation, Ooishi-san.
 ...Please."
A gap wide enough for a single car was opened up in the barricade.
Ooishi, showing his gratitude-- or perhaps a threatening attitude-- with a short beep on the horn, rolled the car forward through the checkpoint.
This time, my appearance was the very embodiment of the word 'suspicious.'
A baseball cap, mask, and sunglasses.
On top of that even though it was sweltering, I was wearing a hoodie. Any respectable police officer would be loathe to not stop me for questioning.
I had meant to be overcautious knowing full well that my face was known...
 ...But it might have already been too late for that to have any use.
Using that as an excuse, I doffed the unbearably hot hoodie and windbreaker, ripped off the mask and hat and threw them in the seat behind me.

<Ooishi>
"...Oh my.
 Is that okay?"

<Akasaka>
"With a cheap little disguise like this,
 they probably figured it out anyways."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha.
 That just might be the case."
Ooishi, probably thinking that my unexpected behavior was funny, continued to laugh.
The beautiful and pristine scenery of Hinamizawa spread out before me.
...The village itself would have been quite beautiful if it weren't for the complicated circumstances surrounding it at the moment.
...I would absolutely love to take Yukie here for a drive one day.
...Come to think of it, I didn't get a chance to call her last night...
...I played around with the idea in my head.
But in reality, this village wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.
I had heard everything at the prefectural headquarters.
At the heart of this village, the intelligence network that the Three Families wielded was, due to blood ties and regional relationships, unbelievably well organized. 
Their net spread not just around Hinamizawa itself, but encapsulated the entirety of the city of Shishibone as well.
When I first heard that, somewhere in the recesses of my mind I didn't take it completely seriously.
How could a local organization out in the boonies here have something so grandiose?
...I couldn't deny that somewhere in the back of my mind I had ridiculed the thought.
But, not only were they really threatening the Minister, but they had demonstrated they had a complete grasp on our movements, which were supposed to be top secret.
...They were almost like the secret police that controlled a small Eastern-European country like in some spy novel.
The villagers here wouldn't bat an eye at getting their hands dirty if it meant fighting the dam project.
I also heard something like that at the prefectural headquarters.
Ah... now that you mention it, when I first arrived here, Ooishi also said that this place was a warzone, didn't he?
The residents of this village were at the same time freedom fighters.
Although by definition they were no different than guerillas or a militia.
They weren't protected by the Geneva Convention, but they also didn't have to adhere to those rules either.
This place was more of a quagmire than any legitimate battlefield. A secret war was unfolding...
I could drive along because Ooishi was with me...
 ...but if I was to leave this car for even something as trivial as looking for a vending machine... there was a chance I wouldn't return.
Even though a single shot hadn't been fired... this was a battlefield.
No... the reason why bullets weren't flying was simply because it was hard for a civilian to obtain a gun in Japan.
So they were probably just equipped with weapons other than guns that were easier to obtain.
That was why Ooishi was wearing that stab-proof vest, wasn't it?

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san, are you nervous?
 Nfu fu fu!"
The fact that I was apprehensive was, of course, picked up on by Ooishi.
If he already figured it out, there was no point in trying to deny or hide it.

<Akasaka>
"...Of course I am.
 We're headed into the heart of enemy territory alone, aren't we?
 I'm worried about if something unlikely happens with just the two of us."

<Ooishi>
"Something unlikely?
 Na ha ha ha ha ha!
 It'll be all right."

<Akasaka>
"Isn't everybody in this village our enemy?
 If everybody gets their stories straight, they could murder someone in broad daylight and there wouldn't be a shred of evidence.
 I'm asking about something like that."
This was what the ironclad rule of not barging into a yakuza office alone was about.
If there wasn't a neutral party involved, that area wasn't bound by the laws of common sense.
If something happened, you wouldn't be able to prove it, and there wasn't anybody who would take your side.
It was pretty much the definition of poking the bear.

<Ooishi>
"I've left word that we're headed towards the Hinamizawa area.
 And in the worst case, we've also got a radio.
 I know you're scared, Akasaka-san, but it's not that easy to pull off the perfect crime. 

<Ooishi>
...Well, of course that doesn't mean we can let our guard down, either."

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san, you're too worked up over this.
 You were more relaxed the last time we came up here together, weren't you?
 Na ha ha ha ha..."
Laughing it off, Ooishi thumped his chest and grinned, as if to say I could depend on him.

<Ooishi>
"Well, if it gets really iffy, nahahaha!
 This comes with having the badge."
Ooishi made a motion by sticking out his index finger.
 ...It was undoubtedly the image of a gun.

<Akasaka>
"...Will it be of any use?"

<Ooishi>
"If you're not afraid of dealing with the aftermath after you shoot, it's actually very reassuring."
An officer's gun was only for show.
If you really wanted to fire it, there were quite a number of stipulations, and you had to be prepared for the long probationary period afterwards.
That definitely wasn't worth it, so even if an officer did unholster his gun, there wasn't one who actually wanted to pull the trigger.

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san, are you carrying one?
 One of these."

<Akasaka>
dialog000"...Well, yeah."

<Ooishi>
"You ever fired it?"

<Akasaka>
"I have.
 ...For training, though."

<Ooishi>
"Well I guess that'd be true.
 Nfu fu fu...!"

<Akasaka>
"Well then, have you, Ooishi-san?"

<Ooishi>
"Me?
 Naahahahaha!
 Nawww, there's no way."
What was this? I thought he was laughing at me because he had experience!
 The two of us laughed together.

<Ooishi>
"I've also never pointed the barrel at anybody.
 I've looked down the barrel of a gun a few times though. 

<Ooishi>
...Just being made to look down the barrel like that is enough to shorten your lifespan by about three years."
Even if he had never fired a gun before,
you couldn't even begin to compare the amount of experience Ooishi had over me.
...At a time like this, I could only marvel again at how reliable Ooishi seemed.

<Ooishi>
"...Come to think of it, I didn't want to come this way in the middle of the day.
 But there's no way for a car to get through other than here. 

<Ooishi>
...Akasaka-san, just in case, put on the mask again to hide your face, please."

<Akasaka>
"...What's the matter?"

<Ooishi>
"Can you not hear it because the air conditioning is too loud?
 I'll turn it off.
 Try opening the window."
When I opened the window, a blast of hot air blew inside.
And then... I could hear angry yelling coming from far away.
At that moment, the forest gave way on either side of us, and our view expanded suddenly.
...And there could be seen the Hinamizawa Dam Construction Grounds.
 ...The very front line for Hinamizawa Village.

<Everyone>
"""We're absolutely opposed to the construction of the Hinamizawa Dam!!"""
The crackling blare of someone's voice sounded over an enormous loudspeaker.
The roar of angry voices continued to rumble.
The incredible volume had become a veritable sound cannon, spewing out its ammunition.
The prefabricated site office was surrounded by two sets of high fences laced with barbed wire.
Lined up in front of those fences were riot police and their vehicles.
And surrounding it all were the villagers.
They howled out their protests against the dam as a single entity.

<Ooishi>
"Oh... there's not too many of them today.
 We're in luck."

<Akasaka>
"...That's not too many?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, when there's a lot of them, the crowd reaches as far as the road.
 You wouldn't even be able to inch forward in a car."
At first, due to their overwhelming intensity, it looked to me like there was more people than there actually was, but upon closer inspection there were at most 50 to 70 of them.
But the six or seven propaganda trucks lined up that looked like they belonged to a band of thugs were a strange enough sight.
The villagers were also wearing helmets and bandanas, as well as covering their faces with masks, adding to the oddity of it all.
The propaganda trucks, after braying their chorus, had their volume turned up even higher and began to flood the area with sutras.
To say that the noise was downright violent wouldn't be an understatement.
From this distance it was still this loud... the glass in the office was probably rattling from the noise.

<Ooishi>
"They can't do anything there but take it.
 Those riot squad guys, every one of them is wearing earplugs, but they're still having their hearing damaged.
 Poor sobs."

<Akasaka>
"Can't you do something about it with noise ordinance laws?"

<Ooishi>
"Hmmm... our prefecture doesn't have any laws regarding noise ordinance.
 Also, those are sutras, right?
 We can't regulate religious activities.
 Those guys are pretty smart.
 Na ha ha ha..."
Is what I think Ooishi said.
Actually, no matter how tightly the window was shut, the booming sound of the sutras still filled the car.
I couldn't even hear what Ooishi, who was sitting right next to me, was saying.
As the car approached the line of propaganda trucks, the blare became difficult to bear.
...It wasn't enough to just plug my ears with my fingers, I had to hold my head to keep my skull from splitting apart...
If I had seen this terrifying energy sooner, I would have probably understood what Hinamizawa Village was much quicker.
Now I knew. They wouldn't blink an eye at sacrificing themselves in order to protect their home town.
Ahhh,
 so goddamn noisy...
 shut up shut up shut up...!!!
My head throbbed and felt like it was going to split apart, my eardrums crackled, and on top of it all, I felt like I was going to throw up.
With the road crowded with the throng of squatters, the propaganda trucks, and the riot police's vehicles, it was in no way easy to get by.
Even if you tried to shoo the squatters with the car horn,
 they were also wearing earplugs, oblivious to noises from the outside world, and wouldn't easily move. The car could only inch forward at a snail's pace.
...Even then, the car eventually got through, starting to leave the tumultuous noise behind.

<Ooishi>
"...Hey, the old guy that was playing mahjong with us last night?
dialog001 Remember him?"
I remembered that there was an older person who didn't exactly mince words.
The guy that Ooishi called "ol' man."

<Akasaka>
"There was someone like that."

<Ooishi>
"You see, he's the foreman of the main construction site.
 He's probably holed up in that prefab building, trying to work while irritated out of his mind.
 ...Poor fella."

<Akasaka>
"...You wouldn't be able to stand it if it's like that every day."

<Ooishi>
"Yeah.
 There's no end to the number of people who can't handle it and quit.
 But every time that happens, their wages go up, so I won't say it's in vain.
 Nfu fu fu...!"
Even having to deal with all that noise and hostility, they still made a wage that Ooishi found enviable.

<Ooishi>
"Dammit, these guys...
 Can they hear or can't they?"
A group of squatters were in the way of the car.
Ooishi, sufficiently annoyed, laid into the horn. But there was no indication that they were moving any time soon.
In this din, could they not even hear a car horn?
Or did they hear it, and were being malicious?
If there were any riot police nearby, they would have made people move, but it just so happened there weren't any around here.

<Ooishi>
"....Ah~~~ geez.
 Wait just a minute."
Ooishi opened up the door.
The hot air and even more heated roar of the crowd spilled into the car.

<Ooishi>
"...!!! ...!"
Ooishi said something as he grinned widely, but I couldn't hear what it was.
He was getting them to move.
 ...Something like that?
Ooishi stepped out of the car and closed the door.
 The din faded slightly.
I stared blankly as Ooishi headed towards the group and started some sort of conversation.
...Maybe we'd find the minister's grandson at Takatsudo.
At the very least, I wanted to find him there.
Find him, and slip the cursed bonds of this incomprehensible village.
I could only pray.
At that moment, a shadow was suddenly cast over me.
Somebody was standing right outside the passenger-side window, blocking the sunlight.
I spun around...
 looked up...
 and realized who the backlit figure was.

<Akasaka>
"...huh."
It was... a girl.
 It was Rika Furude.
The girl stared down at me with a bored look in her eyes.
I didn't have any justification for it, but I felt like I had been found by somebody I shouldn't be found by.
...To fill the silence, I raised my hand as I mouthed a meek greeting.
Of course, there was no way she heard my small voice in this clamor.
But even then, she should have seen me wave my hand in greeting.
In spite of that...
She simply stared down at me with a cold look on her face.
At that moment, the noise and heat spread throughout the car once again.
Ooishi had returned to the driver's seat.
Taking a look, the group that were blocking the road had started to move aside while glaring our way.

<Ooishi>
"Sorry to keep you waiting.
 Shall we go?
 ...Hm?"
Ooishi registered the figure of the girl behind me.
One of the villagers came over and picked her up.
In a manner of 'It's dangerous, so get away.'
It was then that she whispered one or two words--however, I couldn't hear any of it.

<Ooishi>
"Well then, let's go.
 I'm going to gun it, okay?
 But of course, still within the speed limit."
As if to shake off the still-audible angry voices, Ooishi floored the gas.
Along with the roar and the din and the shouting, the villagers and the girl quickly disappeared behind us.

<Ooishi>
"As soon as we're through here, we're in Takatsudo.
 Are you okay if we end up getting into a firefight?
 Don't be fumbling with the safety at the last moment, you hear?
 Nfu fu fu!"
Ooishi laughed mockingly again.
...I was more concerned with what the girl had said, however, as I was vaguely bothered by it.
...What was she trying to say with that apathetic and candid expression?

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"Suppose it's normal if you're nervous from here on out.
 But if you don't deal with it, there's a chance you might do something rash."
...But there was no longer a way to confirm what the girl had tried to tell me.
It might have been that the girl who warned me to go back to Tokyo again, or else...
Was saying to me who was here now, ignoring that warning...

<Rika>
"...Even though I warned you.
 ...What a fool."
I had the feeling she said something like that.



[Himatsubushi Ch.7]

If you were to call Hinamizawa a rather lonely village, then Takatsudo was outright desolate.
For your everyday city boy like me, I just couldn't understand why anybody would force themselves to live here.
There were signs that people had, but they were all covered in dust or enveloped in ivy, indicating that it was all abandoned.

<Akasaka>
"...People really lived in a place like this, didn't they."

<Ooishi>
"Well, it was a long time ago.
 A remote place like this is pretty rough for old folk to live.
 And the younger people probably wanted to try living in a more suitable place. 

<Ooishi>
If there's nobody left to take the reins, all that gets left is this."
Even if I had no personal attachment to the village, seeing the disused buildings made me feel a little sentimental.
It seemed that Ooishi also felt the same way.

<Akasaka>
"...Was the wallet found over here?
 The person who found it must have a good reason to come out to this desolate place."

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, there's some villagers who have a field out in the mountains here.
 They pass by here in the morning and evenings."

<Akasaka>
"The villagers who work in the fields walk by here every day?"

<Ooishi>
"No way.
 They probably go as far as they can by car."

<Akasaka>
"So in the early mornings and evenings, they pass by here, and just happened to find a single wallet?"

<Ooishi>
"...They probably did.
 Na ha ha ha!"

<Akasaka>
"...Where exactly did they say they found it?"

<Ooishi>
"In a thicket just a bit further ahead.
 The person who found the wallet just happened to have some stomach cramps, and was planning to use the thicket to do his business, it seems. 

<Ooishi>
It was there he happened to find it.
 Probably hoping there was some toilet paper in there.
 Nfu fu fu fu!"

<Akasaka>
"...Everything about that story just seems a little too convenient.
 Right from the discovery of the wallet, I just can't shake the feeling that something's off."
I expressed the feeling that I had from the start of the day quite frankly.
It seemed too good to be true, but it was unwavering proof.
But it was too perfect... sickeningly so.
 That was my feeling.

<Ooishi>
"You might actually be on to something by saying it's all a little too perfect."

<Akasaka>
"...Meaning?"

<Ooishi>
"The truth is, I heard a little something from a friend of mine in the 4th Division.
 Where Oryou Sonozaki referenced the kidnapping of the Minister's grandson."

<Akasaka>
"She referenced it?"

<Ooishi>
"'It's been several days since the Minister's grandson has been kidnapped. Poor boy.
 It'd be nice if they let him go soon.'
 It seems that Old Oryou muttered something like that while on her veranda. 

<Ooishi>
And, that little musing was conveyed to the various people working deep behind the scenes at the Sonozaki family."
Right, I had heard something earlier from Sato-san, the informant.
That when the leader Oryou had a 'concern,' somebody in the family would be 'considerate.'

<Akasaka>
"So... in essence, she gave the order to release the hostage?"

<Ooishi>
"I see it that way.
 The wallet being conveniently discovered was just a ploy to hand the boy over to the police."

<Akasaka>
"...Why would they release the hostage?"

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha!
 Well, there's only one reason why somebody would release a hostage, isn't there?"

<Akasaka>
"What is it?"

<Ooishi>
"They reached a deal.
 That would mean the Minister promised to halt the Hinamizawa Dam Project."

<Rika>
"...The dam project will definitely go away."
At that moment, those words that the girl had said resurfaced in the back of my mind.
...In the end, it was turning out exactly as she had proclaimed.
That young girl knew the circumstances.
She knew everything about this kidnapping incident, from the beginning to the end.

<Rika>
"...Akasaka."
The girl unexpectedly called my name.

<Akasaka>
"...What is it?"

<Rika>
"...Go back to Tokyo."
Huh...?

<Rika>
"...Before long, you will woefully regret coming to this village.

<Rika>
That would be an incredibly pathetic thing to see.
 ...So I thought I'd warn you right now."

<Akasaka>
"...Why...would I come to regret it?"

<Rika>
"...Stop whining.

<Rika>
...When you tried crossing the road when the Don't Walk sign was up,
 did your parents finish explaining why it was dangerous before pulling you back to the sidewalk?
 They'd pull you back right away, wouldn't they? 

<Rika>
They'd pull you back before explaining why it was dangerous, wouldn't they?
 ...In other words, it's something like that."
...The girl, who knew everything from start to finish, had warned me in the beginning. Go back to Tokyo.

<Rika>
"...Akasaka is such a coward.
 ...Tee hee hee hee hee...!"

<Ooishi>
"We'll probably find the boy... but what happens afterwards will probably be a bit of a problem.
 How it'll be a problem though, is something a single officer like me can't figure out."

<Akasaka>
"Do you know...
 a girl named Rika Furude?"
What I had said was such a non sequitur that Ooishi sat in stunned silence for a while.

<Ooishi>
"...Of course I know her.
 She's the only daughter of the Furude family, one of the Three Families."

<Akasaka>
"What kind of girl is she?"

<Ooishi>
"...Well well.
 This was an unexpected name to hear. I'm a bit surprised.
 Does Public Safety think that the Furude family smells fishy and wants to keep an eye on them? 

<Ooishi>
Share some of that information with me, please."

<Akasaka>
"Ah... no. It's not like that.
 ...It's just... something that caught my attention."

<Ooishi>
"....Hmmm?
 Na ha ha ha, well whatever.
 It wouldn't do to not answer a question from a friend I've sat at the same table with."

<Akasaka>
"...I'm honored that you call me a friend."

<Ooishi>
"Nfu fu!
 So, that little lady is, well, somewhat of a village mascot.
 She's beloved by everybody in the village.
 Some of the older folk worship her especially."

<Akasaka>
"Worship?"

<Ooishi>
"Hmmm, I don't know much about it, you see.
 Girls born in the Furude family have somewhat of a sacred implication, it seems.
 It's one of the local beliefs in Hinamizawa. 

<Ooishi>
The living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama or something like it, or so the story goes, apparently."

<Akasaka>
"Oyashiro-sama...?
 ...Now that you mention it, I think I saw 'Oyashiro-sama' written on some of the Alliance's banners.
 ...What is Oyashiro-sama, exactly?"

<Ooishi>
"Ahh, it's the name of the guardian deity of Hinamizawa.
 They believe it'll exact punishment on those who would do ill towards the village. 

<Ooishi>
Well, if there was such a convenient god around, the guys at the dam would have long since been done in by divine justice.
 Luckily, nothing like that has happened to anybody just yet."

<Akasaka>
"The grandson of the Minister who trifled with the village, as a result of Oyashiro-sama's anger, was... hmm... what did they call it again?
 Oh, right. 'Onikakushi.'
 The Minister's grandson was demoned away. 

<Akasaka>
...That would probably be how the script is being written."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha!
 I see.
 It probably would turn into something like that."

<Akasaka>
"Divine punishment wrought by Oyashiro-sama.
 Then, the culprit is the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama...
 ...that girl...?"

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha ha ha!"
Even I didn't know exactly what I was saying, the fact that Ooishi laughed it off was a bit of a relief.
Ooishi's joyous laughter was so infectious that I began to laugh like an idiot as well.

<Ooishi>
"...Oh.
 This is unusual."
Ooishi, after laying into the horn several times, rolled the window down and leaned out, waving his arm in an exaggerated manner.
It was a car headed the opposite way.
Until now, we hadn't run into any other cars except our own.
And of all places, it was at this desolate location.
It seemed that Ooishi knew the owner of that car.
The other car also chirped its horn, and came to a stop.

<Ooishi>
"Dr. Irie~~~!!!
 Good afternoon."
The other car's window rolled down slowly, revealing a young man in a white overcoat.
He was about my age, or perhaps a bit older.
 ...But you really can't judge somebody by their appearance.

<Young Doctor>
"Why, if it isn't Ooishi-san.
 Good afternoon.
 ...Ha haha, fancy meeting you here."

<Ooishi>
"That's my line, doctor.
 I never thought I'd see you here, nfu fu fu!
 What happened?"

<Young Doctor>
"Oh nothing, just a little house call."

<Ooishi>
"...Oh, really?
 Was it an emergency?"

<Young Doctor>
"No... nothing quite that serious.
 Thankfully."

<Ooishi>
"It's always for the best when the patient gets better without the need of medical care.
 Nfufufu...!"

<Young Doctor>
"I'll take my leave here.
 ...If I don't get back quickly, my staff will be angry with me."

<Ooishi>
"Nahaha!
 Being the head of a clinic must be tough.
 Well then, take care!"
The young doctor named Irie, after gesturing his farewell, drove forwards and soon disappeared around a corner.
Ooishi also drove forwards, but soon came to a stop again.
He pulled out a worn mapbook from the dash.
His expression didn't have an ounce of irreverence; he was perfectly serious.

<Akasaka>
"...What is it?"

<Ooishi>
"The clinic shouldn't be making any house calls today.
 It must have been quite an emergency, or otherwise a patient with some extenuating circumstances."
Ooishi flipped through the pages, opening up to the map of Takatsudo. After that, he took a look around and started to figure out what our current location was.

<Akasaka>
"...Are you saying that emergency is suspicious?"

<Ooishi>
"Didn't I say?
 There's hardly anybody that lives in the Takatsudo area.
 ...The road we're on right now is here.
 Dr. Irie came from this direction."

<Akasaka>
"..."
Having no sense of our surroundings, I couldn't digest anything about the place he was indicating on the map.

<Ooishi>
"We're heading towards the spot where the wallet was found.
 By the way, that's over here.
 But see?
 If you're heading to one of the few residences in Takatsudo, it's the wrong road."

<Akasaka>
"...Meaning, Dr. Irie came from a direction where there are no residents?"

<Ooishi>
"As long as somebody working in the fields between these mountains didn't collapse.
 But if somebody collapses and you call a doctor, normally you'd bring them back with you for a more detailed examination.

<Ooishi>
But just now, Dr. Irie said it was nothing serious.
 And it didn't seem like anybody else was in the car with him."
Ooishi didn't say any more than that.
I also said nothing more.
That doctor just now, examined a patient.
 Close by.
 Only that.
The noisy radio had suddenly gone quiet.
The sky had just as suddenly turned an oppressive color.
...As Ooishi mused that it might start to rain, a torrential downpour started, as though trying not to disappoint him.
Eventually, Ooishi stopped the car.
The only sounds to break the silence were the percussion of the rain on the roof and the soft squeak of the windshield wipers.

<Ooishi>
"...Let's do this a bit hush-hush, shall we?"
Saying that in a quiet voice, he exited the car without an umbrella, careful not to make any noise.
Ooishi leaned over, indicating the other side of the thicket.
He was pointing to a prefabricated shed and a car that was parked beside it.
The car looked obviously well-cared-for--it wasn't a vehicle that had been left there for several years.

<Akasaka>
"...What's that shed?"

<Ooishi>
"It contains equipment used by the forestry service.
 I heard that they don't go near it except during the summertime."

<Akasaka>
"Does that car belong to somebody from the forestry service, then?"

<Ooishi>
"Dunno.
 It doesn't look like an official vehicle though."
Ooishi was playing it cool, but my nervousness was gradually increasing.

<Ooishi>
"Just in case."
Saying that, Ooishi returned to the car.
I thought he was going to get an umbrella, but he had grabbed the onboard radio instead.

<Ooishi>
"Hello, this is Ooishi.
 Do you read?
 Greetings, greetings, nfu fu."

<Okinomiya PS>
"Yes, this is the Okinomiya PS.
 Ooishi-san, we read you loud and clear, over."

<Ooishi>
"I'm currently in front of the forestry service's equipment shed.
 Not the one in the direction of Yagouchi, the one in Takatsudo, if you head there from Hinamizawa."

<Okinomiya PS>
"...Affirmative, copy that."

<Ooishi>
"There're some suspicious people in the shed.
 Proceeding to investigate. 

<Ooishi>
If you don't hear back from me in five minutes, get in touch with the local police substation and have them send a cruiser as soon as possible.
 If you would, please."

<Okinomiya PS>
"Understood."

<Ooishi>
"Well then... shall we go take a look?
 Nfu fu fu!"
Since he was first confined here, he had heard the sound of a car multiple times.
So he just thought the far-off sound was more of the same.
However, the reaction from his captors was, until now, something he hadn't seen before.
They jumped, reacting as if shocked by a jolt of electricity, and pressed against the window, cautiously peering outside.

<Kidnapper>
"...They stopped."

<Kidnapper>
"...Somebody from the forestry service?
 This is bad."

<Kidnapper>
"...Nah... looks like a cop ta me."
One of the captors lifted the boy by his collar and pressed a blade against his cheek.

<Kidnapper>
"Hey kid, keep quiet for a bit.
 I think you know this, but if you try and shout, there'll be problems..."
Toshiki Inukai was sure that the doctor had reported things to the police.
He had felt relief when he thought that he was saved. But not imagining that his captors would resort to violence when they were cornered, his anxiety remained unabated.

<Kidnapper>
"What do we do?"

<Kidnapper>
"...Gotta buy time.
 Take tha kid, and slip outta tha back.
 We'll meet back 'ere when tha heat's off."
One of the perpetrators grabbed the boy by the collar and forced him to stand.
Of course, Toshiki Inukai tried to resist by feigning that his illness had been aggravated by this rough treatment, but his captors paid no heed.
BANG BANG BANG!!!
The door was violently banged upon.

<Ooishi>
"Excuse me~~!!
 Hello~~~!!!"
BANG BANG BANG, BANG!!
The door was banged on again.
Toshiki Inukai hesitated for a moment to respond to that voice by yelling.
However, while he was being indecisive, his mouth was covered, taking that option away from him.
The leader of the captors waved at the other to go.
The younger perpetrator nodded in response, and while keeping the boy's mouth covered, started heading towards the back door.

<Kidnapper>
"Yello~~ d'ya need somethin'?"

<Ooishi>
"How do you do?
 This is the police, would you mind opening the door?
 Nfu fu fu!
 This sudden rain has us in a bit of trouble."

<Kidnapper>
"Uhhhh.
 I'll jes' ope--"
The moment the lock was undone, Ooishi forced the door open.
And with a gleam of menace in his eyes, he pushed the man aside as he stepped into the room.
Then, in the small and empty room, he was able to quickly discern that the boy he was looking for was nowhere to be seen.

<Ooishi>
"Hmm?
 I heard this was an equipment shed for the forestry service.
 But there's nothing here at all."
There was nothing inside the room that would indicate this was an equipment shed.
There was only a mountain of blankets, indicating that somebody was sleeping here, alongside empty food packets strewn about.

<Kidnapper>
"...Aah, 's been empty fer some time now.
 Never seen no equipmen' stored 'round 'ere."

<Ooishi>
"But this is the forestry service's building, isn't it?
 Are you from the forestry service?"

<Kidnapper>
"...'Ow 'bout ya? Police?"
The two of them glared at each other suspiciously.
...Both Ooishi and the man steadfastly refused to reveal their identity before the other did.
The man, judging from the sharp look in Ooishi's eyes, realized that it would be hard to talk his way out of this one.
No matter what he said, the most time he could buy would probably be only a few dozen seconds.
Only the sound of rain filled this tense moment.
Just then, they heard the sound of a struggle from far off.
Ooishi had a hunch.
There was no doubt that Akasaka, who was circling around back, had run into the perpetrators who were trying to slip away!
As Ooishi thought that, the man in front of him reacted a moment faster.
The man swung with an attack that was more intended to obscure Ooishi's vision rather than actually hit him in the face.
Seizing his opportunity, the man aimed a kick at Ooishi's groin without any hesitation.
...But he missed his mark and was unable to land that critical blow.
The man, trying to pin Ooishi, grabbed him by the base of his neck with both hands and fiercely tried to push him down.
But, as Ooishi fell backwards, as if kicking the man upward, he dug his foot into the man's midsection.
With that leg acting as a fulcrum, the man was flung by the falling Ooishi as if by a circle throw.
The two of them squared off in the pouring rain.

<Ooishi>
"Isn't this interesting.
 You wanna go!?
 Naahahahahaha!!"
Ooishi, as if trying to cheer himself on, grinned smugly.
He then stood up while brushing the mud off himself.
Even though he countered the assault, Ooishi was getting up rather awkwardly compared to the man who he threw, who swiftly sprang to his feet.

<Akasaka>
"Ooishi-saaaaan!!
 Hurry!!"
Akasaka's voice rang out from the distance.
Judging from the distress in his voice, he was already engaged in a fight, and wanted Ooishi to reconvene with him.
But Ooishi's hands were full as well.

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-saaan!
 Sorry, but can you wait a bit!?"
The man raised both fists into a stance that hinted at him being acquainted with karate or some other form of martial art.
Of course Ooishi, as an officer of the law, was decently versed in judo.
He also had the moxie to have been through his fair share of fights before.
Despite-- no, because of that, he could tell that the man in front of him was quite a bit better at fighting than he was.
...Ahh, dammit!
 Thinking that this was going to be easy just because the order came from the Sonozaki family to release the hostage had been a big mistake!

<Ooishi>
"You're pretty good.
 It's been a while since I got this worked up.
 Nfu fu fu!"
Ooishi played off the situation like it was no sweat.
His opponent, seeing his attitude, took that to mean that Ooishi wasn't going to go down easily.
The man wildly charged forward, attempting to grab Ooishi!
If the man managed a successful clinch from his low stance, Ooishi would be tackled to the ground and end up being mounted.
It was something you saw often when children fought, but it really was a bad position, since you couldn't do much once you were in it.
Ooishi, responding to that move, also lowered his stance to collide with the man head on.
The moment they clashed, Ooishi grabbed the man's lapel!
As he yanked the lapel upwards, he smashed into the man's solar plexus with the elbow of the same arm.
 It was a move from Ooishi's own personal brand of brawling judo.
He then grabbed on with his free hand and attempted to throw his opponent with both hands!
But the man lowered his center of gravity and swung his arms in a large arc, entwining them with Ooishi's.
Not only that, but he had forced both of Ooishi's elbows to the outside, and Ooishi, now in an awkward position, was in danger of exposing his back with his hands still clutching the man's chest!
This guy... practiced aikido or grappling, didn't he!?
Ooishi, cursing the fact that his fingers were twisted into the man's shirt and couldn't get away, released his grip.
But he was still in the awkward position of being bent over.
 And to top it off, at zero range!
The man was able to read Ooishi's movements completely as he tried to squirm his way into a better position.
And then, took the palms of his hands...
 and swiftly clapped them over both of Ooishi's ears.

<Ooishi>
"Arghhh!!!"
Clapping the ears in any other martial art, except for self-defense, was basically forbidden.
Karate and judo didn't recognize it as a legal technique.
It was that much of a simple--and dangerous--attack!
Ooishi raised both his hands as he tried to reflexively clutch at his own ears.
But before that could happen, the man wrapped his arms around Ooishi's neck.
His thick biceps clenched firmly around the base of Ooishi's neck like a vise.
Ooishi instinctively thought he was going to be killed.
After all, it wasn't hard to believe that a man like this, who was accustomed to fighting, could crush his opponent's neck from this position.
But his opponent didn't do that; he had chosen to keep his hold and force Ooishi to lose consciousness.
That's why Ooishi, at that moment, even though his face was twitching, was grinning widely.
Even though his opponent had a chance to kill him, he didn't choose to.
He was thinking:
 "Ahh, this guy has no intention of killing me."
However, even though that might be the case, the man's hold on his neck was by no means gentle.
In no time at all, Ooishi's consciousness began to fade.
Having the experience of being taken down countless times in judo during his student days, Ooishi was utterly resigned to the fact that it was over.
Akasaka was finally recovering from the intense pain of being kicked in a rather sensitive area.
He had bumped into the captor carrying the boy by the back entrance.
He had seen Toshiki Inukai's picture plenty of times, but wasn't able to immediately ascertain if the boy in front of him was the real deal, with his mouth covered in packing tape.
Also, with his limited experience, it wasn't hard for him to panic over how to deal with the situation.
Of course, the perpetrator didn't overlook this momentary lapse.
His kick landed squarely in a critical spot, with Akasaka not even having time to call for help.
As the man flung the boy over his shoulder, he headed towards the front of the shed.
But upon hearing Ooishi's bellowing voice, he gave up on going that direction.
He then dashed off towards the forest.
As if the weight of the boy slung over his shoulder wasn't even there.
Akasaka was lost for a moment.
Meeting up with Ooishi, who was fighting with the enemy, was by far the safer option.
But, he couldn't just lose sight of the fleeing man!
Akasaka stood up and chased after the captor's back.
He ran through a short thicket, branches and fallen leaves crunching underfoot.
The tips of branches raked and clawed at him, small scratches inscribing themselves on his body one after another.
He kept on stepping into puddles and mud, and his shoes were soon filled with murky water.
For Akasaka, travelling through this unexplored forest was, even though this was an emergency situation, extremely unpleasant.

<Akasaka>
"Stooooop!!
 This is the police!!"
As he said that, he regretted it immediately, as it was but a waste of breath.
There wasn't a thief in the world that would politely stop when told to by the police.
To a city boy like Akasaka, running through this forest was an arduous task...
 however, it must have been no easy task either for the man carrying the minister's grandson.
He neither gained nor lost ground in his pursuit.
Akasaka, upon realizing that, gained back a bit of composure.
Just keep on chasing him.
We are running in the same conditions.
 In fact, the man running with an awkward stride was at far more of a disadvantage.
They couldn't run forever.
 Eventually, he'd definitely trip and fall!
As long as he was being hounded, he would definitely stumble!!
And soon, his wish was fulfilled.

<Kidnapper>
"...Whoa!!"
The man, who had stepped in something and lost his balance, was no longer able to bear the weight of the boy, dropping him.
Akasaka, in all honesty, didn't care about the perpetrator at all.
Just as long as he could ensure the safety of Toshiki Inukai.
So if the perpetrator ran off by himself, it was perfectly acceptable.
...But it seemed that Toshiki Inukai was important to the man as well, and didn't choose to just run away empty-handed.
Akasaka didn't know what to do in this kind of situation.
His first priority should probably be to ensure the safety of the boy, subduing his captor being less important.
Grappling with the perpetrator wasn't something he planned on.
But most likely, it was either do or die.
Akasaka's moment of indecision proved to be fatal.
The man, aiming right between, or rather, for both of Akasaka's eyes, struck out with a jab.
Not wanting that, Akasaka raised both his hands to shield his face. At that moment, the man kicked at his unguarded midsection.
The pain almost felt like his vital organs were being squeezed out of his body, but he latched onto his opponent's leg.
But his opponent didn't hesitate one bit.
Leading with his seized foot, the man jumped at Akasaka, applying pressure and pushing him down.
Akasaka was unable to withstand that and fell, but under no circumstances was he letting that leg go.
The two men fell together in a tangled heap.
The man was desperate to pull his leg free from Akasaka, but having fallen in an awkward position, was unable to.
The two of them rolled around on the ground, floundering about trying to gain an advantage.
But Akasaka, who was holding onto his opponent's knee with both hands, and that opponent, who had complete freedom to move his upper body, were in two completely different situations.
The man gained a positional advantage on Akasaka, who was still latched onto his leg and couldn't move away, and pounded full force on his head with both his fists.
Not only that, he found a rock nearby and beat it against Akasaka's skull!
THWACK!
 THWACK!
 THWACK!!!

The difference between being hit with a fist and being hit with a rock was vast!!
Akasaka quickly thought of letting go of the man's leg to free his hands to protect his head.
But... if he let go here, the man would get away!
If he didn't dig in here, everything would be for naught.
The boy he was trying to save was right there.
He was going to save him and go back to Tokyo!!
If he could do that, then it was goodbye to this freakish village!
BAM!!
 CRACK!!
 THUD!!!

Without looking, I could tell my forehead had split open and was gushing blood.
But, I didn't let go of the man's leg.
 How could I? I won't let go!
When the man realized that no matter how much he beat my head he wasn't getting away, he used both his hands to grab my throat as if to crush my windpipe.
I pulled my head back as a slight form of resistance, but it was of no use.
The man's hands enveloped my neck, and began to crush it like a vise!
It was less about the pain of not being able to breathe, so much as it was choking so hard I felt like I was going to throw up.
It felt like my stomach was going to turn itself inside-out!!
 But I could only endure it!
...Dammitdammitdammit!!!
My throat...h-h-hurts!!
I won't let go, I can't let go!!
I didn't want to be here.
I wanted to resolve this, and go back to Tokyo!
 Go back to Tokyo,
 and talk to Yukie,
 all about our unborn child...
 We were going to talk about our bright future!!
I had no intention of loosening my grip.
 ...However, it loosened just a bit, and the man's leg came free.
The man kicked as hard as possible, and I tumbled backwards.

My head was spinning, and I was unable to get up right away.
 ...No, I couldn't even put any strength into getting up in the first place.
Even so, I couldn't back down!!!
If I let him escape now, this chance would never come again!!
Even just catching their scent was nothing short of a miracle.
If we weren't able to get the Minister's grandson back here, there wouldn't be another chance.
The man tried to drag the boy to his feet, but the kid was displaying some unexpected resistance, allowing me to get up unnoticed.
I grasped the rock the man had just beat me over the head with.
 ...Now it's my turn!!

<Akasaka>
"Yaaaaarrrrrrggghh!!!"
The rock should be able to supplement what meager strength I had left... adding more than enough power to my attack!!
My fist, still wrapped around the rock, dug into the side of the man's torso.
 It seems like it hurt him quite a bit.

<Kidnapper>
"...Ugh...
 Gah!!!"
The man rolled around for a bit, clutching his side.
Freed from the man's grip, the boy hid behind me.

<Akasaka>
"Toshiki Inukai-kun, right!?
 I've come to help you!!"
To the boy, those were the words he was waiting for the most!
But, the crisis was still not over.
That was because even though he was still clutching at his side, the man had gotten up again, and had taken a fighting stance.
I could see in the man's eyes the resentment at the pain I had caused him, and the confidence that he could still beat me.
If we were to clash head-on again, he might not even stop if my head were split open.

<Akasaka>
"Stop resisting!!
 Surrender quietly!!"

<Kidnapper>
"You should just hand the boy over!!
 Do you want me to snap your neck!?"

<Akasaka>
"Who would listen to you now!?
 Reinforcements are already on their way!
 There's nowhere for you to run!!"
The man reacted adversely to the word "reinforcements."
That was because he now knew that arguing like this wasn't just waste of time, but put him closer and closer to danger.
Realizing that, the man shifted mental gears almost too quickly.

<Kidnapper>
"Then let's finish this fast!!
 How about this...!!"

<Akasaka>
"...Wha!?"
What the man pulled from his back pocket was of all things, a gun!
Of course, I'm a police officer.
It's not like I don't know what a gun is.
But having one pointed at me was something I'd never experienced before.
Was it... real?
Of course it was!!
 There's no way it'd be a replica in a situation like this!!

<Kidnapper>
"Put both your hands behind your head and lay down quietly!!"

<Akasaka>
"Don't get cocky, you villain!!
 I won't do anything you say!!"

<Kidnapper>
"You stupid idiot!!
 Do you not know what this is without me shooting you with it!?"

<Akasaka>
"Then shoot!
 Reinforcements will hear the gunshot and head right over here!!"

<Kidnapper>
"Are you stupid!?
 We're in the middle of the forest, and on top of that, it's raining!!
 They'll never hear a thing!!"
As long as he still held that gun, no matter how much I yelled at him, I was at a distinct disadvantage.
But, I still had a fighting chance.
If I were in his shoes, instead of wasting time yelling at each other like this, I would just shoot him and take the boy.
That way was the fastest, and would suppress any sort of further resistance from him.
But the man was demanding my surrender, without having fired a shot.
Meaning that he either didn't want to shoot, or couldn't.
 ...In other words, the man in front of me was soft!
If I could buy even just a little more time, the factors that would lead to my victory were numerous.
Ooishi was probably on his way, and the reinforcements we called for before coming here should already be well on their way too.
Not only that, they should have contacted the local police box.
Without a doubt, somebody stationed in the village would be here much quicker than that!

<Kidnapper>
"...Dammit...!!
 Do I have to put a bullet in you to understand how dangerous this thing is!?"

<Akasaka>
"There's no escape!!
 Don't add to your crimes!!"
At that moment, I heard the rustling of foliage and heavy footsteps approaching.
If Ooishi was coming here, it was a whole new ball game.
The man couldn't have more than one gun!

<Akasaka>
"Ooishi-san!!
 Over here!! Over here!!!
 ...Huh!?"
I had thought that time was on my side.
But I had failed to even imagine that the enemy could also have reinforcements!!
You could tell the man who had just appeared was one of the perpetrators just by looking at him.

<Kidnapper>
"Whaddya doin'...
 If ya don' hurry up, the police'll get 'ere!
 Stop lollygaggin'!!"

<Akasaka>
"...Dammit...!!
 What happened to Ooishi-san!?"

<Kidnapper>
"Aah, tha' chubby fella?
 E's down fer tha count.
 Eee hee hee!"

<Akasaka>
"He is!?
 ....Dammit...!!"
The boy, sensitive to the impending danger, curled up behind my back.
...How could this be...dammit!!

<Kidnapper>
"Your buddy isn't coming!!
 Serves you right!!
 Shoe's on the other foot now!!"
As I backed up against a large tree while still protecting the boy, the second man also pulled out a gun.

<Kidnapper>
"Won' be sayin' this twice.
 Put yer 'ands on yer 'ead and lie down."

<Akasaka>
"I refuse!!!"
BANG!

As I shouted in protest, blood erupted from my left shoulder. It took a few moments to register that I had been shot!
Compared to the ones from in movies and TV dramas, the first actual gunshot I heard was simple and mundane.
In fact, the sound was more akin to the small fireworks I used to buy from the corner store as a kid.
But there was no comparing the pain...
 It was a fear you knew only after you've been shot.

<Akasaka>
"..Ah... gh... nghh...!!!"

<Toshiki>
"...S-Sir!?
 Are you okay!?
 Are you okay!!?"
The boy, in his confusion, tugged at my clothes, agitating the wound even further.
I wanted to put on a bold face and reassure him, but my voice was hoarse and had the opposite effect.

<Akasaka>
"I-I'm all right!!
 I've already called for backup.
 There'll be a full squad here soon!
 ...Gah...!"

<Kidnapper>
"It'll be quicker ta put one thru yer 'ead afore the cops get 'ere.
 But tha family said no needless killin', so I'm taking it easy on ya.
 Don' mess with me, or I ain't 'oldin' back."
...This was bad.
 ...It was very very bad.
This second man was a completely different beast than the first!
 He had no signs of indecisiveness or mercy!!
If this man said he'd shoot, he'd shoot!
He wasn't somebody that a man like me could buy time from!!
I really hated to admit it, but at that moment, the image of Yukie's smiling face crossed the back of my mind.
I knew what that meant.
I was warning myself to not throw my life away over a matter of pride.
Of course I didn't want to die here!
I was just starting a new life with Yukie, and I wanted to see the face of our soon-to-be-born child!!
Why should I risk my life for some Minister's grandson when I was at such a critical juncture in my own life!!!
...Arrghh! Dammit! Dammit!!
I need to stop rambling at myself!
 So what do I do now!?
 Give up the boy and extend my own life!?
 What a good idea!!
 Everybody's life is precious!!
 My own life was in danger!!
 Nobody would blame me!!!
Arghh, goddammit... it hurts... it hurts...!!!
If I had known it would be this painful, I wouldn't have played the tough guy!!
My biggest miscalculation though, was that the sound of the gunshot was far quieter than I had imagined.
If it was only that loud, it would be drowned out by the rain in the forest!
It wasn't something that somebody far away could hear!!



[Himatsubushi Ch.7-1]


<Akasaka>
"Dammit!!
 Wait, just wait!!
 I don't want to die!!!"

<Kidnapper>
"Aah, and I don' wanna kill ya!!
 'Slong as ya unnerstand!!"

<Akasaka>
"Don't shoot, okay!?
 Don't shoot!!
 I have a wife waiting for me at home!!
 I don't want to die!!!"

<Kidnapper>
"I won' shoot 'slong as ya don' yell or nuthin' !
 Jes quietly put yer 'ands on yer 'ead and lie down!!"

<Akasaka>
"Will you really!?
 Will you really!?!?
 You'll keep your promise, right!?
 This is a promise between men!!"

<Kidnapper>
"I will!!
 'S a promise between men!!"

<Akasaka>
"Keep your promise! Keep it!!!
 I'm going to get down on the ground, okay?
 I'm getting down!
 I'll keep my promise, so stop pointing that gun at me!!
 You're still thinking of shooting me, aren't you!? 

<Akasaka>
You want to shoot me, don't you!?
 When I get down on the ground, you're just going to shoot me in the back of the head, aren't you!?!?"

<Kidnapper>
"I won', I won'!!
 Fine!!
 I'll put it away!
 I'll put tha gun away!!
 'S a promise between men!!
 ...There!!
 No problem now, righ'!?!?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, absolutely no complaints!!!"

<Kidnapper>
"Gah!
 Ugghhhaaa!!!"
It was over in a flash.
The moment he lowered his gun, Ooishi didn't let his chance slip by!
Ooishi had been assessing the situation for quite some time from behind the two men.
But since they had their guns trained on me, he didn't really have a chance to jump in.
Seeing the look on Ooishi's face indicating that he wanted me to create an opening, I took on that role completely.
Ooishi forcefully lifted the arm that was holding the gun.
He then took the gun from the man's hand in only an instant!
The other man, who was a bit slow in grasping what was happening, pointed his gun at them, but with his ally grappling with Ooishi, he couldn't pull the trigger.
If that man was the one that was wrestling with Ooishi at the moment, he might have shot without hesitation.
But this man wouldn't shoot.
 He couldn't shoot!!
Ooishi kicked the other man away, and while aiming the stolen gun with his left hand, pulled out his own.
With guns akimbo, he was aiming at both men at the same time!

<Ooishi>
"I do believe that's checkmate!!"
It was perfectly played.
But, heedless of the guns pointed at them, the men shouted "Scram!!" as they scattered away at full speed.
It was over in an instant.
Those two running away without putting up a fight was honestly unexpected.
Ooishi, quietly clicking his tongue in admonishment, slipped both guns into his pants pockets.

<Ooishi>
"Tsk.
 Those guys know their stuff..."

<Akasaka>
"...?
 What do you mean?"

<Ooishi>
"An officer won't fire at somebody who's fleeing.
 I want to keep my pension here."
Ooishi and I grinned at each other.

<Ooishi>
"Are you Toshiki Inukai-kun?
 The grandson of the Minister of Construction, Inukai?"

<Toshiki>
"Y... Yes...!"

<Ooishi>
"...This is going to be a major incident.
 We probably only cut the tail off the lizard though.
 Nfu fu fu."
Ooishi smiled amusedly.
The fact that the Onigafuchi Guardians (or rather, the Sonozaki family behind them) was pulling the strings was apparent, but proving it wouldn't be easy.
And, with apologies to Ooishi, this incident was unlikely to go public.
If this caused an uproar, it would obviously lead to the Minister losing his office.
With HQ having decided that doing so was in the national interest, this would probably be cleaned up quietly.
It might be a rough way of saying it, but this was born in the shadows, and was going to die in the shadows.
...Ooishi probably already understood the implications behind this incident.

<Ooishi>
"For the time being, let's cordon off the area,
 since it seems that one of them still has a gun.
 After that, let's get Inukai-kun to safety and get you to the hospital."
As the tension in the situation faded, the pain from the gunshot wound in my shoulder blossomed once again.
My forehead was also stinging painfully, and had grown hot enough to start a fire.
Thinking that the tension had caused me to sweat, I wiped my forehead, but what came off was a large amount of blood.
I realized that my shirt had been stained bright crimson from the blood flowing from my head.
I turned around.
...The boy was safe and sound.
 Without a doubt.
There would probably be an investigation on the men who ran, but that was for another day.
At this point in time, I could safely say we had cleared the major hurdle of securing the boy's safety.
As soon as I recognized that, it felt like the lights in my head had been hit by a power failure.
My knees buckled from underneath me, the ground there feeling as soft as a cloud.
It didn't feel unpleasant even as I was covered in the rain-soaked mud.
Ooishi came closer, asking if I was okay, but somehow I couldn't tell.
...I turned off the switch to the last light in my head.
The exhaustion enveloped me.
 Sleep.
 ...Something softer than any blanket wrapped around me...



[Himatsubushi Ch.8]

...That was my first time losing consciousness.
You often hear of regaining consciousness on top of a bed, but this was my first time actually experiencing it.

<Young Doctor>
"...Hello?
 Are you okay...?"
Realizing that I was awake, a young doctor called out to me.
I didn't intend to respond, but it seems my body language had told him I was conscious.
My head was wrapped in bandages.
The scratches all over my body had also been treated.
...My sense of pain also returned with my consciousness, causing me to groan from the intense pain shooting all throughout me.

<Young Doctor>
"Don't try to get up. Just stay lying down, please.
 It seems that you took quite a few blows to the head...
 I want you to stay rested so we can monitor your condition for at least the next 24 hours."

<Akasaka>
"...Where is this?"

<Young Doctor>
"This is my clinic.
 Pleased to meet you. My name is Irie."
...I remembered that this young doctor was the one in the car headed the opposite way earlier.

<Akasaka>
"...Is there,
 somebody here?
 ...Where's Ooishi-san?"

<Irie>
"Ah, I'll call him over.
 There's no smoking inside the clinic, so I had him smoke outside."
Dr. Irie left the room to go call Ooishi.
...The scenery outside the window was tinted with gold.
The pouring rain had stopped, with the voices of the higurashi heralding the cooling temperature.
I felt that the tone of the higurashi's voices was... comforting.
Eventually, I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer, which I reckoned to be Ooishi's.
 The fog that was enveloping my head slowly faded back to reality...
What had happened since then?
What had happened to the boy?
What about the reinforcements from Tokyo?
The door to the room flew open, allowing Dr. Irie and Ooishi to enter.

<Ooishi>
"So there's no serious damage, is there?"

<Irie>
"...I can't promise that.
 I assessed the wound to his head was dangerous the moment I saw it."

<Ooishi>
"Got it, got it.
 I want to have a little chat alone with him for a bit, would you mind?"

<Irie>
"...Yeah, go ahead. Call me if anything happens."
Ooishi, after basically forcing Dr. Irie outside, shut the door.

<Ooishi>
"How are you feeling?"

<Akasaka>
"...I did something I'm not used to, so I'm pretty banged up all over."

<Ooishi>
"Nahahaha..."
Ooishi brought over a folding chair that was leaning against the wall and sat down beside the bed.

<Akasaka>
"Were the perpetrators arrested?"

<Ooishi>
"Unfortunately, no.
 ...They've probably already fled the prefecture, or are being hidden by the villagers.
 Well, we won't let them get away.
 Nfu fu fu!"

<Akasaka>
"What about the Minister's grandson?"

<Ooishi>
"They're taking care of him at the station.
 But your colleagues from Tokyo are rather insistent that nothing can be recorded.
 Shige-chan doesn't like that too much. Na ha ha ha..."
The kidnapping was a confidential matter, so his custody was also probably being kept under wraps.
How the kidnapping of the Minister's grandson would be handled, how it would be covered up, treated like it never happened... would be handled by the brass.
...If this case ended without the nation going into an uproar about it, then our job had been done.
...The possibility that the Minister had negotiated with the perpetrators couldn't be ruled out.
...But something like that was no longer my concern.
 My role in this case was over.

<Akasaka>
"...Sorry for the trouble.
 ...You must think that Public Safety is a rather unseemly place, don't you?"

<Ooishi>
"No, no.
 We all work on the government's dime."
Ooishi laughed boisterously.
When we first met, I was somewhat prejudiced against Ooishi, but now that feeling was gone completely.

<Ooishi>
"It would be more convenient for us if this case was handled properly instead of being hidden away. 

<Ooishi>
If that happened we would be able to have something to go at the Sonozaki family with, since they were behind it all. 

<Ooishi>
Well, if we just start poking around we'll get all sorts of pressure put on us, though.
 ...What a mess."

<Akasaka>
"Are you going to continue the fight against the Sonozaki family after this?"

<Ooishi>
"Nah.
 There's all sorts of dark rumors swirling around them, but it's not like I have a personal grudge.
 It'd be wise not to step on any toes here.
 Na ha ha ha."
Ooishi laughed happily, and I couldn't help but laugh along.

<Ooishi>
"Oh, that's right.
 There was word at the station from the prefectural police.

<Ooishi>
Your colleagues arrived at Nagoya, and are driving up here right now.
 You've got your battle scars, so you're being recalled to Tokyo, apparently.

<Ooishi>
That's how it's shaking up. ....Good job.
 Your work in Okinomiya is safely over."
I was being recalled to Tokyo.
...I inadvertently breathed a sigh of relief when I heard those words.

<Akasaka>
"...I'm deeply thankful for your cooperation, Ooishi-san.
 ...It seems the collaboration fee I paid you didn't go to waste."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha ha!!
 ...I kind of meant that as a joke, though."
Ooishi took out his wallet, casually pulled out several large bills, and jammed them into the breast pocket of my shirt.

<Ooishi>
"This isn't a refund on the collaboration fee, you hear?
 This is just me gifting you a little spending money.
 The booze around here is pretty good.
 Use this to buy yourself a little souvenir."
Ooishi flashed me a grin.

<Ooishi>
"If your injuries turn out to not be too serious, call me before you head back to Tokyo, will you?
 The ol' man and Sato-san said they'd like to sit at a table with you again."

<Akasaka>
"...Oh my... ahahaha, can't refuse that."

<Ooishi>
"And no tricks this time.
 Just some plain ol' fun."

<Akasaka>
"They always say that.
 This world is done for if an active officer can cheat that blatantly."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha ha ha ha!
 It's not often that we meet someone who's more than a match for us.
 It's too bad you're going back to Tokyo."
When I heard the words "going back to Tokyo" from Ooishi, I was reminded once again that I was relieved from my duties.
Soon, Yukie would be giving birth.
It might still be possible to attend the delivery that I had at one time given up on.
When I thought that, the pain from my injuries became trivial. I wanted to hurry back to Tokyo and see Yukie at once.

<Ooishi>
"Can you pretend that your injuries are a bit more serious, and hang around Okinomiya for a bit?
 I can introduce you to a few nice places.
 Of course, I won't make you pay for everything.
 Na ha ha ha!"

<Akasaka>
"I'm terribly sorry, but I'll have to take a rain check on that.
 My wife is due to give birth any day now.
 I want to hurry back home."

<Ooishi>
"Oh my, oh my!
 I didn't know that!
 Then you shouldn't be hanging around here!
 You have to hurry back home."
For a while after that, Ooishi asked all sorts of questions about my wife, teasing and bantering with me.

<Ooishi>
"...Well then.
 How do you feel?
 Think you can get up?"

<Akasaka>
"Yeah, it's not so bad, thanks to you.
 I can get up and walk no problem."
I stood up and shuffled around for a bit, which seemed to amuse Ooishi.

<Ooishi>
"Nah, I just thought that you might not feel comfortable at a hospital in Hinamizawa.
 Dr. Irie said he wanted you to stay overnight. 

<Ooishi>
...But we still haven't caught the perpetrators.
 For the time being, this is enemy territory for you, after all."

<Akasaka>
"Are you saying this hospital isn't safe?"

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha.
 ...Well, Dr. Irie is somebody who's well-regarded in the community.
 I don't think anything will happen while you're here, but I'm more worried about your mental health."
...I had relaxed a bit now that things had progressed this far, but it was exactly as Ooishi had said.
When I realized that this was enemy territory, I suddenly felt uncomfortable.
With the only thing left for me to do was leaving, the chance that I would come to harm was logically fairly low.
But that didn't mean I was completely safe.

<Akasaka>
"...That's right.
 If I'm just going to be lying down, then doing it in a hotel bed won't be all that different."

<Ooishi>
"Right, right.
 I also think that's for the best."
At that moment, I caught a glimpse of the clock over Ooishi's shoulder.
It was the evening.
...The hours when I could call Yukie at the hospital were almost over.
I wanted to tell her as quickly as possible that I would soon be back at her side.

<Akasaka>
"I want to call Yukie at the hospital.
 Is there a public phone in the lobby?"

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha!!
 You newlyweds are all like this.
 If I recall correctly, there's one by the register.
 I'll be waiting here, so go ahead, go ahead."
Ooishi, laughing while saying that he was jealous, opened up the window, and pulled out a cigarette even though he was in a hospital room.
Appreciative at how considerate Ooishi was, I set out to the lobby to find the phone.
The lobby was just a short distance down the hallway from the hospital room.
I thought that this hospital was a bit too grand for a village like this, but of course, it was nothing compared to the general hospital Yukie was admitted to.
Running inside a hospital wasn't the best of manners, but calling hours would soon end, so I dashed over in a hurry.
There was nobody else in the lobby.
It may have been the evening, but there was nobody at the reception desk.
...Well, this might actually be lucky for me.
I wasn't planning to have a conversation to feel guilty about, but it would still be embarrassing to have someone listen to the conversation between me and Yukie.
Taking a quick look around, I soon found the payphone.
Digging around in my pockets, I grabbed a few coins.
I was calling Tokyo from here, so I would burn through this amount fairly quickly.
I picked up the receiver and inserted a coin, then dialed the number for Yukie's hospital, which I had completely memorized at this point.
Whirrr.
 Whirrr.
 Whirrrrrr.
The number for Yukie's hospital had a lot of eights and nines, so dialing it in inevitably took some time.
Normally, it wouldn't be a big deal, but currently, any time was precious.
...However, I felt that something was strange as I was dialing in the number.
I don't know exactly how to put it, but it was as if the receiver was too quiet.
That unique white noise from the telephone line wasn't there.

<Akasaka>
"...?"
Somehow, I felt that I wasn't getting any feedback from the phone, and without feeling a response, I hung up the receiver to try again.
The coin popped out from the return slot.
I reinserted the coin and began dialing once again, but the receiver was still dead silent.

<Akasaka>
"...What is this?
 ...Is it disconnected?"
While I was wasting time like this, the amount I had to spend talking with Yukie shrunk...
 I began to feel needlessly impatient.

<Akasaka>
"Excuse me~~~!"
I felt the presence of someone on the other side of the glass, so I called out.
There was an immediate response, and a man who seemed like a pharmacist came over.

<Man>
"Yes, how can I help you?"

<Akasaka>
"Pardon me.
 This phone seems to be acting a little strange.
 ...Could you take a look at it?"
The man came over, and tried testing various things with the receiver pressed to his ear.
...Come to think of it, this was someone who worked at the hospital, not someone from the phone company.
Just as I didn't know much about phones, neither would he.

<Man>
"...Huh?
 What's this...?"
The man held up the cord that connected the phone to the wall.
...It was completely severed.

<Man>
"What the heck is that?
 Well this is a dilly of a pickle...
 Can't do anything with this until somebody from the phone company comes and fixes it... 

<Man>
If you're looking for a phone, do you want to use the one in the office?"
I didn't want the people in the hospital office around while I was talking...

<Akasaka>
"Is there another payphone close by?"

<Man>
"Let's see... if you leave here and follow the road, you'll come out into the shopping district.
 I think there's a smoke shop on the corner around there. 

<Man>
If you head that way, you should be able to find one soon enough."
I was dressed in a hospital gown.
I was wearing sandals on my feet.
 My head was wrapped in bandages -- just looking at me, you could tell I was a hospital patient.
No matter how you looked at it, I was not dressed to be wandering outside.
 But that's where the impetuousness of youth came in.
Choosing the chance to talk to Yukie for even a little longer, I headed outside in my current state.
Follow the road to the shopping district.
Should be able to find one soon enough.
With only those two lines as my guide, I ran outside the gates of the hospital.
With the village nestled in a valley, when the sun set, it got dark quickly.
...The sparse streetlights lit up enough to start attracting moths.
The higurashi, knowing the time for their chorus was soon at a close, redoubled their fragile cries...
Finding the payphone wasn't as easy as the person at the hospital had suggested.
Was it still up ahead? Did I miss it already? Was I just getting farther away?
Just as I was about to be crushed by the wave of uncertainty towering over me, I found a shop on the corner with "Cigarettes" written on a small sign.
My joy spurred me onwards.
...Just as I had heard at the hospital, set next to the counter of the cigarette shop was an antiquated payphone.
I wasn't wearing a watch, so I didn't know what time it was... I probably didn't have much left, though.
But it was enough.
 Just as long as I could tell Yukie my job was done and I would be coming home soon.
Picking up the receiver, I slid a coin down the slot.
...But I felt that something was strange, just like at the hospital.
Even after inserting the coin, the phone showed no response.

<Akasaka>
"..."
I hung up the receiver and tried putting in the coin one more time.
 ...But there was absolutely no response.
This phone was dead.
It couldn't be...
Thinking that, I felt along the cord that protruded from the back of the phone.
...Doing that, my hands found the end of a completely severed line.
...What... is this?
Having now had the same thing happen twice, my bafflement was accompanied by a sense of unease.
It seemed that the cord had been severed cleanly by a sharp blade of some sort.
And I may be mistaken, but it didn't look like much time had passed since it was cut.

<Akasaka>
"Uhh... excuse me!
 Hello?"
Opening up the booth window of the tobacco shop, I looked for someone in the dimly lit interior.
Eventually, there were the sounds of somebody plodding down some stairs, and an old lady appeared.
The old lady's plodding and lethargic steps, for some reason, only served to make me more frantic.

<Old Woman>
"You need some cigarettes?
 I'll need to get my husband..."

<Akasaka>
"I'm not here to buy cigarettes.
 Rather, this phone here..."
Realizing that saying the phone was broken and asking them to take a look at it was going to get me nowhere, I swallowed back my words.

<Akasaka>
"Sorry, it seems that this phone is broken, and I was wondering if you could tell me where there's another payphone..."
The old lady moved her jaw up and down slowly as if chewing on the meaning of my words. It seemed that she wouldn't understand until she had digested things thoroughly.

<Old Woman>
"...So the phone is broken?
 That's a dilly of a pickle...
 You should try another payphone."
The old lady directed me to another payphone that seemed quite a ways away.
Her way of telling me was so long-winded, that I inadvertently started to get impatient.
At that moment, I spotted a clock in the dim interior of the store.
The minute hand was just about to point straight up.
Even if there was a phone right here that I could use, I would only be able to tell Yukie good night with the time I had left.
On top of that, my destination was a remote payphone which I didn't know the exact distance to.
..If I was of a normal state of mind, deciding to give up the phone today would have been the natural thought process.
But, at that moment, I had become somewhat... stubborn, for some reason.
Unable to use the phone in the hospital, and coming out here and still being unable to use one.
 ...There was no mistaking that I had become quite insistent on using a phone.

<Akasaka>
"Ah, thank you very much...
 I'll try looking for that phone booth."
Refusing her offer to draw me a map, I left the tobacco shop.
According to the old lady, even though the phone booth was quite far away, it would be easy to find.
If I just followed this road straight down, I'd eventually find it.
Sandals flapping as I ran, I couldn't help but laugh at myself.
I'll admit that I was quite steadfast about calling Yukie.
But there were days when I was tired or busy when I wouldn't call her.
Even today, my entire body was covered with injuries, and I was dead tired. On top of that, there wasn't much time left.
 ...It wouldn't be strange at all if today was one of those days I didn't call her.
But, having twice been foiled trying to call her, had I become hot-headed about it?
Was I like a dog who was being told to 'stay' with a piece of food dangled in my face?

<Akasaka>
"...What am I doing?
 ...Ahahaha."
Even so, I somehow couldn't quell the uneasy feeling sitting in the pit of my stomach.
It was like that with the hospital phone, and the same with the one at the tobacco shop.
Both cords were definitely not severed from being frayed by long years of use.
The clean cuts indicated that someone had taken something sharp and deliberately cut them.
But who? And for what reason?
The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I felt, so I tried to push the thought aside...
...How much had I run so far?
The scenery around me was no longer that of a shopping district, with residential buildings scattered about the lonely road.
The surroundings had already grown dark.
I was blatantly out too far for a quick phone call, and it was quite obvious I was far removed from the hospital.
I recalled the clock I saw at the tobacco shop.
 ...It might almost be time.
I had run for quite a bit, so my breathing had grown quite ragged.
...If I had just wanted to hear Yukie's voice, I should have just thrown away my reservations and borrowed the phone in the office.
 ...I regretted it a little.
Well then, was it about time to give up?
...Just when I thought that.
 I saw the light in front of me.
I had finally found it.
 It was a phone booth.
It seemed that the light in the phone booth had recently been changed, as it shone with a vivid white light.
Although in the gloom of Hinamizawa, it was nothing more than a gathering spot for moths.
But, in any case... I had finally found it!
As my hand touched the door of the phone booth, I realized that I was breathing and sweating heavily.
...I didn't know what time it was right now, but... even if it was just for a moment, I might be able to get in touch with Yukie.
Since I had spent all this effort getting here, turning back without even giving it a try was out of the question.
Before I picked up the receiver, another wave of uneasiness washed over me.
I was worried that this phone cord might be severed as well.
How was the cord in this phone booth?
Squatting down, I followed the bundle of cables as they ran along the corner into the ceiling.
At a glance... nothing was out of the ordinary.
I ran my fingers as far as I could along the line to check it out.
...The only thing they found was a thick layer of dust.
 Nothing out of the ordinary.

<Akasaka>
"..."
...I wondered if it was popular in Hinamizawa to cut the cords of payphones as some sort of tasteless prank.
It might be prudent to talk to Ooishi-san about this later.
Even if it was nothing more than a prank, it was still vandalism of public property.
...In any case, this one was fine... this time.
Pulling out a coin from my pocket with one hand, I picked up the receiver with the other.
...But this time, before the receiver even reached my ear, I felt something was off.
The receiver was... light.
...It was more than a slightly unpleasant feeling, it felt almost sickening.
To verify the source of my displeasure, I peered at the receiver in my hand with a measure of reluctance.

<Akasaka>
"...What the hell...is this?"
...The coiled cord that connected the receiver to the rest of the phone...
 ...had been ripped apart, the tip of the cable swaying in the air.
It was all I could do to restrain myself as a raw and unpleasant feeling worked its way up the small of my back.
 ...It was a type of dread.
At that moment, I heard the crunch of somebody stepping on gravel.
The light was reflecting off the glass walls of the booth, leaving me unable to see outside into the darkness.
I steeled myself, and stepped out of the phone booth.
The inside of the booth was lit with that strong light, which might have made it warmer in there.
Just stepping outside, I could feel a chill wash over me.
And there... was the silhouette of a person.
A small silhouette.

<Akasaka>
"...You're..."
The long hair of that silhouette was blown about by the cool breeze.

<Rika>
"...Injured people shouldn't be sneaking out of the hospital..."
Somewhere in my head, I knew who this girl was.
I didn't have any basis for it, but I knew that she was that girl.

<Rika>
"...Right, Akasaka?"
She, Rika Furude, said that almost like it was a warning...

<Akasaka>
"...Did you... do this to the phone cord...?"

<Rika>
"..."
Her expression remained unchanged, and my question was left unanswered.
In other words, no response.
Regardless, I felt that she had affirmed my suspicions.

<Akasaka>
"...Why would you do something like this?
 ...Why!?"
The last word had a tinge of anger behind it.
I frantically tried to smooth things out, but she didn't seem very afraid.

<Rika>
"...There's nothing that can be done."

<Akasaka>
"...Huh?"
I interpreted her words as meaning that I wasn't going to be in time for calling hours at the hospital.
...But, thinking about it, that would have been a strange thing to say.
Why would she know something like that?
I could take what she had said to have any other meaning.
She just stood there like a mannequin, not even moving an inch.
...Almost to the point that if the wind wasn't occasionally rustling through her long hair, there would be the illusion that time had stopped.

<Rika>
"...I know very well that you think I'm creepy, Akasaka."

<Akasaka>
"Huh...
 ...ah...
 ...no...
 ...that's not... true."
My denial came out almost like a bad piece composed for a poetry slam,
 but her words were right on the mark.
I had always felt something ominous and uncanny about her.
...Ever since her strange threats at the shrine.

<Rika>
"...Hee hee."
She had noticed that my expression was contrary to my words, seemingly laughing at the gap between them.

<Rika>
"...Akasaka,
 you coward.
 Tee hee hee..."

<Akasaka>
"I-I'm not a coward...!"
Being laughed at by this small child didn't sit well with me.
 So I said that.

<Rika>
"...Even if you find another phone, it's too late."

<Akasaka>
"...Sigh.
 ...That's right."
She didn't even have to say it.
I was absolutely too late.
I might have already missed calling hours even by the time I reached this phone booth.
I was too late. I had no option but to give up for today.
Once I decided that, my unhealthy obsession with phones suddenly faded.
...Even I thought that it was strange that I was that obsessed.
That strange obsession now gone, I began to laugh at how hopeless I was.
I mean, just look at what I was wearing... it wasn't normal.
A hospital gown and sandals.
My head wrapped in bandages, and my body completely soaked in sweat.
It was a wonder that the old lady at the tobacco shop wasn't surprised to see me.
With wanting to hear Yukie's voice as my motive, I had traipsed around the town the entire evening.
 ...I didn't know whether to call it the follies of youth, or simply plain embarrassing.
...In any case, it was all I could do but to laugh at myself.

<Rika>
"...Now.
 There's nothing left for Akasaka to do tonight."

<Akasaka>
"You're right. There's nothing.
 ...I'll just quietly return to the hospital."

<Rika>
"...That's fine.
 Do you know the way?"

<Akasaka>
"...I hope I do."
She waved her little hand as I began to head back the way I came.
She began to follow alongside me.
Looking at her face, I could see that she wore a mischievous smile.
...As if she was extremely interested in whether or not I would get lost.

<Akasaka>
"Is Rika-chan's house also this way...?"

<Rika>
"...It is."

<Akasaka>
"Won't your parents be mad that you're walking around alone at this hour?"

<Rika>
"Not really.
 My parents are busy today, so they probably forgot about me."

<Akasaka>
"...Even then, it's best if you head on home.
 They'll definitely be angry."

<Rika>
"...Even if they are, it's much more interesting to talk with Akasaka, so I'm fine."
She said that with a face free from worry as she looked up at me once more and smiled.
When she showed me that smile, ...the eerie feeling surrounding her faded.
...But even then, she was still as mysterious to me as ever.
We arrived at the corner I had turned at earlier.
...But it was much darker than before, and with the point of view changed on the return trip, I wasn't very confident that this actually was the corner I turned at.
There's no mistake... it had to be this corner.
As I began to move my feet again, the girl grabbed onto my clothes.

<Rika>
"...Isn't Akasaka going back to the hospital...?"

<Akasaka>
"Of course... at least, I intend to.
 ...Am I going the wrong way...?"
A short moment of silence.
Eventually, still holding onto my clothes, she began to walk.
It was the beginning of the walk to the hospital this mysterious girl would take me on.



[Himatsubushi Ch.9]


<Akasaka>
"...The person who was running around cutting all the phone cords was you, wasn't it, Rika-chan?
 You shouldn't do that any more."

<Rika>
"...I'm not sure what you're talking about."

<Akasaka>
"Really...?"
She tried to play dumb, but it was written all over her face.

<Rika>
"Nipaa~~...☆"
It was obvious she was trying to laugh it off, but that adorable smile of hers just made me want to forgive her.
...Ahhh... I'm going to be a horrible father, aren't I.
That momentary lapse in tension was erased by her next words.

<Rika>
"It's good that they found the grandson safe and sound."
Unable to respond right away, I sunk into silence.
...I had already learned this from Sato-san's info, didn't I.
This girl... no--this entire village, knew everything since the moment I set foot in it.
I considered playing dumb.
But in the end, I chose not to.
With everything being known already, there was no point in me feigning ignorance.

<Akasaka>
"...Somehow."

<Rika>
"That's great.
 ...Now you can go back to Tokyo."

<Akasaka>
"...Thank you."

<Rika>
"...Are your injuries bad, Akasaka?"

<Akasaka>
"Dunno... I haven't heard anything from the doctor yet, so I don't know if they are or not."
Huh?
 Come to think of it, I vaguely remembered being told to lie down and take it easy for at least 24 hours.
...Did that mean bed rest?

<Rika>
"...The wounded shouldn't be sneaking out of the hospital."

<Akasaka>
"People shouldn't be cutting phone cords."

<Rika>
"...Meep.
 I have no idea what you're talking about."

<Akasaka>
"Then I don't know what you're talking about either."
As we played dumb with each other, we both laughed at the same time.
If somebody saw us laughing at each other like this, it would probably bring a smile to their lips.

<Rika>
"...The chances of Akasaka leaving this village alive weren't very high."

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Rika>
"...I don't want Akasaka to die, so I'm glad you're leaving the village alive."

<Akasaka>
"Rika-chan.
 ...You knew who I was... right from the beginning, didn't you?"
She said nothing, but gave a firm nod.

<Akasaka>
"...Well then, I think you know this, but we're probably somewhat of an enemy to the people in this village, I would think.
 But you still gave me lots of warnings."
That's right.
 She said it at that time.
She wouldn't warn somebody that she was okay with dying.
 ...She definitely said something like that.

<Akasaka>
"Then... I should probably be thanking you."

<Rika>
"...You probably should.
 I'm your savior."
Saying that, she puffed up her chest proudly.
She said it jokingly, but the meaning behind those words was quite heavy.
That was because whether I lived or died was a decision that might have been made in a place unbeknownst to me.
She said those words with such an adorable smile that it took a few moments of silence for their weight to settle in.
...I'd been to this place before.
The Guardians's office was there: it was the stone steps leading up to the Furude Shrine.
When I passed by before, I was so focused on finding a phone booth I hadn't realized where I was.

<Akasaka>
"If I recall correctly... this shrine is Rika-chan's house, right?"

<Rika>
"...Yeah, something like that."
Looking up at the shrine grounds, it was brightly lit and energetic voices could be heard.
What was going on?

<Rika>
"...There's a festival today."

<Akasaka>
"A festival?"

<Rika>
"...The best and only festival in Hinamizawa.
 ...the Watanagashi festival."

<Akasaka>
"Watanagashi? Cotton... drifting?"

<Rika>
"...Just knowing the name is boring.
 ...Do you want to take a look?"
She asked bluntly.
...But, seeing that I looked interested, she climbed up a couple of steps and motioned for me to come.
...I was only going to go back and sleep anyways.
If I had nothing else to do, it might not be a bad idea to go with her on a little detour.
...In the hostile territory that was this village, I didn't know what would happen if I ventured down a side road without Ooishi.
...Even though I thought of the village like that, when I was with this girl, I forgot all about it.
...In any case, even without anything to back it up, I felt that as long as I was with her, none of the ill will from the village would befall me.
That's why, even though I knew my cover was blown, I strangely had no qualms about setting foot into the heart of the Onigafuchi Guardians's territory...
Climbing up to the grounds of the shrine,
 I could see there were about 3 pavilions set up, with meeting tables and folding chairs. 
The old folks from the village (no, the executives of the Guardians?) were already quite drunkenly sharing another round of drinks.
I could only see it as people from the village council drinking while enjoying the evening air.
At the very least, it was certainly quite different than any festival I'd ever seen.

<Rika>
"...See?
 It's quite a boring festival, isn't it?"

<Akasaka>
"Haha... this certainly doesn't look like a festival."

<Rika>
"...It's a festival that's happened since long ago, but as you can see, it's not like it used to be."
As if to chide the old folk, she said that while looking at them with an exasperated expression.
You really couldn't call this a festival any more.
It was just a bunch of neighbors getting together to drink under the guise of a festival.

<Akasaka>
"Haha... I feel sorry for the deity being celebrated here..."

<Rika>
"...Give this sorry excuse for a festival 5 or 6 more years, then everybody in the village will start coming...
 the ceremony will also be done properly, and it'll be a respectable festival again."
What she said was not so much wishful thinking as it was the telling of a future that had already been determined.
She wasn't even predicting it; it was almost like she was simply reporting the results.
 That's how it sounded.
Even though it was baseless speculation, the way she said it wouldn't let me interject.
It was the same way she talked when she 'changed.'
While I struggled to find the words to reply to her, she wandered over to the other side of the grounds, not minding me at all.
Not in a state where I could afford to be left behind, I hurriedly followed after her.
Passing through a copse of pine trees, a strong and cool breeze ruffled my hair.
...There, from that one evening, was the splendid observation platform the girl had shown me.
As it had grown completely dark, the modest lights littered across the nightscape were providing a different type of scenery.

<Rika>
"...Looking at it like this, this village seems tranquil."
She said that with an indifferent look on her face.

<Akasaka>
"Just the other day,
 ...you said that this village definitely wouldn't be submerged by the dam... didn't you?"
She didn't reply, seemingly relishing in the feeling of the wind blowing through her hair.

<Akasaka>
"Didn't that mean... at that point in time, the Minister had already complied with the demands?"

<Rika>
"..."
She spun around, her gaze meeting mine.
But she said nothing.
She spoke nothing that would neither confirm nor deny what I had just said.

<Akasaka>
"This case... will probably remain shrouded in darkness.
 ...Headquarters probably doesn't want trouble from a scandal with the Minister breaking out."

<Rika>
"...There's no mistake that they threatened to kill the grandchild."

<Akasaka>
"Then, negotiations with the Minister were successful... and the grandson was released."

<Rika>
"...The one who saved the grandson was you."

<Akasaka>
"I wonder about that.
 ...The discovery of that wallet that started this chain of events...
 that alone was almost too convenient, I'd think."
...Ever since the moment that wallet was discovered, I felt something was odd.
Ooishi said it as well.
That the Sonozaki family had given the order to release the hostage.
Meaning... that our little manhunt was a farce to begin with.
...Come to think of it, I was punched, kicked, and had a gun pointed at me.
I felt like they put up quite a fight, but that might have been all part of a good performance.
Once the negotiations were successful, they couldn't just say "here you go" and return the Minister's grandson right to his doorstep.
They knew that Public Safety had realized that this was a kidnapping case and were moving in on it.
That's why, due to the actions of Public Safety, the grandson was able to be rescued safely.
So the Minister didn't give in to any unreasonable demands.
 ...That type of performance was necessary.

<Rika>
"...I don't know about these difficult things."

<Akasaka>
"...Likewise.
 Even for me, I can't make much sense of it.
 But, there's one thing I can be certain of."

<Rika>
"...?"

<Akasaka>
"It's just as you said.
 ...This village won't be submerged.
 The dam project will soon be over."
That wasn't something an officer of the law should be saying.
But, I naturally let those words slip from my mouth.
This village may have stirred up all sorts of trouble.
But, that was because they were protecting their homes.
If someone just decided by themselves that I had to leave the house I was used to living in, I would resent them as well.
On top of that, it wasn't a place like mine where I just happened to be renting it, but a place that their families had lived for generations.
It might be ignorant to call their desperate resistance an overreaction.
I might not really be qualified to criticize politics or bureaucracy...
But, deliberately building a dam on land that was loved by its residents wasn't something I could get behind.

<Akasaka>
"Still, aren't you glad?"

<Rika>
"Why would that be?"

<Akasaka>
"At the very least.. with this, peace will return to this village."
Even though the Minister promised to use his considerable influence to cancel the project, it would probably take more than a few months before it would be completely scrapped.
At the very least... it would probably take one or two years.
For the villagers to officially hear that their village wasn't going to be submerged at the bottom of a dam was still a ways away.
But... it was no mistake that the promise of peace returning to the village was there.
It turned out, from beginning to end, that it had already all been decided.
Just as the girl had said, it was decided.
There wasn't really a need for me to come here in the first place.
There was absolutely no need for me to have come here and aggravate an unpleasant situation.
If I had never come here, then...
The grandson's release might have been done in a more amicable manner.

<Rika>
"...Peace?
 In this village?"
When I nodded, she laughed as if to admonish me.
But her face remained indifferent, expressionless.
And then, her eyes narrowed slightly as she snickered.

<Rika>
"...Even though every year from now on, something bloody will occur?
 ...Tee hee hee hee."

<Akasaka>
"Rika-chan,
 what are you talking about?"
As the wind blew her hair about, the girl, as if taking pleasure in that I was the only one who didn't know...
 continued to snicker as she looked at my face for a while.

<Rika>
"You see...
 in a few years...
 I'll be killed."
Huh...?
Backlit by the moon, It was hard to tell if her expression that had been cast in shadow was smiling, amused...
 or resigned.

<Akasaka>
"...You will?
 ...Why?"

<Rika>
"...It's a very unpleasant thing, though.
 ...It's also probably been decided already."

<Akasaka>
"Decided already? Who would decide that sort of thing!?"

<Rika>
"I'd like to know that as well."
Turning back to face me, she showed me a resolute expression for the first time...
And after staring into my eyes for a moment, she turned back to gaze at the scenery before she spoke her next words.

<Rika>
"...There's a lot of people who have no regard for human life.
 ...Even if I tell you this, it might not change anything, though. 

<Rika>
But... if you want to erase the specter of death, sometimes, like with the reflection of the moon on the water, all you have to do is throw a small stone."
I had no idea what she was trying to say.
It's just... I had to listen to every word with my body and soul, or at least, that's what I thought.

<Rika>
"...This day next year.
 ...Yes, June 1979, on this day.
 The foreman of the dam construction project will be killed."

<Akasaka>
"...What...?"
For a moment, I couldn't comprehend what she was talking about.
By the foreman... did she mean that gruff old man I played mahjong with?

<Akasaka>
"...B-
Be killed...
 ...What makes you think..."
She didn't answer.
But she had the same expression on her face as she did when she declared that the dam project would go away.
...That wasn't the face of somebody making a forecast or a prediction.
...It was something that was already decided,
 no--
 it was as if she was already reporting the results... that sort of expression.

<Rika>
"...After being killed in a gruesome manner, the body will be torn apart and disposed of."

<Akasaka>
"...Murdered and dismembered..."

<Rika>
"...The next year, in June of 1980 on this day.
 ...Satoko's parents will be pushed to their deaths."
...Satoko?
It was the first time I heard that name, but I didn't have the courage to interrupt the girl's story.

<Rika>
"...It might be an accident.
 ...An unfortunate accident."
The girl smiled faintly... but she wasn't exactly encouraging me to smile along with the lifeless look in her eyes.

<Rika>
"And then, the year after that, this day in June of 1981.
 ...My parents will be killed.

<Rika>
And then the year after that, this day in June of 1982.
 Satoko's abusive aunt will have her head split open and die.

<Rika>
And then the year after that, this day in the June of 1983...
 ...Or possibly a few days afterwards.

<Rika>
...I will be killed.

<Rika>
If all the deaths are pre-ordained...
 ...Then the last one would also be all according to plan.
 ...But then whose plan would it be...?"
This village is full of murderers and people who have no regard for human life.
It would be fine to believe that all the deaths up to 1982 would be the work of somebody in the village.
It would be fine to believe that all the deaths that would occur were at the discretion of those who control the village.
But that didn't explain what would happen in 1983.
There was no way that the last death would fit in with anybody's plans.
They had no regard for human life.
They would use every means at their disposal to meet their goals.
But their goals were at odds with the last death.
That's why the last death was unrelated to them.
But that last death would definitely,
 most likely,
 probably,
 without question,
 happen.
Probably, definitely, I dare say.
The last death would be a merciful one.
A handkerchief or something being placed over their mouth, making them lose consciousness, never to wake up again.
Exactly whose plan was that?

<Rika>
"...I want to live happily.
 ...That's my only wish.

<Rika>
Surrounded by my precious friends, spending our days enjoyably.
 ...Only that.
 I don't wish for anything more than that."

<Akasaka>
"...Rika-chan..."

<Rika>
"...I don't want to die."
The girl, stoic as ever, let those last words slip in the end.
...Eventually, we were discovered by some drunks.
The girl, as well as I, were dragged back to the festivities.
Everybody was completely drunk, so even when they saw my head completely wrapped in bandages, they wouldn't let me leave.
...Well certainly, if I was in good enough condition to slip out of the hospital, it must not be that serious.
The girl was mingling with everybody, being pampered like a kitten.
Her expression was adorable... nothing like the one from just before,
 predicting her own death and whispering that she didn't want to die.
Having said that...
...Having a silly and lively conversation like this, it was hard to believe that these people were the core of an extremist resistance group.
Even if it was a shell of its former self, it was a festival where people in the village gathered, so the twenty-some-odd folk here should have included some of the village executives and other important members.
...Among those, there was no doubt that there were members that were at the Sonozaki family council in attendance.
Meaning, even if we never met face-to-face before, there were people here who knew my identity.
In a small village like this, they knew the faces of all the villagers that lived here.
That's why, without even saying anything, it soon became obvious that I was an outsider.
But they actually seemed interested by that, asking me all sorts of questions about Tokyo, 
drinking while musing on the faint relationship the city had with the villagers and empathizing with the rather meager environment.
The confidential talks with the Minister were finished, his grandson was in police custody... everything was over.
I might not have to be put in another perilous situation.
To me, they were only my adversaries because of my job.
 Outside of that, there was no reason I couldn't be friendly with them.
...The next time I visited this village...
would it return to being a tranquil and beautiful place?
If that happened, I might be able to take a relaxed walk around the village with her again.
My cup was once again filled to the brim with beer...
By the time I was able to get away, it was the middle of the night.
The girl had at some point disappeared.
It seems that her parents had told her to go home and sleep when she let out a large yawn.
The old folks, who had absolutely no remorse for making an injured person hang out with them, told me as much as they laughed.
I was just there drinking, so I had thought to help a bit with clean up. However, my help was refused on the grounds that I was a guest.
On top of that, they had a car prepared to take me back to the hospital.
Losing the battle against my sleepiness inside the car, I was sound asleep until we reached the parking lot of the hospital.
The front door of the hospital was naturally locked at this hour.
I wandered around bewilderedly searching for a back entrance until somebody on night duty found out and let me inside.

<Man>
"Where were you this late at night?
 Dr. Irie was worried, you know..."

<Akasaka>
"...Sorry for the trouble.
 I was held up by the people having a festival at the shrine..."

<Man>
"Oh, they did say something about everybody in the town council getting together for a drink.
 My condolences.
 ...Are your wounds all right?"

<Akasaka>
"...They're throbbing a bit.
 It's probably because of the alcohol, I think."

<Man>
"Oh, that's right.
 The detective that was with you wanted to get in touch."

<Akasaka>
"...Oops.
 I kept Ooishi-san waiting..."
I glanced at the clock.
No matter how you looked at it, it was way too late to call him now.
 I'll apologize to him tomorrow over the phone...
I returned back to my hospital room and slipped into the bed that was still unmade from the time I went outside.
...Oh, that's no good.
 I have to turn off the lights.
......But my weariness had cut the cord powering my body, lulling me into a deep sleep.



[Himatsubushi Ch.10]

"Sir, sir...
 We're preparing to land.
 Excuse me, but will you please fasten your seatbelt?"
It seemed I had fallen fast asleep inside the plane.
I was finally awoken from my slumber by the stewardess.
I only had carry-on luggage on top of it being a domestic flight, so the time between disembarking and entering the lobby was almost non-existent.
.........
......

<Miyuki>
"...Papa? Are you there, Papa?"

<Akasaka>
"...Huh? Oh..."

<Miyuki>
"Are you all right?
 Were you having a scary dream?"
Miyuki was sitting next to me, I quickly patted her head after hearing her say that.
I must have had a bad dream while sleeping in the cabin. ...I was sweating profusely.

<Akasaka>
"...No, it's nothing.
 I guess it's a little hot in here... ahaha."
I tried to wipe away the sweat while answering, and looked around for a handkerchief or towel.
...And then, a cold drop ran down my forehead.
Miyuki turned to me and smiled, then wiped my face with the towel she received at takeoff.

<Akasaka>
"...Thanks, Miyuki."

<Miyuki>
"Of course.
 Ehehe~"
Thanks to her, I was finally able to shake off my slumber, so I got up from the aisle seat and looked out the window.
I wrapped my arms around Miyuki in the window seat and listened to the noise as the land and sea blew past us before our eyes.

<Miyuki>
"Wow~, it's Hokkaido.
 Hokkaido is so big~♪"
And then the plane gently turned before entering the airport runway...
Arriving at the lobby, I glanced around, looking for Ooishi...
 and was met with a familiar gruff voice calling out to me.

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-saaaan!!
 Na ha ha ha!
 How many years has it been~?
 It's been a while, hasn't it!!!"

<Akasaka>
"Ooishi-san!
 It really has been a long time."
Ooishi clapped his hand down on my shoulder, celebrating our reunion.

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san, you're looking pretty good.
 You look like a bonafide front-line investigator now."

<Akasaka>
"You're looking quite dapper yourself.
 Your posture seems a lot better.
 ...Is the ballroom dancing paying off?"

<Ooishi>
"Mfu fu fu!
 You should give it a try while you're still young.
 You'd be a hit with the ladies.
 A real babe magnet!
 Nfu fu fu!!"
Ooishi had retired and moved to Sapporo, and of all things, had started taking ballroom dancing lessons.
He had apparently gotten really into it, and had decided to spend the rest of his new life devoted to that hobby.
He was aiming to get his instructor's qualifications before he hit 80, and live out his old age dandily.

<Ooishi>
"...Oh?
 Nfu fu fu, who might this be...?"
Ooishi suddenly turned his attention to Miyuki, who was standing idly next to me. He bent down on his knee to look her in the face.
However, my daughter was frightened and hid behind my back.

<Akasaka>
"Come on, Miyuki.
 Please introduce yourself properly."

<Miyuki>
"...Oh, uh... Umm..."
She was staring at Ooishi with a dubious expression while tugging at the hem of my shirt.
...She's usually not this shy. I wonder what's wrong.

<Akasaka>
"...Sorry about that.
 She's usually not like this..."

<Ooishi>
"Oh no, it's no problem.
 This old man just has a scary face... If you don't mind, could you tell me your name?"

<Miyuki>
"...Umm, I'm Miyuki Akasaka.
 I'm 7 years old.
 N... nice to meet you."

<Ooishi>
"Great, that was a good introduction.
 I'd expect no less from Akasaka-san's daughter... Na ha ha ha."
Ooishi gently stroked Miyuki's head and smiled as though she were his own grandchild.
After finally seeing that, Miyuki smiled in relief.
...Shortly afterwards, Miyuki told me that she was just doing what I had told her to do, "Be careful around strangers."
Ooishi overheard that and let out a hearty "Wa ha ha ha!!" shaking his body while laughing and walking...
I let myself into Ooishi's car, and we headed out towards the hot spring inn.
I had originally intended to crash at Ooishi's place,
 but Ooishi was quite obstinate that his home wasn't suitable for that, so it came to this.
At the inn, we relaxed while soaking in the hot springs, reminiscing about the time we played mahjong together in Hinamizawa.
At the inn, we relaxed while soaking in the hot springs, then ate a delicious feast until we were full. Miyuki had a little of the mongolian barbecue and was delighted with it.
After our bellies were swollen, Miyuki grew sleepy and went off to bed. Then Ooishi and I reminisced about the time we played mahjong together in Hinamizawa.
It seemed that to celebrate our reunion, Ooishi had looked for people who could play,
 but unable to find a suitable candidate, we had to give up on putting together a table.
As we drank together, we excitedly recounted our exploits during the final manhunt...

<Akasaka>
"...Did they end up catching those two guys?"

<Ooishi>
"Nooope.
 In the end, the search team never found them.
 They were probably hidden by the villagers, then sent overseas or somewhere else far away to lay low for a bit."

<Akasaka>
"Ooishi-san, if I remember correctly, you managed to grab one of their guns, didn't you?
 Did you learn anything from that?"

<Ooishi>
"It was a foreign military pistol.
dialog000 It's probably from the ones the gangs in Kansai managed to smuggle in a ton of.
 We tried to get a match from the rifling, but it didn't show up in any other cases. 

<Ooishi>
...How about on your end?"

<Akasaka>
"After that, I was removed from the front lines, so I don't know much.
 In the end, it seems like everything was settled under the veil of secrecy."

<Ooishi>
"...Na ha ha ha ha ha..."
Ooishi smiled wryly as he sipped his chilled drink.

<Ooishi>
"...What happened after that... sure was tough, huh?
 ...It has been 7 years now?"

<Akasaka>
"Yeah.
 We held the memorial service a few days ago.
 I've become estranged with my father-in-law lately, so it was rough getting everything ready."

<Ooishi>
"...Na ha ha ha.
 That must have been a lot of work..."
It was then that the hostess brought in the extra drinks that we had ordered before.
While the bottles of beer clanked as she brought them in, we halted our conversation.
...What Ooishi meant when he said it must have been tough...
Thinking about that was still hard.. but time had healed the wound.
It was the day after.
When I phoned Ooishi to apologize.
When I did, Ooishi almost immediately handed the phone to one of my colleagues, who happened to be there.
Not only was I injured in the brawl with the suspects, but I'd disappeared to drink late into the night without leaving any sort of contact information, so I thought he'd definitely be mad.
However, all he said was that it was something he couldn't talk about over the phone, and that I should come to the station as soon as possible.
At the time, I could only think that he must have been really pissed off.
But when I arrived at the station, he said this:

<Person in Charge>
"It seems your wife was involved in an accident."
Having no idea what happened, I borrowed the phone to contact the hospital Yukie was staying at.
...After being given the runaround several times,
 I was finally able to talk to someone in charge... and after mincing words for quite some time,
 they told me.

<Man>
"Yukie Akasaka...
 died in an accident."
The world became a blur as I sat there dumbfounded...
Yukie's death was unbelievably abrupt...
 unbelievably sudden.
I could have understood if there was some kind of problem during the birth...
But Yukie's death wasn't anything like that.
On the stairs on the way up to the roof...
 she just happened to slip...
 and fall.
And she just happened to fall on an unfortunate place at an unfortunate angle.
 ...That was it.
Wanting to blame Yukie's death on somebody, I began to think that it was an act of revenge by the Guardians, that they killed my wife and made it look like an accident.
What I learned when I flew back to Tokyo, however, was much more cruel than that.
Yukie had a habit of going up to the roof to cool off in the evening.
There was an elevator up to the 7th floor, but from there you had to take the stairs to get to the roof.
...Even late in her pregnancy, when the evening came, she would always head up there.
Her father had always said for her not to push herself,
 but Yukie insisted that until the time she had no choice but to stay in bed, she should be allowed to do as she wished.
However, I had never once seen Yukie go up to the roof.
I only heard that from her father and the nurses.
 ...That was because whenever I visited her, she would spend that time with me instead.
I heard the reason why Yukie went up to the roof from a nurse she had become friendly with.
She had said that her husband was away on business a lot of the time.
And that whenever he called, she was able to cheer him up and give him courage...
 but when he didn't call, she couldn't do that.
Her husband might put on a show of bravado, but in reality, he grew lonesome pathetically fast.
...She was probably just the same.
 Whenever he left for business, not clear when he'd be back... she felt very lonely.
Whenever she cheered him up, she was actually cheering herself up as well.
That's why... whenever he went far away for an important job...
On the evenings he didn't call...
 At the very least, she felt that standing underneath the same sky, her feelings would reach him.
At that moment...
 I remembered the words that girl had told me.
That it was best that I go back to Tokyo right away...
 otherwise there would be something I'd regret horribly.
...Yes, that's it.
Because I was away on business that day, Yukie had headed up to the roof.
Had I known that this would have been the result... Had I done as the girl had said and dropped everything to head back to Tokyo...
I might have been with Yukie on the day she died.
 If I was with her, she wouldn't have gone up to the roof.
The day my wife died... was on the evening of the third day of my trip.
Yes.
 It was right before the time I had the sudden urge to hear Yukie's voice, and ran around the village trying to find a phone.
The girl had gone around and cut all the phone cords.
...If she hadn't, and I had made that call.
I would have undoubtedly learned of Yukie's death at that time, and collapsed in tears.
Of course, even though the cords were cut, it had only put me off learning of Yukie's death by that one evening.
In the end, I had learned of it the next morning...
However, when I managed to put my emotions in order, I realized it was that girl's small token of consideration.

<Ooishi>
"....That's the first I've heard about that."

<Akasaka>
"...Yeah.
 ...It's the first time I've talked about it."

<Ooishi>
"Nahahaha...
 ...could it have been a coincidence?
 She doesn't have any special powers or anything."

<Akasaka>
"...Aren't you the one who told me, Ooishi-san?
 That she might be the reincarnation of the god called Oyashiro-sama."

<Ooishi>
"Well, yeah.
 ...The old folks in the village believed that Rika Furude had divine powers."

<Akasaka>
"...Divine powers?"
Ooishi had originally said it as a kind of joke, but realizing that I was serious, he slumped his shoulders.

<Ooishi>
"I don't know if it's the truth or not.

<Ooishi>
They said she did things like prophesize the future, or talk about things she should have no way of knowing.
 That she was clairvoyant, that it was divine revelation.

<Ooishi>
Well, all sorts of things.
 Of course they couldn't give specific examples, though.
 Nahahaha..."

<Akasaka>
"...She prophesized Yukie's accident."
Ooishi tried to laugh it off, but out of respect to my deceased wife, he kept it restrained.

<Ooishi>
"Does that mean an active and capable investigator from the Metropolitan Police Department believes in divine powers and curses?"
...Having him say that so bluntly, I couldn't respond.
Of course I had no intention of believing such odd things.
But... he could only say that because he didn't know what I did.
Since I met that other girl, who both was and wasn't Rika Furude...
 ...I couldn't deny the existence of any otherworldly entity.

<Akasaka>
"Of course I can't deny that it might not have been prescience, but rather a warning."
Not prescience, but a warning.
...If what that girl has said was a warning about Yukie's accident, then things became much easier to understand.
Basically the line of thinking became that it was a threat... because I didn't go back to Tokyo, my wife was killed in a way that made it look like an accident.

<Ooishi>
"...Not satisfied with the investigation into your wife's accident?"

<Akasaka>
"Of course, I suspected foul play.
 I pored over the results, and even carried out my own personal investigation."
There weren't any witnesses to Yukie's fall.
There was the possibility that somebody had hidden, waiting to push Yukie down the stairs.
However, the cleaning ladies frequented the roof to hang laundry, and the security cameras on each floor hadn't recorded anything out the ordinary.
There wasn't anything set up on the stairs, and I was unable to find anything suspicious.

<Akasaka>
"...In the end, even after my personal investigation, I can't think that anything else happened other than a simple accident."

<Ooishi>
"..."

<Akasaka>
"Well, of course...
 These were the guys that took the Minister's grandson hostage.
 It wouldn't be impossible for them to push a lone pregnant woman down the stairs without leaving any evidence."
Ooishi's expression had completely sobered up.

<Ooishi>
"They...
 murdered...
 your wife?"
...When Yukie died, I thought that as well.
More precisely, I wanted to blame somebody, so I created the most viable scapegoat.
But without any clear evidence, that violent notion faded along with the wounds in my heart.

<Akasaka>
"Did that girl know beforehand about my wife's death and was threatening me,
 or did she prophesize that death and was offering me a road to salvation? 

<Akasaka>
...If I had to choose between the two, I would tend towards the latter."

<Ooishi>
"....Na ha ha ha."
Ooishi smiled slightly in disbelief as he poured more beer from his bottle.

<Ooishi>
"...Then if I may?
 If what you say is true, then Rika Furude was a prophet who knew the future.

 If so, why didn't she predict that disaster? 

<Ooishi>
If she knew that the gas eruption was going to happen, why did she remain silent?
 Even a few hours beforehand would have been enough. 

<Ooishi>
If the village knew, then most of the people would have escaped without dying."
It was near the end of June 1983.
Volcanic gases from the Onigafuchi Swamp erupted and hit the village in the middle of the night.
It was an unprecedented disaster where the whole populace was wiped out.
It caused a wave of panic about volcanic gas across the country, causing people to overreact over any reports of odd smells.
I hadn't heard of the blockade on the Hinamizawa area being lifted, so it should still be cordoned off.

<Akasaka>
"...That's...
 hm."
It was my turn to be lost for a response.

<Ooishi>
"Well...
 If Rika Furude, the reincarnation of Oyashiro-sama, was killed, then the village might have incurred the god's wrath, making him call forth the miasma from the swamp to kill everyone. 

<Ooishi>
That explanation is what the survivors are whispering about..."

<Akasaka>
"Sorry, Ooishi-san.
 ...Did you just say she was killed?"

<Ooishi>
"Huh?
 ....Ah, yeah.
 ...Well, I don't think it would be a problem if I told you..."
When I saw the news about the gas disaster, I remembered that girl.
I then found her name in the list of victims.
That's why, at the time, I thought her own death she had predicted was due to the gas.
It was after that I learned from the tabloids of the series of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa during the five years leading up to the disaster that became known as the "curse of Oyashiro-sama."
And that string of mysterious deaths lined up exactly with what that girl had predicted, so I had always thought to ask Ooishi about it, as he had been involved in the investigation.
That's right.
That was the reason for our reunion...
But right now, Ooishi had said:
Rika Furude didn't die in the disaster...
 but was killed!?

<Akasaka>
"...Can I ask you about the last year of the curse?"

<Ooishi>
"Hmmm... I may be retired, but I still have to keep things confidential, ya know?
 Nfu fu fu!"

<Akasaka>
"Excuse me, madam?
 Do you have anything cold that's brewed locally? High-grade, if there is.
 I'll leave the selection to you."

<Ooishi>
"Na ha ha ha!!
 Oh my... I didn't mean it that way!"
Ooishi laughed loudly, not wholly unsatisfied, and stopped the hostess to tell her that the cheap booze was fine.

<Akasaka>
"I know as much as was written in those magazines.
 But I don't know anything about the curse that happened the year of the disaster."

<Ooishi>
"Because the entire area around Hinamizawa was sealed off, you see?

<Ooishi>
There wasn't much of an investigation that could be done on the last year of the curse. 

<Ooishi>
Even if after several years the quarantine is lifted, the villagers are mostly dead, and what few survivors there were mostly went to stay with relatives, their whereabouts mostly unknown. 

<Ooishi>
...It's a complete dead end."
Ooishi seemed to postulate to himself as he stared at the ceiling, as if trying to work out a memory from the rusty cogs in his head.
And then, he said in a completely sober voice:

<Ooishi>
"...The magazines made it seem like the curse of the fifth year was that disaster. 

<Ooishi>
...But the actual curse really happened on the day of the Watanagashi festival.
 A photographer by the name of Jirou Tomitake.
 He was the victim."
Ooishi gestured about how the victim tore out his own throat with his fingernails as he talked.

<Ooishi>
"And the burnt corpse of the woman Tomitake was in a relationship with was found in the mountains.
 The neighboring Prefectural Police weren't very cooperative, so I don't know much about it, though."

<Akasaka>
dialog001"...There were two victims in one night?"

<Ooishi>
"...Hmmm, actually, see.
 It wasn't just those two.
 ...You see, the next day...
 ...Kumagai-kun, one of my subordinates, disappeared along with his car in the middle of his investigation."
Kumagai was a younger detective that was going to be partnered with Ooishi after we first met.

<Ooishi>
"He was going around the village to question people about the incident with Tomitake.
 ...He might have gotten caught up in something.

 ...If he was with me, he might have been safe... even now it still stings. 

<Ooishi>
That day, for some reason, I did a real number on my stomach.
 ...I had to pass on going around outside."

<Akasaka>
"...He got too close to the truth... and was made to disappear?"

<Ooishi>
"...That's what I think.
 Kuma-chan was young and had a promising future ahead of him, but he still didn't have enough experience on the scene...
 He wasn't used to dealing with any complications."
Ooishi lamented the fact that he wasn't with his subordinate that day.

<Ooishi>
"And then, the next day, see.
 ...Ah, you know him as well, Akasaka-san.
 You know, Dr. Irie.
 You remember him?"

<Akasaka>
"...Ahh, that young doctor from the hospital?
 I vaguely remember."

<Ooishi>
"For whatever reason, he committed suicide with sleeping pills.
 ...No suicide note or anything.
 The autopsy confirmed that it was the sleeping pills.
 Nothing was in doubt except for the motive."

<Akasaka>
"....It isn't that hard to make it look like somebody died from taking sleeping pills, is it?
 Any possibility it was a murder?"

<Ooishi>
"He was single, no prior marriages.
 It didn't seem like he was going out with anybody in particular. 

<Ooishi>
He was the coach of the local junior baseball team, and was on good terms with the villagers. He was liked by everybody.
 ...I couldn't find anybody who would want to do him harm. 

<Ooishi>
...Well, any chances to investigate were ruined by the disaster, though.
 There's no way to find out anything about him now."

<Akasaka>
"...
Then, what about Rika Furude's death?"

<Ooishi>
"It was that day.
 Around noon, some of the old folks who were visiting the shrine
 discovered the corpse of Rika Furude."

<Akasaka>
"...Murder?"

<Ooishi>
"...Before we continue, you should probably stop eating that squid soumen."

<Akasaka>
"...That bad?"
Ooishi nodded firmly...

<Ooishi>
"The corpse was found on the shrine grounds, next to the donation box.
 ...Although she was probably killed somewhere else.

<Ooishi>
That's because while she was completely naked,
 there wasn't any dirt on the soles of her feet."

<Akasaka>
"...Any sign it was a crime of gratification?"

<Ooishi>
"According to the autopsy, there wasn't any indication of that. 

<Ooishi>
...What we know is that she was rendered unconscious by some sort of drug, carried to that place, then had her abdomen sliced wide open.
 Her organs were deliberately removed and scattered about."

<Akasaka>
dialog002"...Unconscious?
 ...Then, she wasn't cut open after her death?"

<Ooishi>
"..."

<Akasaka>
"...That's...
 horrible."
That girl's prediction... was right on the mark.
...I'm pretty sure she was more detailed about the other deaths that lead up to her own.
...For example, I think she said that the housewife that was beaten to death on the fourth year had her head split open.
...Then in that case... did she know that her own death would be so terrible...?
There must have been some moments where she wanted to doubt the validity of her own predictions.
But... as people died exactly as prophesized... as the years passed, that prophecy would only come closer to fruition.
And then, facing the final year... unable to struggle against her own destiny... her all-too-young life was snuffed out.
 ...And in...
 ...such a cruel way.
Knowing that her days were numbered... and unable to fight the tide of events heralding her end... my heart ached at her helplessness.

<Ooishi>
"...About the way she died... it seems like it wasn't just somebody's sick tastes.
 ...What I'm saying is... I've told you before about how Hinamizawa used to be home to demons, didn't I?"

<Akasaka>
"Yeah... I think I remember..."

<Ooishi>
"The festival in Hinamizawa village--Watanagashi... the 'Cotton Drifting,' seems to stem from the drifting of entrails. 

<Ooishi>
...It seems that it came from the man-eating demons ripping apart their victims and throwing their organs into the river."

<Akasaka>
"...In other words... in Hinamizawa, pulling out entrails had some sort of religious meaning?"

<Ooishi>
".... Well... this is according to the old tales in Hinamizawa, you see. 

<Ooishi>
...To act as an arbitrator so that the humans and the man-eating demons could live together peacefully, a god known as 'Oyashiro-sama' descended from the heavens."

<Akasaka>
"...If I recall... Rika Furude was said to be the living incarnation of that Oyashiro-sama, wasn't she?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah.
 So... cutting open Rika Furude, who was a living god, would be to the village nothing less than absolute sacrilege."

<Akasaka>
"...Absolute sacrilege.
 ...In other words, you mean sacrilege towards Oyashiro-sama?"

<Ooishi>
"...The rest you should know, Akasaka-san.
 'The Wrath of Oyashiro-sama' would occur that same night."

<Akasaka>
"The Great Hinamizawa Disaster."
The official explanation was that some swamp upstream erupted with toxic volcanic gas which enveloped the village.

<Ooishi>
"The swamp where it erupted was called Onigafuchi Swamp.
 It was the origin of Hinamizawa's old name, Onigafuchi Village. 

<Ooishi>
According to village lore, the depths of the swamp apparently lead to Hell, where the man-eating demons came from."

<Akasaka>
"...That almost seems too perfect."

<Ooishi>
"Oh no no no. That's just the tip of the iceberg.
 There was another bit of folklore in the village--if Oyashiro-sama became angry, the cauldron of Hell would open up and miasma would flow out... or so they say."

<Akasaka>
"...To the villagers, Hell was at the bottom of the swamp.
 So basically, the miasma poured out, smothering the village...?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah.
 Basically: due to the sacrilegious way that Rika Furude--the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama--was killed, the village incurred the wrath of Oyashiro-sama, in the form of that disaster. 

<Ooishi>
...That seems to be their explanation."

<Akasaka>
"...So what you're saying is that the disaster wasn't a natural one!?"

<Ooishi>
"Hmmm... Well everything does seem to fit together a little too well.
 If Oyashiro-sama's curse doesn't really exist, and everything really was just a matter of coincidence... I would doubt it."
A wry smile formed on Ooishi's face as he listened to my absurd take on things.
...He wore an expression as though even if it were absurd, there was a time he had thought the same thing as well.

<Akasaka>
"...In regards to the religious beliefs of the villagers... suppose there was a more fanatical group among them... 

<Akasaka>
...and that group created a situation that would incur 'Oyashiro-sama's wrath,' and enacted the Disaster to make it seem like the truth..."

<Ooishi>
"...Of course, I won't laugh.
 I've wandered down that line of reasoning more than once myself.

<Ooishi>
However... even though Hinamizawa is a small village, it still has a population of over 1000 people.
 To murder that many people in a single night doesn't seem realistic, no matter how you think about it."
The gas eruption was believed to have happened around 2 AM.
Several hours before dawn.
 In that short amount of time, going around and killing all the villagers in a way that made it look like poison gas... didn't seem feasible at all.

<Akasaka>
"...The swamp the gas erupted from still had some religious significance, didn't it? 

<Akasaka>
...If that's the case... then maybe there was something set up in the swamp. Something that could be activated whenever a divine verdict was rendered..."

<Ooishi>
"According to the JSDF press release, the swamp was declared the source of the eruption.
 This was after everything was thoroughly looked over by their investigative team. 

<Ooishi>
If anything like that was set up, I think they would have found it..."

<Akasaka>
"It wouldn't necessarily have to be in the swamp itself.
 ...Come on, haven't you ever heard about it?
 The old story about how when a faraway spring dried up, the village spring dried up as well."

<Ooishi>
"What do you mean by that?"

<Akasaka>
"Many waterways are connected by underground aquifers.
 Swamps and springs are only the parts that manage to pop above the surface."

<Ooishi>
"...Na ha ha ha.
 So what you're saying, is that Onigafuchi Swamp is connected to another swamp or spring, 

<Ooishi>
and there's something the villagers rigged up there long ago, something that changes the pressure of Onigafuchi Swamp, causing it to erupt with poison gas?
 ...Is that what you're getting at?"
Ooishi laughed heartily, commending the fact that the young'uns have a nice flexible way of thinking. That was the former detective in him.
...Even though it was a hypothesis that he didn't come up with, he still had the presence of mind to not dismiss it right away.

<Ooishi>
"...That's an interesting theory.
 ...If that proves to be true, then it would be, unprecedentedly, the largest mass murder in the history of Japan."

<Akasaka>
"Once the quarantine on Hinamizawa Village is lifted, I think it should definitely be investigated.
 ...Ooishi-san, do you still have any connections with the XX Prefectural Police?"

<Ooishi>
"Somewhat.
 ...I'm an honorary advisor for their judo classes, so even now I pop by during summer training camps and such."

<Akasaka>
"...I don't know when the quarantine on Hinamizawa Village will be lifted... but please, let me help investigate."

<Ooishi>
"...Got it."

<Akasaka>
"...Ooishi-san, how do you feel about the string of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa they call the curse of Oyashiro-sama?"

<Ooishi>
"...At the time, the villagers were putting a lot of pressure on the station.
 The official stance on things was that the cases were unrelated.
 That each case was separate, each with its own resolution."

<Akasaka>
"...That couldn't be.
 Even though it was blatantly obvious that the cases were connected, based on the village's religious beliefs?"

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san, we can only say that now because of the rather grandiose way things ended after five years.
 ...At the time, those coincidental incidents just happened to coincidently occur on the day of Watanagashi. 

<Ooishi>
Just a 'it would be nice if nothing happened this year' kind of feel to it."

<Akasaka>
"Coincidence?
 ...The girl predicted everything from the beginning."

<Ooishi>
"...Girl?"

<Akasaka>
"Rika Furude.
 ...That child warned me about all the incidents that would happen afterwards."

<Ooishi>
"...Akasaka-san,
 is that true!?"

<Akasaka>
"Yes.
 ...The girl said as much.
 That the next year, the dam foreman would be killed, and his corpse dismembered.
 Not only that, she warned me of all the events that would transpire in the following years."

<Ooishi>
"...Akasaka-san, when she told you all of that, what year was it!?"

<Akasaka>
"When I met the girl, I was investigating the kidnapping incident... so June of 1978."

<Ooishi>
"...The year before the dismemberment murder."
Wrinkles formed between Ooishi's eyebrows as he closed his eyes and began to digest what I had just told him...

<Ooishi>
"...Akasaka-san.
 If you're wrong about Rika Furude knowing the future through some divine medium... This is getting ridiculous."

<Akasaka>
"...Yup."

<Ooishi>
"...If you're just trying to shock me, I'm going to be really angry, you know?"

<Akasaka>
"I'm... speaking the truth.

<Akasaka>
...Then the script behind the chain of mysterious deaths was written a year before it even started.

<Akasaka>
...And, just as predicted, Rika Furude was killed.
 ...At first, I thought she meant that she would be killed in the disaster. 

<Akasaka>
However... now I know that her death wasn't due to that, but rather an atrocious one at the hands of a murderer.
 ...She said she would be killed. 

<Akasaka>
...At that point in time, she knew more or less how her own death would occur."

<Ooishi>
"...Then, why didn't Rika Furude try and run away?"

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"Even if her death was already spelled out for her...
 Knowing that, she still had a grace period of several years, didn't she?

<Ooishi>
She had plenty of time to try and run away or consult the police.
 ...Why did she just accept her death with no resistance?"

<Akasaka>
"...I don't know."

<Ooishi>
"...Even though Rika Furude was doted upon by the older folks in the village, you see... 

<Ooishi>
After she lost her parents, she had no living relatives, and lived a fairly solitary life other than hanging around with some close friends. 

<Ooishi>
...It might have been she didn't have any power to fight or anybody to rely on."

<Akasaka>
"...She must have tried signaling somebody for help in regards to her own death, though?"

<Ooishi>
"You know very well that the village and the police weren't very amicable with one another, Akasaka-san.
 ...At the very least, I never heard anything about Rika Furude seeking protection from anybody."

<Akasaka>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"....Or... it could be that she simply resigned herself to being a religious sacrifice...
 It could have been something like that."

<Akasaka>
"There's no way that was the case."
I spoke decisively.
At that time, she said it.
She had definitely said that she wanted to live happily. That she wanted to spend her time surrounded by her dear friends.
She hadn't given up on life. She had hoped to keep on living.
Ah...
At that moment, I became dumbstruck.

<Ooishi>
"...What's the matter?
 Akasaka-san?"

<Akasaka>
"...No... It's nothing."
I fell into silence.
 ...Ooishi folded his arms and began murmuring in contemplation again.
Eventually, he stood up and headed towards the hallway to find the hostess, yelling that he wanted a pen and paper.
When Ooishi--noisy even though he was just thinking--left... the room immediately fell into a chilled silence.
I stood up. It was then I realized that I was drunk enough to be unsteady on my feet.
When I slid open the window... a beautiful yet somehow ephemeral moon drifted across the night sky.
It was just now... that I realized.
She hadn't accepted her own death.
She wanted to keep living.
 Happily and joyously.
 ...She had said that quite clearly to me.
But I was a fool.
I hadn't been asked explicitly... so I hadn't realized it.
She had made it clear as day that she didn't want to die.
 Wasn't that her cry for help?
She didn't say as much that she <i>wanted</i> help.
But, even given that, it wasn't as though she wasn't looking for salvation.
Without any family and unable to trust the police... she instead told somebody without any relation to the village, somebody from a faraway place... me.
Help me.
She had gone around and cut the phone cords.
If I had made that phone call and learned of Yukie's death, I probably would have fallen into despair.
...If I was in that state, even if she was looking for help, her cries would have fallen on deaf ears.
That's why.
 ...Knowing everything, she had cut the phone cords.
She wanted even a little time to seek help from me.
Ooishi, just before now... had lamented that one of the younger officers gotten mixed up in a case, having been erased because he wasn't there.
...I was feeling the same way.
If only...
 I was there in June of 1983.
I could have protected her.
In 1983, it would have been five years since the kidnapping took place.
While raising the only daughter Yukie had left me, putting all my youth and passion into my work, honing my wits and courage wrestling with difficult cases...
Nothing like my failings during the kidnapping incident would have occurred.
I wouldn't have been slow to react in a one-on-one fight, and by that point I'd jumped into foreign mafia-run gambling parlors where I'd learned to deal with automatic weapons, let alone handguns.
I had grown so much that in 1983 I couldn't have been even compared to how I was in 1978.
That's why...
If I was by her side, I should have been able to save her life.
No matter what conspiracy or foul plots drew near, I definitely would have protected her!
She, even though sounding resigned, should have still been able to ask me for help.
I just didn't realize it. I couldn't realize it.
Just as I wouldn't have realized it if I was told of Yukie's accident, I wasn't able to realize it.
I wanted to cry.
If I had taken her words to heart, I would have prevented Yukie's accident.
And I would have been able to protect the girl to whom I owed a debt from even a predetermined death.
She must have been expecting that from me!!
I learned about the disaster while watching television in my house.
 Until I learned about that, I had forgotten about Hinamizawa.
In order to recover from the shock of Yukie's death, I had tried to remove everything about the place from my memory.
What an ungrateful fool I was!
Even though in exchange for saving her, the girl had told me of a way to save Yukie?
I was unable to accept her gratitude, and now here we were...!
...She hadn't died in her sleep due to an natural disaster.
...She was split open while still alive, killed while suffering the disgrace of having her organs torn out.
She must have known beforehand, that on that day on that year, she would be killed in such a terrifying way.
But even knowing what end awaited her, she was all too weak.
A lone girl, without anybody to rely upon, unable to seek help, had to swallow her own predetermined death,
 and left this mortal coil.
She said she wanted to live.
She said she just wanted to live happily.
That's all she wanted.
She didn't ask for anything extravagant!
For any person that was ever born, it was the very basest of desires!!
 She never said a peep about wanting money or that she wished she was in somebody else's situation!!
She had said it.
That if all deaths were pre-ordained, then hers was probably also all according to plan.
She might have been a lone, frail girl, but I don't think she would have accepted it all without at least putting up a fight.
There must have been... in some small way...
 ...some form of resistance that she mustered.
And with what she could muster... seeking my help was part of that!!

<Akasaka>
"Goddammit!!!"
I howled.
I stomped the floor.
Why did I become a police officer in the first place?
How could I call myself an officer if I couldn't save a single girl from the misfortune that was awaiting her!?
Was it because there was so much going on at that time I couldn't process the fact that she was asking for help?
Yeah, that's right. I was still green!
If I was in that situation now, I would have definitely been able to help her!!
But... it was already all over.
Even if I wanted to settle the regrets she left behind, Hinamizawa, as a dangerous area, was still quarantined.
Most of the people involved were already dead, with the few that did remain spread around the country, unable to be traced.
The stage of that tragedy was still off limits as well.
The police investigation was put on hold, the case slowly being buried in the sands of time.
...Just like how I wouldn't have known unless Ooishi had asked me about it!!

<Ooishi>
"...Akasaka-san.
 ...Are you okay?"
At some point Ooishi had returned with a notebook in hand.
Until I saw the expression on Ooishi's face, I didn't realize that I was in tears.

<Akasaka>
"...I... never realized!!
 I never realized... she wanted help!!"

<Ooishi>
"...Akasaka-san.
 ...Calm down."

<Akasaka>
"But... it's all too late now!!
 She was killed!!
 In such an atrocious manner!!
 She was counting on me... but I couldn't save her!
 I couldn't save her!!!"

<Ooishi>
"...I might also be at fault for not building up an amicable relationship with the village.
 ...If Rika Furude had told me about it, I might have been able to extend a helping hand. 

<Ooishi>
...I wasn't able to build up enough trust for that.
 ...That's something I regret."
When Ooishi said the word "trust," it weighed on me even more.
Yes.
 She had given me her trust.
 She trusted me.
Meaning that she thought that I would have been able to ward off the fate of her foreseen death.
 She believed in that!
I cried. I fell to my hands and knees as I began to bawl.
...Eventually, Ooishi spoke quietly.

<Ooishi>
"Akasaka-san.
 ...Does it upset you?"

<Akasaka>
"...It does!!!"

<Ooishi>
"Then...
 ...there's only one way worth mentioning for Rika Furude to have her revenge."

<Akasaka>
"Is there really?
 Is there a way to do that!?"
Ooishi showed me the pen and notebook.

<Ooishi>
"...In order to properly mourn the death of Rika Furude, we have to at least find out the truth."

<Akasaka>
"...The truth..."

<Ooishi>
"Yes. And not just Rika Furude.
 Lots of people died.
 Their lament must be immeasurable.

<Ooishi>
But their deaths were left unsettled because of the disaster, and now we can't even investigate them, as their memory fades into oblivion.
 Many people died!! 

<Ooishi>
The ol' man was killed, Kuma-chan was erased. Everybody was a victim!!
 But the police can't even investigate it!!
 Who's going to take care of their parting regrets?
 Only we can!!
 Akasaka-san!!"

<Akasaka>
"...We find... the truth..."

<Ooishi>
"Yeah!!
 We'll find it! 

<Ooishi>
I've been around every one of the string of mysterious deaths, and know all of the inner workings of the village. You were told an important truth the year before they happened by Rika Furude!! We can do it!"

<Akasaka>
"...But ...they're already dead... ooh...!!"

<Ooishi>
"That's right.
 Rika Furude died.
 You were too inexperienced, so you couldn't save her!!"

<Akasaka>
"Wahhhhhhhhh!!!!"
Ooishi grabbed me, who was a wreck, and lifted me firmly by the lapels.

<Ooishi>
"That's why!!!
 To atone for that, we reveal the truth!!!
 If what you say is true, then all the incidents were part of some greater design!
 If that's the case, then how we investigate needs to change completely!! 

<Ooishi>
...I intend to spend tonight summarizing all the information you and I have, and then get in contact with one of my former subordinates first thing in the morning.
 ...We're not going to let the case go cold!! 

<Ooishi>
We're definitely going to crack it wide open!!"

<Akasaka>
"...Crack it open.
 ...Crack it open!!"

<Ooishi>
"We will.
 Several years have passed, but it's not beyond the statute of limitations.
 Even if the case has been postponed, it's not closed.
 It's still going.
 We're going to keep it going!!"

<Akasaka>
"Yeah... you're right!!
 Let's do it, Ooishi-san!
 I won't let it end like this!!
 I'm certain... we will uncover the truth!!
 We absolutely will!!!"
I demonstrated my resolve to Ooishi... by crying out those words.
And just then,

<Miyuki>
"...Papa?"
The sliding door behind me opened... and Miyuki revealed herself while sleepily rubbing her eyes. My shouting must have awoken her. Then she rushed over to me.

<Miyuki>
"What's wrong, Papa?
 ...Papa, why are you crying?"

<Akasaka>
"Ah... Oh.
 It's nothing, Miyuki. It's nothing..."
I tried hard to smile while wiping away my tears. And though Miyuki looked like she was about to cry herself, she extended her little hand to me.

<Miyuki>
"Are you all right?
 ...Did you have another scary dream?
 Don't cry, Papa..."

<Akasaka>
"......"
And when she makes that gesture toward me... I saw the figure of another girl overlapping with her.
And her... innocent gaze and innocent expression felt frustratingly nostalgic, filling me with painful torment.
A girl who couldn't be here because I didn't reach out to her.
She borrowed my daughter's body to offer me words of comfort...

<Rika>
"...Akasaka.
 Please don't cry."
It might be a hallucination.
Maybe a convenient illusion formed from my selfish dreams.
However.
That was her voice... I'm certain I heard it.
Rather than blaming me for my mistake... she was compassionate.

<Akasaka>
(...Aah, why am I crying?
 After all, I have something more important to do than crying!!)

<Akasaka>
"...Miyuki.
 Before you were born... Papa met a girl in Hinamizawa who was like an angel."

<Miyuki>
"An angel? Really?!"

<Akasaka>
"Yeah, she was cute, and kind...
 I wanted her to meet you, Miyuki..."
Right... that's already an impossible wish.
That future is already gone.

<Miyuki>
"Hee~!
 Then I want to be friends with that girl!"

<Akasaka>
"Eh...?"

<Miyuki>
"Ehehe... I'm looking forward to it!
 Next time you go, take me with you!
 To Hinamizawa...!"
Even so... there's still something I can do...!!

<Akasaka>
"...
 Ah, of course...
 We'll meet her together, someday.
 ...I'm sure of it...!!"

<Miyuki>
"Yep♪."
Some day, I'm sure.
 We will see her again.
That summer,
 the higurashi cried
 in Hinamizawa...
Ooishi and I vowed to bring the truth of the case to light, and stood up.
Everything ended in 1985.
I, at least wanting to apologize, had searched for her grave.
After the state autopsy, her remains were entrusted to one of the shrine's followers.
In the future, when the quarantine on the Hinamizawa area was lifted, they would be returned to her family grave.
However, unsure who exactly took the remains of Rika Furude, until today I couldn't even apologize to her.
In the future, when the quarantine on Hinamizawa is lifted...
 all I could do then was wait until whoever that person is returned to the grave.
What I could do right now was not apologize to her.
Instead, until I was able to meet her again... I would reveal the truth and dispel her regrets.
Even now, sporadic eruptions of gas in the Hinamizawa area meant that the prospect of the quarantine being lifted wasn't happening anytime soon.
Most likely... it seemed that she had no intention of meeting me again until I found the truth.
That's why the quarantine wouldn't be lifted, or so I thought.
Until the day I grasped the truth.
It was the following year.
Ooishi and I co-authored a book on the string of mysterious deaths leading up to the Great Hinamizawa Disaster.
I decided on the title.
"Higurashi - When They Cry"
That was because for those few days I was in Hinamizawa, the sound that I remembered the most was the cry of the higurashi.
I could only wish that based on this book, those people involved with that incident could refresh their memories, and bring to light a new truth.
And more importantly: that nothing like this ever happens again.
I wrote this in the afterword:
This year, the quarantine on Hinamizawa still hasn't been lifted.



[Himatsubushi Bad-End]

Shit... Shit, shit, shit...!
I can't afford to die in a place like this!!
I need to survive and return to Yukie's side!!
"........."
For a moment, I catch a glimmer of hesitation in the eyes of the man holding the gun.
This guy's... unsure about shooting at me...?!
If so, maybe if I jump at him now, ...I could—!!

<Akasaka>
"Uwoaaaaahhhhhh!!!"

<Kidnapper>
"Wha—?!
 Tch, ya damn bastaaaaaaaarrrrd!!"

<Akasaka>
"........."
In a flash.
Everything before me grows dark, ...as my consciousness leaves me behind.
It was only after my body temperature rapidly came down and a burning sensation in my chest turned numb, that I realized I had been shot....



[Himatsubushi tip - 01]

<Yukie>
"...Oh really?
 It's tough when it's such a sudden assignment...
 Please be careful.
 Where are you headed?
 You're already there?"

<Akasaka>
"..."
Whenever I headed out on assignment, she would ask where.
...Not just Yukie, but anybody would have asked the same question.
If it was a cold place, she would urge me to pack a thick jacket.
If it was far, she'd warn me to be careful on the drive over.
...It was just normal everyday concern that led to asking such an obvious thing.
I felt sad that I couldn't answer such a run-of-the-mill question.

<Yukie>
"...Sorry.
 It's something that you can't talk about, isn't it...
 Please be careful."

<Akasaka>
"...Sorry, Yukie."

<Yukie>
"...At some point, you started apologizing right away.
 Even though when you first started your job you were all gung-ho about it.
 ...Hee hee."
Yukie laughed as though she had realized something.
At times like this, Yukie had the magical power to see right through me.

<Yukie>
"...It's already been quite a while since I was admitted to the hospital.
 Are you finally getting lonely?"

<Akasaka>
"D-Don't tease me.
 I'm too old to get lonely..."

<Yukie>
"...Hee hee. Oh really?
 You actually like to be doted on, don't you...?
 Don't you start getting a little faint of heart when I'm not around?
 Hee hee hee."

<Akasaka>
"...Aww, geez...
 I can see the little devil horns sprouting from your head right now...
 You've always been like this."

<Yukie>
"...You can't hide it, you can't hide it.
 If I don't play with you, you get aaaallll lonely.
 I can hear your tail wagging over the phone.
 Hee hee hee..."
This side of Yukie wasn't something you could guess existed from seeing her usual modest behavior, and it was something that she didn't show to anybody else but me.
Normally I'd poke her to hide my embarrassment and bring an end to the conversation, but I couldn't do that over the phone.
...Of course, Yukie was clever.
 She was teasing me because of that.

<Yukie>
"...Hee hee hee.
 I wonder when I figured out that giving you grief was this much fun..."

<Akasaka>
"Give me a break...
 ...In any case, it's good to hear you so lively."

<Yukie>
"...I know, right?
 ...Did I cheer you up?"
I had called Yukie to keep her from feeling lonely when she was by herself in the hospital room.
...Of course that was nothing more than a pretense that I, being shy, had come up with.
 It seemed that Yukie had long since seen through that act.

<Akasaka>
"...Yeah."

<Yukie>
"Please phone again...
 When I'm not feeling up to it, I'll get my father to talk with you. 

<Yukie>
...Although, if you're talking with my father, I get the feeling that you'd be standing at attention on the other side of the line.
 Hee hee hee."
For a while longer, Yukie kept teasing me without letting me end the call...



[Himatsubushi tip - 02]
Chairman XX,
 Members of the XX Party,
 Congratulations are due, as we are celebrating 25 years since our founding.
These past 25 years have seen much growth in XX Prefecture.
The once quiet scenery of nothing but fields,
 now has seen the opening of a new stop for the bullet train, 
and with the development of the highway, we've seen the rebirth of a modern city bursting with youthful energy.
We've reaped the benefits of new businesses and industry.
And with the special reverence the residents of XX Prefecture have for time-honored traditions-- 
history and culture, business and industry--with these ideals in harmony, they have accomplished in growing their city into one of Japan's foremost metropolises.
Of course, the development of XX Prefecture couldn't have happened without the growth of the XX Party.
We are resolved to see every one of our campaign promises to fruition,
 reaching our targets definitively and expediently like arrows fired from a bow.
With these arrows as the fundamental bases of the XX Party, our members have sought to pierce the obstructions preventing the happiness of the residents of XX Prefecture.
But I do believe that everybody here is unlike an ordinary arrow.
While being as unfaltering and straightforward, we have not neglected in seeking solutions that conform to the current day and age while also keeping an eye on the future.
An arrow, once loosed, can only fly to its destination.
Everyone here, however, is no simple arrow.
Even once loosed from the bow, without neglecting our studies,
 while employing new methods, 
and implementing more effective and flexible ideas, thus being able to change trajectories midflight-- we are magical arrows.
The modern age marches ever forward.
Sometimes it marches faster than the time taken from planning to execution.
(The following part was not in the script.
 It is thought to have been ad-libbed by the Minister.)
For example, there have recently been numerous problems with the Hinamizawa Power Plant Project. 
Rather than forcing through the project solely because it was decided upon by the government, it is necessary to reflect on and adjust to the ever-changing needs of the residents, the region, and the next generation.
The protests by the local residents that surround the Hinamizawa Dam,
 these are also the will of the people of XX Prefecture. 
If you feel that there is no need to listen because the project has already been finalized, then you do nothing more than shed a poor light on Japan's postwar democracy.
(The following is as per the script.)
For the lasting happiness of the citizens of Japan and the residents of XX Prefecture, please consider these policies thoroughly.
I believe, however, we have all gained something from the flexibility and foresight of the XX Party.
I've taken up much of your time,
 however, allow me to say the following to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our founding.
Chairman XX,
 members of the XX Party in attendance,
 thank you very much for today.
--From the opening remarks of the XX Party Prefectural Forum and 25th Anniversary Celebration.



[Himatsubushi tip - 03]
The world is filled with people blessed with relationships.
Of course, that doesn't mean that everyone is connected to each other.
It's obvious that on the other side of the planet, there are people laughing and crying who can't possibly have an effect on you.
However, in the extremely limited community of the neighborhood, that sort of connection is just a matter of fact.
It's quite possible that a single remarkable event could have massive consequences inside a small community.
If you were to increase that in scale... a perfect stranger on the other side of the globe might become enough of a legend to have an effect on our lives.
Well, it's not always that way.
Like I said at the beginning, the links between people basically aren't that relevant in the grand scheme of things.
Whether some household nearby is having steak or croquettes doesn't matter to me.
When I put on my shoes, it doesn't matter to anybody whether I put the right one on first or the left.
...This much the average person can understand.
But actually, in reality, this is the truth.
 The bonds between people are quite well defined.
It's not just a matter of distance, of being far or near.
For example, let's say that Person A's actions have some effect on me.
Even then, Person B's actions could have absolutely no consequence on my life.
The reverse also holds true. Just because my actions affect Person A, that doesn't always mean that they affect Person B as well.
Let's put it bluntly.
If the bonds between people are like gears in a machine...
The gear that represents me meshes with some people, but is isolated from others.
There are some who would try arguing against this.
Those people would bring up the example of gears in a clock.
Each gear indeed only directly meshes with one or two others...
However, if you rotate one gear, the one next to it is moved, which connects to the next one, and the next... in the end, all the gears are moving.
...There is a logic behind this, more than enough to convince the average person.
Why is the argument convincing?
...The answer is simple.
The relationships between people are ambiguous, and can only be described conceptually.
How the gears are connected and how their movements are chained together can't be used as a fundamental explanation, so it throws a wet blanket on that argument.
So for the people who like that explanation, I'll use the example of a clock again to refute it.
First of all, to say that this world is a singular clock would be wrong.
That is, there isn't only one clock.
There exist many clocks in this world, each counting their own time.
If you think about it, the idea that this world is just one big clock is the height of arrogance.
Even if you use the analogy of gears to explain human relationships,
 then you should be able to explain it using an analogy of multiple clocks unrelated to a single gear.
Neighbors A and B.
A is a gear in the same clock as me, so it's best to remain civil.
B is a gear in a different clock, so he doesn't really matter to me at all.
That's the kind of clear distinction I'm talking about.
You want to say I'm being fallacious?
Then let's change the analogy to something more familiar, so you can understand.
You've probably heard the phrase "a fire on the opposite shore" sometime in your life, no?
For example, if your neighbor's house was on fire, you'd probably try and help to put it out, wouldn't you?
 It'd be awful if the fire spread and burned down your own house, after all.
But what if that fire was in a town on the opposite side of a river?
Would you still go out of your way to help?
 You wouldn't, would you?
 Even though it would be the wrong thing to do, there's no way the fire could spread to your own house.
Even if it turned into a huge conflagration, there's no relation between the houses that will spread fire to yours and those that won't.
With this basic example, you should be able to see the difference between gears that are or aren't related to your own.
...Having said that, there's still a lot to think about, even without a river to divide it.
After all, it's not a spatial problem like being on the other side of the river, is it?



[Himatsubushi tip - 04]
The car had stopped.
But he didn't know any more than that.
For not only was he blindfolded, but locked in the trunk of the car.
How could people become this powerless just by being robbed of their sight?
 He absolutely wouldn't have known this without experiencing it firsthand.
He soon realized it was pointless to try and undo his bonds, with the confines of the trunk quickly making him lightheaded.
 He had no choice but to let this mild torture dull his senses.
That's why, when the car stopped and the unpleasant vibration ceased as the engine was killed,
 he couldn't help but delude himself that he was being set free, even though nothing had been resolved in reality.
Of course, he was soon removed from that delusion.
He strained his ears when he heard one of the men who had abducted him and an older man he was hearing for the first time strike up a conversation...

<Man>
"...Nice to see you.
 The chick is in the trunk.
 He struggled so much that he's probably exhausted right now, but there's not a mark on him, just as ordered."

<Man>
"...Ohh, musta been a handful."
The trunk opened, letting in a blast of fresh, cool air.
Even though up until just now he had been thinking about getting out of that stuffy trunk, when it was actually opened, he suddenly became uneasy.
...Enough so that he wished that the lid of the trunk would once again close, separating himself from them.
Suddenly, somebody stroked his head.
Of course, since he was blindfolded, he couldn't tell if the hand was petting him or simply evaluating how easy it would be to remove his scalp. 
Unable to tell the difference, he could only freeze as he imagined the worst-case scenario...

<Man>
"...Poor li'l bugger...
 'E's shakin'...
 Jus' stay calm for a bit..."
The older man said that kindly as he gently stroked the boy's head.

<Man>
"This mus' be real tough for ya...
 But ya see, yer gramps is a nice man.
 'E'll 'elp ya soon enough..."
Having heard nothing but the average standard dialect his whole life, the older man's distinct intonation left a deep impression on the boy.
But he had no idea what he was saying.
For 'yer gramps' to register as meaning 'your grandfather' took a while to process...
Eventually, the hand that was stroking his head loosened the blindfold.

<Man>
"...Can't keep his eyes covered...
 if he splits his face open it'd be bad."

<Man>
"Hm... An' with tha'...
 We migh' as well take out tha gag.
 'E kent breathe like tha'..."

<Man>
"...It'll be trouble if he yells...
 Leave him to us..."

<Man>
"...Geez, ya guys dunno how ta treat somebody!!
 ...Tha main family said no rough stuff.
 Ya better remember tha' well..."

<Man>
"Yeah.
 We won't do anything stupid.
 ...As long as the kid cooperates, that is."
The man's hand prodded roughly and repeatedly at the boy's head.
A rugged hand, unlike the affectionate one that had been stroking his head before.
Just stay cooperative.
If you struggle, there's no guarantee what will happen.
 That cliched threat was literally beaten into his head.



[Himatsubushi tip - 05]
The sound of the car grew closer, followed by the sound of it braking as the engine cut out.
At that moment, his up-until-now lackadaisical footsteps grew decisive as the man in the room dashed up to the wall beside the window and carefully peered outside...
...It was his comrade's car.
Even so, he still didn't relax his guard.
Eventually, the sound of footsteps approached the door.
 ...Thump,
 thump thump thump.
 It was the passcode.

<Man>
"...I'm back.
 Open tha door already."

<Man>
"Ahh, you must be tired.
 I'm opening it now."
After the locks were undone and the door opened, a man appeared, his arms laden with swollen plastic grocery bags.
The bags in his hands had "Sevens Mart" written on them, with bread and milk cartons able to be glimpsed within.
The contents of those bags were then spread out over a sheet on the floor.

<Man>
"I bough' some cup noodles, so go boil some water.
 ...Whas' the kid doin'?"

<Man>
"Hm?
 He's been sleeping the entire time.
 Thank god he's not causing any trouble.
 He did struggle a bit when he was about to shit himself."

<Man>
"Don' let 'im crap 'is pants.
 It'd suck if it started smellin' like an outhouse in 'ere."

<Man>
"...Yeah, I know."

<Man>
"Check tha gag every now and then.
 We don' wan' it ta get loose, so keep it tigh'...
 but not so tigh' that 'e stops breathin'."

<Man>
"I said, I know...
 Huh? Didn't I ask you to pick up another can of gas for the portable stove?
 We're out."

<Man>
"Ya never asked, ya ijit."

<Man>
"...Gaah... seriously? Come on, work....
 Dammit!!"
He rattled the portable stove as he struggled to get it to light.
...Seeing that, the man who went to buy supplies let out a deep sigh.
And with a backwards glance at that sight, began to walk to the corner of the room.
...The kidnapped boy was sprawled out on a sheet that was spread out on the floor.

<Man>
"....Boy,
 ya doin' okay?"
Of course, the man didn't assume the kid was able to hear that question.
That was because the boy's ears were plugged, with his eyes and ears thoroughly covered by packing tape.
Also, his mouth was gagged with a thin, twisted-up towel.
...Because of that, the boy was unable to close his mouth properly, his cheeks sticky with his own saliva.
Of course, that wasn't the only reason.
Both his arms were tied tightly behind his back with a leather belt.

<Man>
"Ya seem ta be doin' okay.
 At leas',  yer not gonna die.
 ..If yer grampa wanted to play tough, we migh' have had ta lop off an ear.. it'd be great if we don' have ta... 

<Man>
If tha Main Family says we do, though... tough luck.
 ...I can' even imagine wha' kind of cruel things they'd have us do. 

<Man>
...Tha Family says not one scratch on 'im though, so it seems to be going well for tha time bein'..."

<Man>
"The Minister is discretely withdrawing the dam project.
 The Hinamizawa Dam is indefinitely postponed.
 ...I wonder when we're letting the boy go.
 ...I just want to be done with this already."

<Man>
"Tha Main Family seem ta be gaugin' tha timin'.
 I don' know when it'll be, but prob'ly soon."

<Man>
"Isn't that great, kid?
 You'll be let go real soon, heh heh heh..."
The men didn't know if their voices were heard by the boy.
...For him, there was nothing he could do but continue to sleep to escape his harsh reality...

<Man>
"More importan'ly, wha' are we gonna do about tha gas?
 We can' eat the cup noodles raw!!
 If we're out of gas say something, geez!!"



[Himatsubushi tip - 06]
The weather forecast had predicted that it wouldn't rain at all this entire week.
It's not that I hate sunny days or anything.
When every day is the same, unchanging, sunny weather, however, anybody would long for a rain cloud or two.
If it's simply clear skies for a week, a month, a year--anybody would long for a rain cloud or two.
The weather specialist said that they had carefully scrutinized a large quantity of past data, so it wouldn't be so likely for the forecast to be wrong.
 I knew as much.
...But even then, there was occasionally a day where I was hoping that it would be wrong, as I stared up into the clear blue sky.
Was I being mischievous in hoping so?
I waited and waited, feeling almost suffocated by the boring blue sky undisturbed by a single cloud.
If you could die from that suffocating feeling...
 then the population of Earth probably wouldn't have increased to this point.
In other words... the only person who was being suffocated by this was me.
And so...
I welcomed the summer evenings where not even the weather forecast could predict a sudden shower.
If I were to explain it like this, would you understand a bit more about how I feel?
Let's say that tonight's dinner was going to be curry rice.
But, when you're called down to the dinner table, what was waiting for you was instead an eggplant and bell pepper stirfry.
This is just on your mother's whim, by the way.
I would be delighted by such whimsy.
 I don't really like eggplants or bell peppers, but still, I would be delighted.
The fact that that the pre-established routine of curry rice had been broken would be amusing.
If tonight was repeated a hundred times, and a hundred times you had to eat curry rice...
Yet for just this one night, that was changed to an eggplant and bell pepper stirfry,
 there's no way you couldn't enjoy that chance happening.
I hate pre-established routines.
I really hate when things are all decided beforehand.
I have no love for boredom.
I always get my hopes up that something today will be different from yesterday, no matter how trivial.
It's been decided that this entire week starting today was going to be clear skies.
The weather forecast decided upon it, so the God of Weather must also feel obliged to do so.
But who's to say that a rain cloud might not just show up one day on a whim?
...It's something that nobody can say for sure, but because that thought remains in this world, a creature such as myself can continue living without being suffocated.
Tomorrow will probably be a hot and clear day.
However, I'm the only one that knows that predetermined fate, even with but a slim 1% chance... sometimes changes.
Hoping for that 1%, I hung up upside-down weather charms on my sunlit eavestroughs.
In the end, I spend my days waiting for those unexpected things in life to happen.
I pondered why I was hoping for it...
Why was I hoping for a rain cloud?
...The answer was simple.
 I've had my fill of clear skies.
Then why was I hoping for a rain cloud?
...The answer was simple.
 The fact that it was going to be sunny tomorrow was boring.
So why was I hoping for a rain cloud?
In the end, it doesn't really matter whether it rains or shines tomorrow.
Basically, it was just that the rain would water my heart, which was withered from boredom.
That's why rather than a TV drama where the plot's already been decided...
...I prefer to look up at the sky.



[Himatsubushi tip - 07]

<Irie>
"Your blood pressure has improved.
 For you to recover this quickly at your age, I'm rather impressed.

<Irie>
At this rate, you'll still be kicking after a couple hundred more years, Oryou-san."
The young doctor in his medical coat said that as he undid the blood pressure cuff from the arm of the old woman tucked away in her futon.

<Oryou>
"You're a very good physician, Dr. Irie...
 If a persistent ol' fart like me doesn't hurry up and die, I'll just be in the way of you young folk...
 ...Ho ho ho ho..."
The old lady, Oryou, laughed faintly with a broad smile on her face.
Then, turning towards the sliding door, she called out in a strong voice.

<Oryou>
"Is Shimiko-san or Taeko-san there?
 Bring some tea for Dr. Irie!"
The sound of rushed footsteps from the hallway drew closer, until finally the door slid smoothly open.
What it revealed was a young girl.
 ...It looked like the old lady's granddaughter.

<Mion>
"Shimiko-san already left for the day.
 ...Do you need something?"

<Oryou>
"Mion, make some barley tea for Dr. Irie."

<Mion>
"Okay, got it.
 Did you want some too, Granny?
 Or would black tea be better?
 Want lots of milk and sugar?"

<Oryou>
"I'll measure it out myself, so you don't have to put any in.
 Just bring the sugar jar and some milk when you bring the tea."

<Mion>
"Kay kay."
The girl named Mion, after giving a rather uninterested response to her taskmaster of a grandmother, returned to the hallway.

<Oryou>
"Pour the doctor's tea in the cups for the guests!!
 And make sure you bring a coaster too!
 Also make sure to dry the outside of the glass, okay!?"

<Mion>
"Yeah, yeah.
 You're such a fussypants."
A tired voice wafted a reply from down the hallway.
The apathetic tone of voice was far from unusual.
 The old lady let a wry smile slip across her face as she chided the girl.

<Oryou>
"Geez, that girl just won't learn.
 Nothing I ever scold her about sticks."

<Irie>
"Now now, Oryou-san... you don't have to say that.
 Mion-chan is doing her best in her own way, even though she's so young."

<Oryou>
"Her mother was the same way... couldn't teach her anything.
 The apple doesn't fall far from the tree!"

<Irie>
"Aha ha ha ha.
 So her mother's mother must be exactly the same, no?"
The old lady burst out laughing.
 Her expression showed she hadn't taken the comment the wrong way.

<Oryou>
"Dr. Irie.
 I'm sorry, but could you open the doors for me?
 It seems there's a nice cool breeze outside."
The cool chirping of the higurashi had at some point started leaking through the gap in the doorway.
Irie stood up, and opened the door a bit.
...A refreshing breeze pushed out the stale air that had built up in the room.

<Irie>
"It's gotten fairly hot during the day, but the evenings are still rather cool, aren't they.
 It was almost downright chilly last night."

<Oryou>
"Yeah.
 ...Those types of mornings and evenings are another one of Hinamizawa's fine points."
Irie replied with a smile as he returned to sit on the cushion beside the old lady.
And then the two of them, for a little while, soaked in the voices of the higurashi...

<Oryou>
"I'm going to try and live to a hundred.
 ...Until the business with the dam is proper finished, I ain't kicking the bucket just yet."

<Irie>
"...To get the government to withdraw a decision they've already made is a fairly difficult thing to do..."

<Oryou>
"The way this country does things is like turning a millstone.
 A heavy one at that."

<Irie>
"...A millstone?"

<Oryou>
"Don'tcha know??
 A millstone."
Irie quickly affirmed that of course he knew what the old lady was talking about.
For he knew full well that Oryou didn't like having her stories interrupted.

<Oryou>
"This millstone, see, can grind anything to a pulp.
 It's rather impressive.
 But y'see, it doesn't turn that easy, because it's a rather heavy millstone. 

<Oryou>
Lots of people have to work in unison to get it to even budge. It's that type of millstone."
Irie pursed his lips, listening quietly to what she was saying.
Eventually Mion returned with some tea laid out on a tray.
Seeing that Oryou was talking and in a good mood, she quietly knelt down and laid out the sets for the barley and black tea, careful not to interrupt.

<Oryou>
"That's why, when it gets going, it's not that easy to stop.
 ...It takes the most effort to move it right before it starts turning.
 Everybody hates that, so everybody keeps pushing it along without rest."

<Mion>
"You're talking about friction, right?
 I get what you're saying."

<Oryou>
"So in other words.
 If there's some sort of mistake, and the millstone suddenly stops turning... to get it turning again takes a great deal of power, more'r less."

<Irie>
"...Certainly, to get a project that's been suspended going again takes quite a lot of work."

<Oryou>
"It's a millstone that isn't easily stopped.
 ...But once it's stopped, it'll never turn again.
 It's that kind of millstone."

<Irie>
"It'd be nice if there was some way to get that millstone to stop, wouldn't it?"
When Irie responded with that, Mion and the old lady suddenly sunk into silence...
Irie, instinctively thinking he had said something rude, searched in a small panic for the words to correct himself.
But that silence wasn't the result of rude words.
...For what crept across Mion and the old lady's faces were contemptuous smiles.

<Mion>
"...

<Mion>
 ..."
The atmosphere surrounding Irie suddenly froze, leaving him flabbergasted.
...Thinking that the scornful smiles creeping across both of their faces was the result of some mistake of his, he could only grow afraid.
"...
 ......"

<Irie>
"...Haha, hahahahahahaha..."
It hadn't been that long at all since he was enveloped by silence.
However, unable to stand it, Irie could only let out a weak laugh.
Irie's laugh eventually spread to Mion and the old lady.
 Not knowing exactly what they were laughing at,
 their laughter left a lingering chill.
...The only ones not laughing were the higurashi, who continued their simple and unchanging chorus...



[Himatsubushi tip - 08]

<Chief>
"...Yeah.
 Yesterday, when we met at the restaurant in Ginza,
 that topic popped up."

<Kanou>
"That's overstepping their boundaries, isn't it?
 They're meddling too much with Public Safety.
 If they keep doing that, they're going to set a bad precedent."

<Chief>
"It seems that Minister Inukai is openly uncomfortable about the way Public Safety is doing things.
 The Vice-Minister is probably going to say something to that effect during Monday's debate session. 

<Chief>
...But what can you do?"

<Kanou>
"We can only have the Director address the Vice-Minister.
 That's why we pay him the big bucks."

<Chief>
"Well, if it comes to that, they're going to ask him for proof that the Minister's being threatened."

<Kanou>
"Sometimes I don't know what side he's on.
 If he's not on ours, then what?"

<Chief>
"Well, he's probably getting some pressure from the Minister.
 We'll probably just have to proceed with the investigation while he sweats it out in the Vice-Minister's office and buys us some time. 

<Chief>
...He might get so wrung out to dry that all that'll be left are dregs, though.
 ...So, how's the investigation going?"

<Kanou>
"All the juicy leads I was pinning my hopes on turned out to be duds. Honestly, I'm at a loss."

<Chief>
"There are reports that the Hinamizawa Dam Project has been showing up a lot lately in the Minister's press releases, so what about that?"

<Kanou>
"....Hmmm...
 Well you say 'showing up,' but it's really more of a very slight feeling that something's strange. 

<Kanou>
He just happened to mention it during his speech at the XX Prefectural Forum, so it just might have been something that he was mentioning because it was relevant at the time."

<Chief>
"If I remember correctly, a local organization there was protesting quite violently, no?
 The Onigafuchi Guardians.
 I think Akasaka-kun was investigating that."

<Kanou>
"I think those guys could possibly be behind what's happening now.
 Even if we can't say there's anything overtly suspicious about them, it might not be prudent to remove them from the picture... 

<Kanou>
Akasaka-kun reported in passing that he couldn't deny that possibility."

<Chief>
"...Then, isn't there merit in investigating them?
 We're going through everything with a fine-toothed comb, so if they're one of the suspicious groups that're left, we'll eventually have to."

<Kanou>
"Well, they're not the only group we should investigate, right?
 Ahahaha!

<Kanou>
If we're just talking about groups that are as suspicious as Onigafuchi, there's quite a few of them.
 We don't have the men, the time, or the money for it all."

<Chief>
"I'll try asking for more details from Akasaka-kun.
 ...I feel like we should pay some extra attention to this Guardians."

<Kanou>
"He's reported that he's established a rapport with the villagers.
 It also seems that he's collaborating with the local police."

<Chief>
"Keep your contact with Akasaka-kun on the down-low.
 Also, if there's anything in his info that merits investigation, it's possible we can send reinforcements."

<Kanou>
"Got it.

<Kanou>
 ...Ah, sorry... Chief Kataoka~!
 There's a phone call from the Director.

<Kanou>
 Should I transfer it over here?"

<Chief>
"Ah, no, it's okay!
 I'll head over there.
 ...Yes hello?"



[Himatsubushi tip - 09]
Do you believe that there are choices in life?
There are many people who lament the following:
If there only existed points in life where there were clear choices to make, we would be able to scrutinize those carefully and make decisions that would lead us to a better future.
Every time I hear people lament as such, I cast it off as a rather trivial worry.
Even if you were given a clear choice, it wouldn't be meaningful at all, and there wouldn't be any such path to a better future.
...Is this hard to understand?
Then let's pretend that in front of you there are two strange boxes.
In other words, you have two clear choices.
Do you open the red box, or the blue box?
A lot of things would be uncertain even with that choice, wouldn't they?
If you don't have the option of opening neither, then your choice boils down to the natural impulse of opening the box that holds the better result for you.
Then, after examining the shape and features of each, and pondering a great many things, you have to pick either the red or the blue.
...If this was you, which box would you open?
Red or blue?
...If you were to go by their traditional meanings, then red would be a dangerous, threatening color.
However, that doesn't automatically mean that it would be calm and relaxing inside the blue box, either.
In fact, it might even be that the colors are a trap, make you wary of the red box and have you open the blue.
A trap?
...Could it be the contents of the box aren't a reward, but rather a penalty?
See...? Now you're at a loss.
You're so conflicted over the choice between red and blue that you've started wishing there was an option to open neither and just leave.
But there isn't.
 You have to open either the red box or the blue box.
Oh, I forgot to say this, but if you choose one box, the other will disappear.
So you'll never know the contents of the box you don't open.
 I'll just put that rule at the end there for you.
Now.
 Why don't you choose?
The red box, or the blue box?
...It's all right, you won't lose anything by picking either one.
 ...Come on now.
Have you thought about it?
In the end, you chose this color, didn't you?
...As soon as you chose, the other box disappeared.
So you can give up on the contents of that one, okay?
That's the rule.
Now, open up the box you chose.
Inside the box there was...
 a piece of caramel.
Have you thought about it?
In the end, you chose this color, didn't you?
...As soon as you chose, the other box disappeared.
So you can give up on the contents of that one, okay?
That's the rule.
Now, open up the box you chose.
Inside the box there was...
 a stick of chewing gum.
...I know you're a little disappointed.
Well that's only natural.
No matter how you look at it, it looks like you drew the dud.
The correct box might have had a bar of chocolate in it, for all you know.
No, in fact, something incredible like a pair of tickets to Hawaii might have been in there.
But even if you wanted to verify that, the other box has already disappeared.
There's no way you can check now.
But if you think about it from an optimistic point of view...
Just maybe... the other box was empty, and this box was the winner.
And being satisfied (or perhaps not) with such a cheap prize, you pop it into your mouth and start chewing it happily.
So, what do you think in the end?
If you were given a second chance, would you try to open the other box?
...But unfortunately, the chance to choose between the red box or the blue box has come and gone, never to be seen again.
The chance to change your selection will never come.
Don't your parents often say: Every choice you make in life only happens once, so choose carefully?
Hee hee hee...
See?
 Choices aren't that great after all.
 ...Aren't you a little disillusioned now?
 Ahhahahahahaha...
...Right now you're thinking: "That's it?"
That's right, the contents of the red box and the blue box were a piece of caramel and a stick of chewing gum.
You might have thought you made the wrong choice before, but now seeing them together like this, you can't really say that either choice was the wrong one.
Well, I guess everybody has their personal preferences.
If you prefer caramel to gum, for example.
...You're definitely thinking of choosing to open the box again based on that preference.
...The clear choices you wanted were basically this.
The selfish desire to open up both boxes and compare the contents, then pick the one most suited to you.
But you see,
 reality is the same as this game.
If you pick one, the one you didn't choose disappears.
 So there's no way you could check the result.
If at that time,
 if you had done this,
 or perhaps if you had done that...
 then it wouldn't be hard to imagine that you could be happier (or perhaps less happy) than you are right now.
In the end, you only have the pleasure of approving of or being disappointed by the choice that you did make.
But that's fine.
After all, didn't you enjoy the thrill of making the choice?
If, like now, you knew the contents of both boxes,
 then the choice between the red box or the blue box would just be a waste of time.
Because instead of this boring game about boxes, you could be looking at the quickly-changing evening summer sky, listening for the distant sound of thunder, and pondering if it's going to rain or not... that would be much more fun.



[Himatsubushi tip - 10]

<Government Official>
"...Uh-huh, yes.
 ...So the wake will be from six PM tomorrow, and the service will be the day after from noon until one.
 The venue will be Okinomiya Ceremony Hall..."

<Oryou>
"...I see.
 It's Deputy Mayor Ikezawa's grandson's funeral we're talking about. We have to pay our respects.
 Mion, I'll have you go in my stead."

<Mion>
"Okay, got it.
 Should I wear mourning clothes?
 How much should I bring for the funeral offering?"

<Oryou>
"You can go in your school uniform.
 Make sure you button it up properly.
 For the money, fifty--
 No... a hundred thousand yen.
 They've done a lot for us."
Mion quietly whistled in awe at the exorbitant amount of money her grandmother was offering.

<Oryou>
"Ikezawa-san's been a prudent person ever since his days as head of the Okinomiya Municipal Office.
 ...Even if those government-types paid me a visit, they'd always stay outside. 

<Oryou>
But whenever I offered Ikezawa-san a cup of tea, he'd come inside and carefully listen to what I had to say.
 ...He always lent a proper ear to what people had to say. Others should learn from a person like him."
The two guests made a show of nodding, making it clear they were paying attention as Oryou reminisced.
The sight of them trying not to get on Oryou's bad side was humorous enough to elicit laughter from Mion occasionally.

<Oryou>
"How young was Deputy Mayor Ikezawa's grandson when he died?"

<Government Official>
"...Umm...
 11 years old, apparently..."
Oryou closed her eyes and shook her head lightly, lamenting the loss of such a young life.

<Oryou>
"If I recall correctly, he said he only had one grandchild....
 ...how sad...
 there's nothing worse for a parent than outliving their offspring."

<Mion>
"Ahahaha.
 You're really nice to other people, Granny.
 If Shion or I died, would you be this sad?"

<Oryou>
"Don't be stupid.
 Saying something like that is bad luck!"
Having got the reaction she expected, Mion cackled.
The two guests, unsure if they were supposed to laugh along, instead forced awkward smiles.

<Government Official>
"We'll take our leave for today, then...
 We'll be by tomorrow evening at five to pick you up.
 Until then...
 please excuse us..."
After bowing their heads repeatedly, the guests left by the front door.
Mion saw them off, waving her little hand goodbye.

<Mion>
"...They're gone.
 ...It must be rough for them to pay you a courtesy visit, Granny.
 It would have been fine if they just broke the news over the phone.
 Heh heh heh..."
Well, it was true that Oryou Sonozaki was a central person for both her relatives and the residents of Hinamizawa Village as a whole.
As a voting bloc, they numbered in the several thousands.
It wasn't hard to imagine the mayor would try to pander to her.
Unlike Mion, however, Oryou was looking up longingly at the sky from the veranda.

<Mion>
"What's the matter?
 Are you going senile?
 Ahahahaha!"

<Oryou>
"...I just thought that no matter whose grandchild it was... I'd feel sorry for them..."
Saying that, she let out a deep sigh.
Mion was let down, as normally her grandmother would have scolded her for her attitude.

<Oryou>
"Mion.
 ...You know... that Minister's grandson.
 How long has it been since he was abducted?"

<Mion>
"Hmm.
 ...Four days, maybe?"
Oryou let out another deep sigh.

<Oryou>
"He may be the grandchild of our bitter enemy... but I still feel sorry for him."

<Mion>
"....Really?"

<Oryou>
"That's enough of a warning.
 ...We should bring this to an end soon."

<Mion>
"..."
The playful expression drained from Mion's face, leaving behind a stern one.
And then, as if to ascertain Oryou's will, looked into her eyes.
...Oryou, expressing her intention with only those eyes, looked back into Mion's.

<Oryou>
"...I want some tea, could you call for some?
 Some of that chocolate too."
Mion gave a small nod, then turned around.

<Mion>
"Shimiko-san, are you there?
 Grandma wants some tea, could you prepare some?"
From far away, a voice responded in the affirmative.
Mion, after confirming she'd been heard, picked up the phone and began dialing.

<Mion>
"....Ah, hello?
 This is Mion.
 ...Yeah.
 ...Is my father there?"



[Himatsubushi tip - 11]
Patients admitted to the hospital can only accept calls at fixed times.
...That's why she wouldn't be receiving a call from him today.
Yesterday, she had teased him that he got lonely easily, so he might have struggled with the idea of calling her sooner.
That was much easier to imagine, rather than that he might just be too busy to call.
...Because he's just that type of person.
 Yukie, whispering that, smiled to herself.
The announcement that visiting hours were over played over the hospital intercom along with some music.
She exchanged pleasantries with the family of the patient that was staying in the same room as her.
 Probably eager for his mother to be discharged, their small child was wearing a beaming smile.
That child's mother was pregnant in the bed next to mine with what may be their new brother or sister.
They were probably ready to burst with the expectations, dreams, and worries of having a new sibling.
The joys of a growing family.
...Bathing in those warm feelings, I stroked my own belly, which had grown quite large.
I had talked with him about how many children we wanted to have.
We talked about how if we had three, it would certainly be lively.
...However, there was the inescapable worry of whether I would be able to handle giving birth that many times.

<Yukie>
"There isn't a mother out there who would hate to give birth because of that worry, though..."
Yukie, smiling as she said that to herself, gently stroked her stomach.
The Metropolitan Public Safety Division.
The place where that man's sense of justice had lead him.
...That person was actually a very gentle, very fragile person.
He didn't talk much about the specifics, but I didn't think he was suited for the assignment he was on right now.
But... as long as he said he was going to try his best, I would watch over him warmly.

<Yukie>
"Your father, you see... is a very hard worker, you know?
 Coochie coochie coo...☆."
Yukie seemed to be enjoying herself as she talked to her own belly.
...At that moment, Yukie suddenly became concerned about something, and looked out the window.
It used to be this time...
Long ago.
 She remembered that when she was little, around this time in the countryside where her grandmother lived, the higurashi would fill the air with their chorus.
This was the middle of Tokyo.
Unlike in the countryside, you couldn't hear the song of the higurashi.
...But for some reason... at that moment Yukie felt that she wanted to hear that song.



[Himatsubushi tip - 12]
There was something I didn't like about my child.
I first realized it when I started writing these things down.
They never warn you about it in any books about raising children, but they aren't just a plaything.
If they aren't able to feel loved even when they're not doing exactly as their parents want them to, then those parents are failures.
This wasn't something like that, though.
How can I say it...
 It's probably harder to express with mere words.
I just want my child to be average.
As long as they weren't falling behind, there wasn't any need for them to excel at something.
 As long as they acted appropriately for their age, I would have been fine with it.
But my child had been different ever since kindergarten.
While the children in her class were running around in excitement about the field trip the next day, she only wore a bored look on her face, aloof and distant.
When the other kids broke the equipment for the athletics festival and were apologizing fervently, she only wore a bored look on her face, aloof and distant.
When the teacher was reading a fun picture book, only she wasn't smiling.
Even if they all got to eat a delicious bento, only she wasn't happy.
...If it was only this, it would still be in the realm of understanding.
However, what I don't understand about my child is that if the aforementioned situations happened again, they'd now act in a manner befitting their age.
I don't understand the principle behind that, as a parent.
Why were they indifferent about that field trip, but happy about this one?
Why were they indifferent about that picture book, but happy about this one?
Why were they indifferent about that bento, but happy about this one?
The former and the latter in each situation seem exactly the same to me.
...There was even times when I thought the former one was better.
I don't understand that child's feelings.
During parent-teacher meetings, the teacher always says the same thing.
And I would always respond that I don't understand my own child, and we would mope together.
My husband, always the optimist, once said that a young child's feelings are different from an adult's, so if there were some things we didn't understand, we shouldn't worry about it.
 I lament his lack of urgency.
One day, when I was in a good mood.
I took the effort to prepare a menu that my child would enjoy.
...But she only smiled with a vague expression of disinterest.
That attitude frankly made me angry, so I hit her on the head.
On a day when the weather was nice.
The laundry I had just hung up to dry was blown by a large gust of wind, causing the entire line to fall down.
...But she, watching me trying to pick up the laundry in a panic, stood there laughing.
That attitude frankly made me angry, so I hit her on the head.
I think the same sort of thing happened countless times.
Before I knew it, my child was only able to look at me with an indifferent expression on her face.
...I regret the fact that I've been a bad mother.
Thinking I should regain her trust, I thought to get it back little by little with some light interactions.
Seeing her do some sort of craftwork on the veranda, I called out to her.

<Rika's mom>
"These past few days have been nice and sunny. The air feels nice, doesn't it?"

<Rika>
"......"
That child, with that indifferent look on her face I hated so much, looked up at me for a moment, then without a word returned to immersing herself in her craftwork.
...Up until now, I would have hit her on the head just for that.
 ...I held myself back.

<Rika's mom>
"What are you making?
 Is it a doll?"

<Rika>
"......A weather charm."
That child was using inserts from the newspaper to deftly make some weather charms.
The forecast hadn't called for rain.
But that child, in her own way, was praying that these sunny days would continue.
Being able to understand my own child for the first time in a while, I couldn't hide my own happiness.
Bringing out a ball of yarn, I began to hang my child's cute weather charms from the eaves of the house.

<Rika's mom>
"Ahahaha...
 It's no good, Rika.
 The heads are too heavy, see?
 They've become reverse weather charms now.
 If they're like this, they'll call the rain instead of the sun."
When I started to take them down, my child tugged at the hem of my shirt as if to stop me.

<Rika>
"......That's because I made them to be upside-down. They're fine."

<Rika's mom>
"...But, Rika.
 If they're upside-down, they won't be a charm that calls for a sunny day, you know?"

<Rika>
"I was making a charm for it to rain, so they're fine."
...I desperately suppressed the emotions welling up inside of me. I was trying desperately to understand my child.

<Rika's mom>
"Oh... I see...
 The morning glories in the garden were starting to get a little wilted from all the sun, so you wanted some rain, right?"
That child turned to me with the expression that I hated the most.

<Rika>
"I got bored... of the clear weather."
...I don't understand, I don't understand.
 ...I just can't understand that child...



[Himatsubushi tip - 13]
During the family council, she buried herself under Oryou-san's futon again.
...Oryou-san dotes on her unwaveringly.
No matter whatever insolence my child commits, she doesn't mind.
It's almost as though my child is a kitten or something.
 ...Oryou dotes on her exactly like you would with a kitten.
As her mother, I chided her for doing that.
Until Oryou-san had said three times that it was fine, I chided her as a formality.
Of course she never lends an ear to any of my chidings.
...Knowing that Oryou-san's standing was far above mine, she behaves like that.
I don't like the cunning that's unbefitting of her age either.
In any case, not only Oryou-san, but the rest of the old folk in the village spoil her too much.
One day, I was surprised.
By chance, on the way back from some shopping, I saw her by herself just outside a candy shop.
My own child suddenly grabbed a snack, opened the package right there and then started eating it.
She didn't make any attempt to pay for it, and she didn't even think of looking around.
It didn't even feel like she was shoplifting... more like she were brazenly eating snacks that was offered to her.
When I began to admonish my child, the elderly shop owner appeared and covered for her.
The owner gave the ridiculous excuse that he had said it was okay for that child to eat any of the snacks out by the entrance, so it was fine.
When I tried to pay for the snacks that my child had eaten, the owner refused my money.
During that exchange, more old folks had suddenly gathered around, and it began to feel like I was the one in the wrong.
The elderly people all put their hands together reverently in front of my child and repeatedly voiced their respects.
...I was born into the Furude family, so it wasn't like I didn't know why she was being treated specially.
When I was still young.
 It was something I heard often from my grandmother.
If by chance the child that I gave birth to was a girl...
That child would be the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama.
All the older folk believe she's the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama, and spoil her rotten.
And not only did they spoil her... but they even told her she was the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama,
 that she had a divine power, and threw all sorts of strange folktales her way.
So she may have begun to believe herself that she was a special existence.
I went around and told everybody that it wasn't good for her upbringing, so to stop telling her all these strange things... but there was no uprooting the elderly people's deep-seated superstitions.
I told my child not to listen to them, but it ended up being that she stopped listening to me.
Between all the old folks in the village who would dote on her and myself who only scolded her, there was no wonder who she would listen to.
...There was no mistaking that the reason she had become strange was because of the elderly villagers.
There was no doubt that they had shoved her full of strange folk tales and superstitions since she was young.
If it wasn't for that, there was no doubt my child would have been cute and normal!



[Himatsubushi tip - 14]
One sunny Parent-Teacher Day.
There was a cooking class, and my child was making curry rice with a practiced hand.
While the other children her age were awkwardly using their kitchen knives, that child was wielding hers deftly.
The teacher approached me with a smile on their face, saying it must be a result of learning it at home.
I managed to play it off with a vague smile and a nod in response.
...That was because I had never once taught my child how to make curry rice.
Even then, she was peeling vegetables with a practiced hand, adding them into the pot in the order of which took longer to cook.
For a normal parent, they might unintentionally clap their hands together, happy at their child's actions.
But in my case, it was different.
...There was no mistaking that somebody had taught her how to make that curry rice when I wasn't taking care of her.
...Thinking that, I quietly fell into an unpleasant mood.
When I asked, it seemed she could also sew and do the laundry.
I had never taught her how to do those, and again, never saw her do it around the house.
Be it cooking or sewing or the laundry.
...Again, that was probably because the elderly villagers taught her all sorts of rubbish when I wasn't looking.
And not only that, they probably taught her all sorts of strange superstitions, trying to prop her up as the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama.
I said as much to my husband, suggesting that we should keep our child away from the elderly folk.
But my husband, who was in the position of being the head priest of the Furude Shrine, had little power against the elderly who supported it.
...He took the rather uncommitted stance of saying that as long as she was being doted upon, wasn't it fine?
I argued against that.
That she was our child, and should be a completely normal girl.
That what the elderly were expecting, that she was the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama, was simply odd.
The elderly villagers believe that child has divine powers.
We would discuss the weather for the following day, but there were many times when I left the house without an umbrella and came back soaking wet.
Rather than having clairvoyance, that was just second-hand knowledge from her watching the news all the time.
The things that she knew that she shouldn't have known were just a result of the people who were trying to indoctrinate her and the people who were gossiping getting together in the village.
However... there certainly were days when everybody thought it was going to be sunny all day, and that child would stubbornly not go out without an umbrella.
It would occasionally rain, and in the end, we would be saved.
...There might also have been times where Rika knew of major accidents in foreign countries faster than the news did.
I thought that she must have heard it break over the radio or something.
...Knowing things she shouldn't have,
 something like that...
 Was in front of me right now, wasn't it?
That child was making curry rice when there shouldn't have been anybody who taught her how to.
No, no... that couldn't possibly be the case.
Somebody had taught her, indoctrinated her.
When I wasn't taking care of her, somebody had indoctrinated Rika with something.

<Chie>
"Furude-san's curry is absolutely splendid.
 I'll give it a gold star!"

<Rika>
"......Nipah~☆."

<Chie>
"Where did you learn to cook, Furude-san?
 At home?"

<Rika>
"......Yes.
 At home."
The other parents in attendance were impressed.
Lies, all lies.
 ...I didn't teach her anything.
Who was it? Who was it?
 Who was the person who had completely indoctrinated my child?
She was my normal, average daughter, not the living incarnation of Oyashiro-sama!
