[Watanagashi Ch.1]

The chirping of birds served as my alarm clock.
...Huh?
...Wasn't today Sunday?
Wasn't it basically my style to stay up late on Saturday and sleep through the morning on Sunday?
...Why was I waking up at this disgustingly wholesome hour?
 ...Back to sleep, back to sleep...

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi~, are you awake~!?
 You have a phone call!"
At that moment, the sound of my mother calling me from downstairs finally registered.
Phone call!?
I sprang up out of bed abruptly and stampeded noisily down the stairs.
"He's awake, I'll put him on right now," my mother informed the person on the other end of the line.

<Keiichi>
"Hello?
 It's me.
 Who might this be~?"

<Rena>
"Ahahahah!
 Mornin', Keiichi-kun.
 You're such a sleepy-head. Such a sleepy-head!"

<Keiichi>
"Oh, Rena! What's up, calling so early in the morning...?"

<Rena>
"Ah, I don't think it's so early... it's the middle of the day, you know?"
It was 11 o'clock.
...I guess you could loosely consider that 'the middle of the day.'

<Keiichi>
"So, what's up?"

<Rena>
"Hold on a second!
 I'll put Mii-chan on now."

<Mion>
"Ohayou, Kei-cha~n!
 If I were to say it in English, that'd be 'good morning.'"

<Keiichi>
"While we're at it, why don't you try saying it in Chinese, German, and Russian as well?"

<Mion>
"Ni hao Kei-chan.
 Guten Morgen Kei-chan.
 Russian!?
 Dasvidaniya...
 .........
 How the hell should I know!?!?"

<Keiichi>
"Wahahaha!
 Well, whatever.
 This stupid conversation has woken me up."

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!
 That's good to hear.
 ...So, Kei-chan, you free right now?
 If you're good, then we've got everybody."
Everybody?
 Did she mean all the club members?

<Mion>
"That's right.
 You might be thinking: 'Every day always ends in heated competition, but at least I can spend my day off peacefully'...
 You're too naive, Kei-chan!!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, yeah.
 The aim of our club is to find the best solution for every situation.
 In other words, we don't care if it's the weekend."

<Mion>
"Oooh!
 It looks like Kei-chan has come to understand our club!
 So, how about it? Can you come?"
I had absolutely nothing planned that day.
If I were to refuse Club President Mion's invitation, what other fun ways to pass the time would I have?

<Keiichi>
"...It's not like I planned on doing anything.
 And if I said no, you'd probably just declare me the loser by default and force a penalty game on me anyways!"

<Mion>
"If you understand that much, then you can't refuse, right~?
 If you're okay with it, then meet at the usual place at one o'clock!
 We're going into town, so bring your bike, okay?"
Club activities in town?
...Well, we could do them anywhere.
Besides, since it was a new venue, there was no way this wasn't going to be intense!

<Mion>
"I'm holding a pretty big grudge from that narrow loss a couple days ago!!
 I'll say it right now, I'm not going to lose!"
A couple of days ago was Friday's club activities...
 That uncompromising poker match!
It was a fight to the death.
Nobody held back.
Nobody could tell who was in the lead or who was last until all the points were tallied.
In the end, I won by only 1 chip.
Mion came in second.
"Dammit!!
 To think, if I hadn't squandered that one chip!!!"
Mion lamented thus, perhaps moreso that than the fact she lost the match.
Mion doesn't lose.
That's why Mion only whined when she let the champion's throne slip through her fingers.
That's why she was more frustrated than anybody over a close loss.
...So, did she mean for today to be a grudge match?!

<Keiichi>
"Bring it on!!
 Just like last time, I'll shut you down and make you play that penalty game!
 Make sure you play in a way that you won't regret it when you lose!!"

<Mion>
"Hehehe!
 Wouldn't have it any other way!
 It'll make it all the more better when I crush you!!!"
After that, we exchanged jeers for a bit before hanging up the phone.
As I headed back upstairs hastily to get the key to my bike, I bumped into my mother as she was carrying a futon down.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Oh, Keiichi, you seem like you're in a good mood. Heading out?"

<Keiichi>
"Something like that!
 I'm going into town to play with everybody."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Take care.
 Watch out for traffic~!
 Be back before dinner~!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, yeah! I'll be back by then!"
After unlocking the chain from my bike in the garage, I reveled a bit in the resistance the slightly stiff pedal gave as I pushed on it.
Alright, let's go!
I set off on my bike, cutting through the refreshing morning air.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-ku~n!
 You're late, you're late!"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, sorry to keep you waiting!
 Huh? Where are Satoko and Rika-chan?"

<Mion>
"Rather than meeting up with them here, it's a lot quicker to just meet up in town."
Oh, I see.
 If I remember correctly, Satoko and Rika-chan's houses were on the other side past the school.

<Keiichi>
"Oh yeah. What's up with doing club activities in town?
 It can't be that everybody's going to put on masks and rob banks all day, is it?"

<Mion>
"I wouldn't mind doing that.
 Even then, I wouldn't lose to you~!"

<Rena>
"You see, Mii-chan always tells me the routes and schedules of the armored bank cars.
 ...I wonder why? I wonder why!"
What?!
I spun around with a serious look on my face and looked at Mion.
 ...Well, it certainly seemed possible that Mion was capable of doing that.

<Keiichi>
"...Seriously Mion?"

<Mion>
"Re... RenaaaAAaaa!!
 What are you sayiiiiiinng!!!!"

<Rena>
"Ahahahahaha!
 Sorry, Mii-chan! Sorry! Ahahahaha!"
The two of them joked around.
...That bright laughter was the best match for a beautiful day like today.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, you two!
 Satoko and Rika-chan are waiting for us, aren't they?
 Let's stop fooling around and get going!"
Around and around, fooling about like two fluttering butterflies... I earnestly wished I could just keep watching them like this.
But, the five of us together would be absolutely more fun!

<Mion>
"That's right! Well then, let's go!"

<Keiichi>
"The goal is to plunder one billion!
 Once we split the loot, everybody scram!!!"

<Mion>
""Yeaaaaah!!""
The three of us on our bikes headed over the gently sloping hill towards town.
Accelerating hard, we crested the hill.
The view expanded as Okinomiya Station came into sight.
I occasionally come to the station here.
Considering the amount of effort it takes to get here though, it was quite a hassle.
That's why I didn't know much about the area around the station, or Okinomiya itself for that matter.
The street we were headed down today was of course unfamiliar to me as well.
Going through the railway crossing, we headed past the south end of the station.

<Keiichi>
"...This is the first time I've been this way."

<Rena>
"Around here, there's lots of things like arcades and toy stores.
 Mii-chan knows a lot about it!"

<Keiichi>
"So there's an arcade.
 I used to go to one pretty often!
 My gamer's blood roils within me!"

<Mion>
"Always going to an arcade? Kei-chan, you're quite the delinquent~!
 Next time we're here, I'll show you where it is.
 It's a good one—there's quite a few machines."
It seemed like the town of Okinomiya was Mion's stomping grounds.
If I asked her, she could tell me a lot of things about it.
Eventually, we came across a store with quite a few bikes parked in front of it.
Was this the arcade?
 No... it was a smaller shop.
Looking at the window display, it seemed like your everyday toy shop.
...But, for almost ten kids to be filing in and out of the store... they were doing almost too well for themselves!

<Keiichi>
"Could it be... that store is having some sort of event today?"

<Mion>
"Exactly!
 Top prize is 50,000 yen!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Fi-Fifty thousand!?!?
 What the heck is that!!
 That's the GNP of the People's Republic of Keiichi 5 times over!!!"
Two cute figures messing about the front of the store noticed us and waved their hands.

<Satoko>
"Hello, everybody~!!
 We've been waiting for you~!!"

<Rika>
"...Good morning."

<Keiichi>
"Hey!
 Morning, Rika-chan!
 Satoko, we'll settle this before the cops get here!
 The goal is to plunder 1 billion!!"

<Satoko>
"Huh?? ...Keiichi-san, I have no idea what you're talking about."

<Rena>
"Are we late? Did we keep you two waiting?"

<Rika>
"...We finished early today, so we've been waiting a while."

<Mion>
"I'm sorry about that.
 Kei-chan here was taking his sweet time!"

<Rika>
"...Well if it was Keiichi's fault, it couldn't be helped."
Saying that, Rika-chan stretched up and began patting Mion's head. Hey, wait a minute...
 ...Are you solving everything by making me the bad guy?!

<Satoko>
"Of course!
 Who else but Keiichi-san could fill this important role?
 Ooohoho!"

<Keiichi>
"I don't like being cast like that.
 If you think that this'll solve everything, you're sorely mistaken!"
...I was feeling slightly irritated, so I began to repeatedly smack Satoko on the head.
*smack smack smack smack smack smack...!!!*

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san hit meeeeeEEeee!!!
 WaaaaaaAAaaaAAAaaa!!!"

<Rika>
"...It's such a shame that Keiichi's bullying you."

<Rena>
"Satoko's crying! She's crying!!
 I'm taking her hoooome~~!!!
 Your big sis here will take care of the bad guy, okay?"
WHAAAAAAAAAAM!!!!
Rena ecstatically wiped the tears (which were probably fake...) from Satoko's face, while Rika-chan gently patted mine as I lay sprawled on the ground.
...Yes, this is fine.

<Keiichi>
"Hmmm, yup.
 ...This is the way things are supposed to be solved..."

<Mion>
"...Although, I think we should find a new punchline before you start losing teeth."
Well then, upsy-daisy.
In any case, the greeting for today went well!
Inside the toy shop, there were about 10 boys around the same age as me.
Apparently they all knew Mion, and finding out that she had arrived, they greeted her with jeers a few at a time.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan is a regular at this toy shop.
 So she has a lot of friends!"

<Keiichi>
"A regular at a toy shop... what's up with that?"

<Satoko>
"Hey, Keiichi-san, take a look back here!"
Following Satoko's prompting I took a look... there were chairs lined up at tables, almost like some sort of birthday party.
...I realized it immediately.

<Keiichi>
"I-It couldn't be... this is the venue for today's club activities!?"

<Mion>
"Surprised, Kei-chan?
 I'm good friends with the owner here!
 He sometimes lets me hold game tournaments to expand his customer base."
Expand his customer base... I see.
 ...Meaning, all the boys livening up the place... were participants!?

<Rena>
"That's right.
 Normally it's just us five, but today we're gonna play with lots and lots of people!"
Rena was innocently happy about being able to play with so many people, but my expression grew noticeably stern.

<Satoko>
"...Keiichi-san, I know exactly what you're thinking."

<Keiichi>
"Oh?
 Well then why don't you try saying it?
 Together, okay? One, two..."
"These are all enemies!!"
 Satoko's voice and mine blended together in harmony.
We looked over at the participants.
...After all, the top prize was 50,000 yen!
 My eyes lit up like a flame.

<Mion>
"Hey, Kei-chan.
 It looks like today will be fun."

<Keiichi>
"...Well.
 No matter how many more rivals I have, the goal is still the same!!"

<Mion>
"Rivals?
 ...*sigh*, Kei-chan.
 ...Do you think a whale keeps track of all the krill it eats~?"
She said that in an unpleasant voice, laughing with the aggressive glint in her eyes reserved solely for club activities.
...Dammit, Mion...
...She's as serious as she can get today!!

<Mion>
"I'm not the only one who's serious.
 ...Take a look at Rika-chan."
Mion pointed.
Looking at where her finger directed me...

<Keiichi>
"...What the heck is that?"
Rika-chan was using 'those kinds of traits' to soften up the group with an almost excessive pleasantness...!

<Rika>
"...I'm also going to do my best.
 Go for it, yaaay♪"

<Gallery>
"""Go for it, yaaaaay♪"""
Completely emasculated, the group joined Rika-chan in a cheer.
The inside of the store had been consumed by "The World of Rika-chan"!!
...Damn. ...She's already chomping at the bit!

<Rena>
"I-It seems like today's going to be fun!
 I'm going to do my best~!
 Hau~~~~!!"
It seemed that Rena was also unusually fired up by the large crowd.
Hopping about and running around, she had entered entirely into Kyute Mode.
..In Rena's case, the real fun starts when her Tension Gauge fills up!
Her happy-go-lucky attitude belied the fact that this was the state in which she was the most threatening...
Mion was making small-talk with some of the regular customers she was acquainted with. It was like business as usual with her.
Of course, if anybody thought that Mion looked ordinary, they were not qualified to be in our club.
The shadow beneath her feet was exuding killer instinct, rising up like a chill wind!

<Keiichi>
"...Damn it, Mion... throwing away her honor and humanity like that... she's serious."

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san, didn't you know...?
 ...The 50,000 yen prize is from Mion-san's own pockets."
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!?!?!?
She was putting out the 50,000 yen... all by herseeeelf?!
At that moment, a dark miasma that warped Mion's surroundings began to appear!!

<Mion>
"...Hm?
 What is it, Kei-chan?
 Is there...
 something on my face...?
 Hehehe!!"
Eep!! ...A shiver crept up my spine.
...That Mion... cornering herself like that... she was pulling out the demon lurking within her!!!
F-Fine with me..!
 Damn it... my knees are shaking like crazy...!
Before I realized it, the store had filled up with even more people.
However, the looks in their eyes weren't confrontational.
They were looks of expectation and curiosity.
They were the eyes of onlookers who were wondering what kind of match was going to occur, and who was going to win.

<Keiichi>
"Hehe... you couldn't ask for a better stage than this.
 This is getting interesting..."

<Rena>
"K-K-Keiichi-kun!
 L-L-L-Let's do our best, okay?
 Do our best!!
 Hau~!!!"
Rena was already fully charged.
Mortal laws and common sense held no power before the might of Rena in her Kyute Mode!
I definitely didn't want to fight her, if possible.

<Gallery>
"""Rika-chan, do your best!!
 We're all cheering you on~~!!!"""

<Rika>
"......Okay.
 I'll do my best~♪."
Rika-chan, who was exuding way too much charm no matter how you looked at it, had already won over most of the onlookers to her side.
Nonchalantly avoiding things had always been Rika-chan's creed, but... for her to be blatantly laying out her machinations like this, something was definitely strange!!
...Like Rena, she was somebody who I didn't want to fight if I could help it.

<Satoko>
"Of course, the one you don't want to fight the most is Mion-san."

<Keiichi>
"...I've been lucky to even leave alive more than a few times at the end of club activities, but...
 I don't think there was a day that even came close to being this dangerous."

<Satoko>
"Mion-san seems to have developed quite the grudge after losing that poker match a few days back, you know?"

<Keiichi>
"It seems that way.
 ...In other words, today is just an elaborate stage for her revenge!"
Almost as though she were psychic, Mion turned towards us.
Her eyes silently conveyed the message: "You guys just figured that out now?!"
It wasn't just Mion; both Rena and Rika-chan were more pumped up than they'd ever been.
...Yeah.
 ...One's gonna pop up today.
 ...Without a doubt, there'll be casualties!!

<Satoko>
"It seems that somehow Keiichi-san and I are the only ones left.

<Satoko>
...What do you think?
 Should we not have our match during the opening round?"

<Keiichi>
"Might as well.
 I need to warm up before I can really kick it into gear—"
My spinal column shuddered like it had been struck by a bolt of lightning, and like a pillar of ice was being jammed into it, began to freeze.
I could almost see the flames backlighting Satoko with their intensity.
Even then... while Satoko was displaying a normal smile...
 It was cold and inhuman, almost as if it were a plastic mask!

<Keiichi>
"...Heh!
 You must really want to eliminate me in the opening round.
 You can't hide that murderous intent."

<Satoko>
"Oh, that's too bad...
 You're being uncharacteristically cautious today, Keiichi-san.
 Ohoho!"
Without a doubt, it was a trap.
...I don't know what she had up her sleeve, but if I fought with Satoko during the opening round, my loss would be more certain than if I went against Mion!!!
A pitch-black miasma permeated the inside of the store...
Did they all want to win that 50,000 yen prize that much?!
No, that's not right.
...The only ones competing for the prize money were the casual participants.
I was different.
I had mistaken this as just a way to fool around on a normal Sunday.
It didn't matter when it was, or where it was, or who our opponents were.
...In our club, the goal is always the very top of the mountain!!!
An intense flame that no strong winds could extinguish, hot enough to melt any steel, began to burn inside me...
The fuse had been lit on this unprecedentedly intense club battle!!

It was then that the owner of the store told Mion in a lackadaisical voice that it was about time to begin.

<Mion>
"Is everybody ready~?!
 Listen close now~!!"
Mion began with the formalities, standing in for the owner, and explained the rules of today's tournament.
You're only playing to win!
There is no second or third place.
 ...That's the same rule as our club.
There were 15 people participating.
 We were to split up into 5 groups via a draw, and each group would have one winner.
Each winner in the first stage would advance to the next in order to compete in the final.

<Mion>
"Now, as for how each group will compete:
 each table can decide to play whatever they want.
 As long as the game is here in the shop, anything goes!"
Already in Club Mode Defcon 1, I didn't let the small gap in the rules go unnoticed.

<Keiichi>
"Mion, can I ask a question?
 Won't everybody push to play a game they're good at, and not be able to agree on which one?"

<Rena>
"...Hau.
 That's right.
 If we can't decide, we can't start."
The spectators also nodded along.
It was only natural.
 There wasn't anybody who would simply cede to their opponent's suggestion!

<Mion>
"I'd prefer if you were all good sports and manage to come to a decision on your own, but if it comes to a stalemate, should we have the store's owner decide for you?"
It was an event at a toy store, after all.
 You'd expect the owner to referee.
After that, Mion's rundown continued. It ended with the rule that any losing participants would have to buy the game they lost at; a rather nice proposition for the store.
First... we used a draw to split into 5 groups.
Everybody lined up single file, and began to draw tickets that the shop owner had prepared.
It was my turn.
Alright, time to draw.
 ...No matter who I was up against... I'd crush 'em!!!
At that moment, Mion began to laugh with a hawkish gleam in her eye.

<Mion>
"Of course, I'm sure you already know... but club members will have a separate penalty game than the casual participants."

<Keiichi>
"...Heh.
 I thought as much.
 What's the gist of it?"

<Mion>
"The winner gets to give the losers one order each."
Contrary to how simple it sounded...
 It was a terrifying eventuality, the subject of which no one could predict...
Damn you, Mion...
 Was she... really planning on parading me around Hinamizawa in cat ears and a banana hammock with a tail attached or something?!
The look on Mion's face told me... she wasn't going to let me off that easy.
On top of that... this time, it wasn't just the person who finished last who'd have to submit to the penalty game.

<Keiichi>
"The losers get one order each... in other words, even if you don't finish last, you still have to do a penalty game."

<Mion>
"That'd be the case."

<Keiichi>
"What about if there's no winner?
 Like, if all the club members drop out midway through?"

<Mion>
"...Ahahahaha!!
 Kei-chan, are you all right in the head~?"

<Keiichi>
"Wh-whaaaaAAt?!"
The look in Mion's eye became that of a lion baring its fangs!

<Mion>
"How, exactly, are the elite members of our club going to lose to some mewling newborns?
 ...Kei-chan.
 Don't embarrass me by getting eliminated in the first round."
Even so, I didn't feel threatened!!
 The more into it my opponent was... the stronger I would become!!

<Keiichi>
"You just wait and see.
 I won't just sit here and be bullied by you, Mion. I'll show you!!!"

<Mion>
"We shall meet...
 In the finals!!!!!!"
The results of the draw were... enough to make you cry conspiracy.
All the members of the club were nicely divvied up amongst the 5 tables.
...How did this happen when the draw was that random?!
The thought that I was already caught in Mion's puppet-strings made me feel uneasy.
That was fine, though.
...I'll crush all your petty tricks!!
Now, where were my opponents?
Everybody was headed to the table corresponding to the number on their ticket.
The competition at my table was... these two, huh.
 They look younger than me.
 ......Huh?

<Keiichi>
"...Aren't you two classmates of mine?"

<Tomita>
"Oh, hi.
 I'm Tomita.
 This is Okamura."
Okamura-kun greeted me by nodding his head.
So my opening round was to be against my juniors from school.
...Just saying, but it seemed like a pretty easy match-up.
 Lucky!
 Time to destroy them without mercy!!!!

<Mion>
"Alright then, everybody!!
 Please decide on your games and start!"
With Mion's declaration, the inside of the store suddenly became lively.
Everybody was yelling their favorite games at each other, trying to gain an advantage before they started.
Even my two classmates, who seemed taciturn at first glance, began to fiercely insist on their own games as soon as the signal was given.
 Of course I would kick those suggestions aside!
There was absolutely no reason to pick a game your opponent was good at!

<Keiichi>
"Sorry, they're all games I don't know.
 Could you pick something a little more well-known?"
Of course, they didn't agree to the games I suggested either.
 I could only smirk bitterly.
Naturally, after 5 minutes, this table still couldn't agree on a game.
Obeying the rules, we asked the store owner to decide on a game.
Clearing his throat, the shop owner brought over a board game from the back of the store.
It was a game called "Billionaire."
...Quite the vintage we have here.
Come to think of it... if you lose, you have to buy this game.
...That damned shop owner, was he using this competition to get rid of all the games he couldn't sell?

<Keiichi>
"I know this one.
 You guys do too, right?
 Spin the wheel, and head to the goal.
 Whoever has the most money after we liquidate our assets is the winner."
The two nodded in agreement, and finally the game was underway.
At that time, I already had a feeling of impending crisis.
...I wouldn't realize why until the game progressed a bit.

<Keiichi>
"1, 2, 3, 4.
 Celebrate the birth of your child.
 Receive $5000 from everybody.
 ...Sorry!"
Okay! I've built a bit of a lead!!

<Tomita>
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
 Bonus.
 Receive $100,000 from the bank."
Wha?!
 The tables were turned in an instant?!

<Okamura>
"1, 2, 3.
 Proceed to the corporate ladder course."
Whoa, that's a good route!!!
...It seemed like only my piece was landing on the 'steady' spaces?!
I had doubts as to why Mion didn't bring out board games for club activities, but that reason was laid bare to me before my eyes.
That's right.
I had only realized it now.
...This game... was completely based on luck!!!

What could I possibly do to make sure I ended up in first place at the end!?!?
The ultimate outcome of this game... was decided in a place beyond human hands!!!
...How were the other club members doing? My eyes naturally wandered off to the other tables.
Mion's table was... what?
They weren't doing anything?
Had they still not decided on a game...?
This naive idea... existed to distract me from the most frightening possibility...
Mion was lounging about, leisurely holding some juice she bought from the vending machine outside in one hand.
When our eyes met she gave me a look of ease.
It couldn't be... she'd already finished?!?!
 What game was it?!
 That easily?!
It was probably too late to be concerned with that at this point.
Only 5 minutes since we started, and her two opponents were already beyond recourse.
 ...They were sitting there, slumped over in disappointment.
Muttering to themselves, trying to figure out where they went wrong... for that, they'd find no answer.
Was there any reason for their defeat other than 'they sat at the same table as Mion'?!
Then, what about Rena's table?!
 The spectators were causing quite a commotion!
It looked like their game was karuta.
 The shop owner was apparently the one reading out the cards.
Rena tended to dawdle along and space out a lot...
...Wouldn't she have a hard time with this game?

<Master>
"Then, I'll read it out~.
 ...'The dog gets tired on a walk'~."
BAAAAAAM!!!!

At the same instant the shop owner began sounding out the words, the card in question disappeared off the face of the table—no, the face of the Earth!!!
 ...Impossible! Where did it go?!
...It was against Rena's cheek.
 She was rubbing it there.

<Rena>
"Hau~~~~!
 Sho kyuuuute~~!!
 I'm taking it home~~~!!!"
Looking at the card Rena was rubbing against her cheek... it was some anime-themed version of karuta, with rather cute moe illustrations decorating the cards.
Basically, it was a picture of a pretty dog-girl with a slightly large chest, panting and half in tears as she was being pulled along on a chain.
...With those types of pictures, even I could play with godlike speed...
Of all people to play that game, it had to be Rena!!
 It was entirely possible that her fingertips were on the verge of breaking the sound barrier!!

<Mion>
"...It's over."
Mion smiled coolly. Seeing no further reason to keep watching, she turned back.

<Rena>
"Sho kyute sho kyute!!!
 Even if Rena wins, I'll still buy these cards~~!!!
 I~'m ta~king them ho~me~~~ hau~!!!!"
After that, the second the card started being read out,
 BAAAAAM!
 BAAAAAAAAAAAAM!!
 Such decisive sounds echoed...
Well then, how about Satoko... oh, she was playing a rather orthodox game.
 Concentration.
Judging from the distressed look on Satoko's face... it seemed that she was struggling somehow.
One of the main characteristics of Concentration is that the pace of the game speeds up as it goes on.
As the number of cards to memorize decreases, it becomes easier to match several pairs in a row.
It wouldn't be exaggeration to say that the first person to take over the flow of the match can run away as the winner.
The cards still in play had decreased.
...If you memorized the cards that had been turned over before, you should have a good chance to sweep the table at this point...
Satoko probably knew the positions of all the remaining cards.
 ...However, her turn came a little too late!
 If her opponent followed up... the match would be decided!!

<Young boy>
"Houjou... Sorry, but I'm also aiming for the prize money.
 Don't hate me for this!"
This guy... did he have the locations of the remaining cards memorized?!
He was completely certain of his victory.
 The tension on his face relaxed.

<Keiichi>
"Hmph.
 ...It's over."
I whispered that in a bored manner as I turned my attention back to my own game.
I spun the wheel.
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

<Young boy>
"Wh-Whaaat?!?!
 No way!!
 The ace of hearts should have been here!!"
There was a commotion at Satoko's table as the shout rang out.
The other two at my table turned around in surprise.
I didn't.
 After all, there really wasn't anything to be surprised about.
The onlookers were confounded, most of them certain that the ace of hearts should have been there.
"There's no way... I must be seeing things... It must have been because I was excited..."
 ...So assured in his victory, the distress over his defeat ran deep.
Hmph.
 ...That's how it is.
If his opponent wasn't Satoko, then the ace of hearts certainly would have been there.
What a fool.
...When you're up against Satoko, you can't let your guard down for a moment until the battle is over!!!

<Satoko>
"Hmm? Keiichi-san, you still haven't finished your match?
 You have no sense for these things."
With a refined tone of voice reserved for only winners, Satoko called out to me.
For the casual observer, it must have looked like she only eked out a victory.
From my point of view, however... she was only playing around.
The roles of winner and loser had already been decided. It was nothing more than child's play!
The laughable part about it was that her opponent didn't know his role had already been assigned.

<Keiichi>
"Nice work there.
 ...Setting up a farce of a trap with the ace of hearts."

<Satoko>
"My opponent only walked into one of my traps.
 Even then, one was more than enough."
Satoko was a trapper.
Her true talent was never having one misfire.
...Setting off only one trap was more than enough?
 ...Hmph!! Ain't that cool!!!
The fact that the other club members were winning one after another with their own brand of play only added to my impatience at my own lack of progress...
Oh right, how was Rika-chan doing?!
How was our club's sly little fox doing?
 ...
 What the heck is that?
Over in that corner, the mood at that table was decidedly different from the others.
The game at Rika-chan's table was... you know that battery-powered fishing game?
The one where the fish opened and closed their mouths as they rotated on the platform, and you used a magnetic fishing rod to pick them up? That old thing.
...It seemed they planned on competing by seeing who could catch the most fish, but...
...It had become an atmosphere you could hardly call competitive.

<Rika>
"....Wow♪ I caught one~."

<Man>
"You're so good!
 Rika-chan, you're good at this~!"

<Man>
 "Oh my, she caught another one~.
 Rika-chan is really good at this☆"
...I knew that Rika-chan had already charmed her opponents, along with the onlookers, before the matches had even begun, but...
 ...brilliantly played.
That corner had become an informal meeting of the Rika Furude Fan Club!!

<Rena>
"It's Rika-chan's total victory!
 Total victory!
 Rika-chan's good at fishing, isn't she~!"

<Keiichi>
"What Rika-chan is trolling for probably isn't fish..."
Hearing that, she glanced over my way briefly.
"This is my way of getting serious."
 ...That's what I heard.

<Satoko>
"This is a masterful technique that only Rika is allowed— only Rika can do!!"
...Yeah!
 ...A masterful technique!!!!

<Tomita>
"Maebara-san, it's your turn."

<Keiichi>
"Oh, sorry.
 Guess it is.
 1, 2.
 ...Fined for tax evasion.
 Pay $50,000 dollars..."
In contrast... my game... what an unseemly situation this was!!
Noticing the uneasiness creeping across my face, my companions came to see how I was doing.

<Rena>
"Huh... Keiichi-kun, could it be you're struggling? You're struggling?"

<Satoko>
"Okamura.
 Right now, how much money do you have?"
Okamura, who had wrung lots of money out of the elite course, began to count through a stack of white 100,000 dollar bills.

<Okamura>
"Uh...about 980,000, I guess."

<Rika>
"...How much money do you have, Tomita?"

<Tomita>
"Ah, I have... $880,000.
 I'm still close enough to turn this around!"
Those two, it looked like they would easily surpass a million dollars!!

<Mion>
"Well? Kei-chan, how much do you have...?"
Mion's tone of voice was grim from the get-go.
 ...It was her disappointment and disgust as club president.

<Keiichi>
"I... It can't be helped!!
 There's no strategy involved other than spinning the wheel in this game!!!

<Keiichi>
How am I supposed to cheat?
 Tell those two to close their eyes and count to a hundred while I rig the wheel?!
 ...You know there's no way I can do that!!"
Rika-chan gently pet my head.
 ...Still, she wasn't too happy.

<Satoko>
"...How pathetic.
 At one point I thought you'd be a worthy adversary.
 I've been utterly disillusioned."

<Rena>
"Don't give up, Keiichi-kun!
 There has to be some way to make a comeback!
 Do your best!
 Right 'till the end!!"
...Like I said... how am I supposed to make a comeback with this game relying entirely on luck!?!?
 Right?! Mion?!
...Mion's face, however, was almost unbelievably indifferent... like she was watching something completely unexciting.
...She then turned her back without saying a word.

<Keiichi>
"H-
 Hey, Mi—"
It was a pathetic voice that irked even myself...

<Mion>
"...I'm disappointed.
 Everybody was serious about this, but Kei-chan was the only one who wasn't."

<Keiichi>
"Wh-What do you mean by serious?!?!
 Are you telling me to control the spinner through sheer force of will?!?!
 How can I do that?!?!"

<Mion>
"...If you were serious about it, you would have settled this game 10 seconds from when you started."

<Rena>
"Mi-Mii-chan! You don't have to get so angry!
 Wait!"
Mion, in a bad mood, cast me aside and disappeared into the depths of the shop.
...Maybe it was because it had become an awkward situation, but the spectators dispersed from around my table...
Damn it!! Are you saying I'm not serious about this?!
Are you saying if I were serious, I would have settled this game of chance in 10 seconds?!?!
 If I were serious... If I were serious...!!!!
Everybody was praying for my victory.
 They believed in me!!
 ...Did I betray their expectations?!?!
Was it because... I wasn't serious?!
....Ugh...!!!!

<Okamura>
"Umm... should we continue the game...?"
The two of them were timidly trying to resume play.
...I didn't respond to that.
The table sunk into silence.

<Master>
"Maebara-kun... should I take that to mean you're giving up?"
The owner, thinking I was forfeiting, started to announce the cancellation of the game...
 At that moment!!!
...The demon inside me let loose a howl... and awakened.
I get it now, Mion...
...What it means for me to be serious...
 I'll show yoooooooooooooooooou!!!!
BAMPH!!
I clamped my hands on their shoulders, speaking in a low voice after pulling them closer.

<Keiichi>
"Tomita-kun.
 Okamura-kun.
 Let's make a deal.
 Let me win."
The two of them, not immediately understanding what I had just said or the meaning behind it, were momentarily confused.

<Okamura>
"Hey, Maebara-san, no violence!
 Let's settle this game properly!!"

<Keiichi>
"Just listen to what I have to say.
 ...What is it you guys want?
 The 50,000 yen prize?"

<Tomita>
"Well, of course.
 Winning that kind of money is a once in a lifetime opportunity!"

<Keiichi>
"Even supposing you win.
 What are you going to do with that money?
 How are you going to enjoy it?"
...The two of them considered it briefly.

<Okamura>
"Buy a new game, or something...?
 Snacks?
 ...Maybe some juice..."

<Keiichi>
"Hehehe... that's petty.
 So petty.
 Are you guys stupid? Hehehe!!!"

<Tomita>
"Th-Then, how will you enjoy it if you win, Maebara-san?"

<Keiichi>
"Me?
 That's the point.
 Just shut up and listen to what I have to say."
We club members have a penalty game separate from the casual participants.
If we lose, we have to obey a single command from the winner.
...From another point of view, the winner earns the prize of being able to order the other club members around!

<Keiichi>
"First of all, Tomita-kun.
 You like Satoko, right?
 Don't deny it!!!
 Next, Okamura-kun.
 You like Rika, right?
 Don't turn red!!!!"
I drew the two of them—red-faced and conscious of whether anybody else heard what I just said—even closer.

<Keiichi>
"Lolis!

 Moe!

 What men covet,
 what men dream about!!

 It's like an unreachable Garden of Eden!!

 Even then, you'd still aim for it, wouldn't you?!


<Keiichi>
That's because our passionate souls scream for moe!!!!"

That sensitive age where you couldn't say you liked the girl you liked...
 Understanding that gave me all the more power!!!

<Keiichi>
"Tomita-kun, if I win...
 I'll make Satoko wear a collar and be your little sister for a day."
*Pshh*. A red fountain spewed from both of Tomita-kun's nostrils.

<Keiichi>
"Also, Okamura-kun.
 I'll put cat ears on Rika-chan and let you take her out for a walk on a leash."
*Pshh*. Blood erupted from the vein in Okamura-kun's forehead.

<Okamura>
""Th-th-that... That... Uhhhhhhhhhh......!!!!!""

<Keiichi>
"Don't be shy!!!
 Just pretend I forced you to go along with me!!

<Keiichi>
You two are simply sacrifices to Maebara-senpai's whims!!
 You can pretend to be against it!!
 I understand!!! I know everything that your hearts desire!!!!"
...Then, I suddenly lowered the tone of my voice.

<Keiichi>
"...My school life was very bleak.
 I know with my very body how foolish it is to waste such an important time in your lives.

<Keiichi>
...So... to you, my juniors...
 I don't want you to live your lives like that!!!!!

<Keiichi>
Be honest with yourselves!!!
 Chase your dreams!!
 Fulfill them!!!
 I'll fulfill them for you!!!"

It was this moment that the values of men bridged generations.

<Okamura>
""Ma-Maebara-saaaaAAAaaaaaAAAaan!!!!!!""
Did I ever have a mentor who ever spoke my mind for me so strongly?
 Never!!
 There was no way there was!!!
That's because in a man's lifetime, he'll only have three fateful encounters.
 That valuable first time... was being experienced right this moment with these two!!!!

<Keiichi>
"It's fine then?
 Let's do it.
 ...One, two, three."

<Okamura>
"""Game oveeeer!"""

It was such an assertive declaration of the game's ending that everybody in the store turned and looked.
It had been less than 3 minutes since I was on the verge of forfeit and all the spectators were certain of my loss.

<Satoko>
"Ke-Keiichi-san... what happened!?
 Who won...?!"

<Keiichi>
"It was my complete victory."

<Satoko>
"Wh-What did you saaaaAY!?
 Exactly how did you overcome that situation?!"

<Keiichi>
"There's no need to explain what happened.
 It was a gentleman's agreement.
 Right, guys?"

<Okamura>
""YESSIR!!!!""
The two of them, stifling tears of gratitude, answered strongly from the bottom of their hearts.
Exactly what kind of miracle occurred here during those three minutes the spectators all looked away from my utter disadvantage?!?!

<Rena>
"Y-you did it! You did it, Keiichi-kun!! Yaaaaaay!!!"
The spectators were puzzled at how I was able to so quickly overcome that hopeless situation!
"...That guy, is he able to control the spinner wheel with his eyes or something?!"
"It's a miracle!"
"What devilry is this!!"
"He's in cahoots with *that* Mion, you know!?"
"There's no doubt he had some strange trick up his sleeve!!"
I looked at the crowd, who couldn't help but be excited, out of the corner of my eye. Now fully awakened and in battle mode, I let out a derisive laugh.

<Keiichi>
"...So this is what it means for me to be serious.
 Mion."

<Mion>
"Hmph.
 ...You took your sweet time."
Baring our fangs at each other, we laughed together in a most unsightly fashion!!

<Satoko>
"With this... all the club members have cleared the first round, then!!"

<Rena>
"Which means, this time... it's a match against everybody! A match!"

<Rika>
"...I've already decided what I'm going to buy with the prize money."

<Satoko>
"That's only natural~!
 Right~?"
Satoko and Rena smiled (sneered?) at each other.
Hmph, these guys...
Do they really think they can win against Keiichi Maebara when he gets serious?!?!

<Keiichi>
"Mion.
 ...That was a mistake.
 ...You shouldn't have offered me 'advice' just now..."

<Mion>
"...Hehehe... what a mewling newborn you are.
 You're a million light years too early to think you can win against me."

<Keiichi>
"Mion.
 ...Light years are a measure of distance."
...Oh, she's embarrassed, she's embarrassed.

<Rena>
"What are we doing, Mii-chan?
 How are the five of us going to face off?
 How?"

<Mion>
"Well now.
 ...Hehehe.
 We have such a splendid line-up.
 It would be a waste to rush things."

<Rika>
"...Mii is saying something complicated again."

<Keiichi>
"!? ...It couldn't be... why you—!!"
Mion's hair flowed elegantly—almost like a cape—as she turned her back to the table.

<Mion>
"As for today's contest: I, Club President Mion Sonozaki, will reserve judgment for now.
 The method and time are yet undecided.
 ...The more spectators, the better. 

<Mion>
It should be in front of everybody from Hinamizawa and Okinomiya.

<Mion>
...By then, we'll know the best way to finally settle things."

<Satoko>
"A-Are you running away from this!?!?
 This is too unfair, even for you, Mion-san!"

<Mion>
"Hehehe... you newborn!!
 Do you still not realize what has happened?"
The combative aura billowing out of Mion's body formed a barrier, stopping Satoko's advance!!

<Mion>
"We'll meet again.
 Prepare yourself for your inevitable defeat."
With a shrill laugh, Mion left the store...
After a moment of silence, the crowd erupted into cheers!!
"When will they resume the contest?!"
"Mion's serious!"
"The other members did great too!"
"That new guy, Maebara... He's got some strange power...!!!"
"He turned the tables in an instant!!"

<Okamura>
""Maebara-saaaaaan!!!
 You've got to win!!!""

<Keiichi>
"Yeah!!
 I'll dunk someone like Mion headfirst into the River Styx for ya!!!"
The part of the crowd that had apparently overheard the covenant between Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun, and myself erupted into a cheer again!!
Mion's going to win anyways!!
 She's the Undefeated Empress!
 I'm betting on Mion!!
No, it's going to be Rena with that ungodly speed!!
Satoko the Trap Artist!!
Rika the Siren!!
It may be a long shot, but it'll be Maebara!!!
However, right now, I had no ear for those cheerful voices.
Setting the stage for this huge match and then running away like that... I wasn't going to forgive Mion!!!
Outside of the store, Mion was getting on her bike as the shop owner was seeing her off.

<Keiichi>
"Don't run away, Mion!!
 If you're the club president, don't run!!
 Fight meee!!!"

<Mion>
"Oh, sorry, Kei-chan.
 Right now,
 I've got to get to my part-time job☆."
Huh!?
 Like you would see in a sketch-comedy show, my legs slipped in opposite directions until I was doing the splits.

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 While you were playing your game, Mii-chan received a phone call.
 ...It's too bad."

<Mion>
"It was just getting good, too... not our lucky day.
 ...They're getting crushed at the sale over at my Uncle's store. They don't have enough people to work the registers, so he called me for help."

<Keiichi>
"When you say your uncle... does he manage a supermarket or something?"

<Mion>
"It's just a small store,
 buuuut!

<Mion>
...Whenever you put stuff on special, all the housewives swarm in like locusts. Don't they have any common sense?! 

<Mion>
Even though they don't have enough staff, they're selling a carton of eggs for 10 yen, limit one per customer!!!"
I was a little surprised.
You would never think that this was the club president exuding such a dark aura inside the store just a short time ago.
It was the usual Mion right now, almost exasperatingly so.
My shoulders slumped.
...That's right.
 Club mode was over now...
But... It was really heated today.
 It really was fun!
Damn Mion, she really knows how to fire people up!

<Mion>
"Me too!
 I got so fired up my head started to tingle!
 Especially Kei-chan!
 That was scary!!
 I thought he was going to eat me alive there!"

<Rena>
"It's work, so I guess there's nothing you can do... but it really is too bad!"

<Satoko>
"I really want to continue this some other time!
 Any time is good~!"

<Rika>
"...How about we do it at the Watanagashi Festival?"

<Mion>
"The Cotton Drifting Five-Demon Fire Fight!
 ...That's right.
 I'll think about it."
Right now, what were Rika-chan and Mion talking about?
...Watanagashi Festival?
 Cotton Drifting Five Demon... what??

<Mion>
"Ahahahaha!
 I love it when things turn out all over-the-top and manga-like.
 It'd be nice if we could have another thrilling club activity like this soon!"
She laughed with a smile that made you feel refreshed just looking at it.
At that moment, the shop owner came out carrying a paper bag.
 ...I wonder what it is.
 Is he giving it to us?

<Master>
"Thank you, everybody, for today.
 Thanks to you, the event went really well~!
 It's not much, but here's a little something for you guys~."

<Mion>
"Hey, Uncle Yoshirou!
 Isn't there a little something for me, too?"

<Satoko>
"My my my!!
 Quite an adorable one, is it not!?"
When Satoko and Rika-chan opened up the bag, there were cute little stuffed animals inside.

<Rena>
"Wow!!
 They're so... kyute~...!!
 Can I take them home?!
 I really can...!?"

<Keiichi>
"Which means, there's something for me, too?
 ......Oh.
 I got a pretty adorable one."
It was a stuffed toy wearing a beautiful dress.  One you'd use to play house.
Rena's eyes were glued to my stuffed doll!
...Satoko was the same, and...
 Rika-chan too...!?

<Mion>
"Ahahahaha!
 Kei-chan got the one that fits him the least!"

<Keiichi>
"...How do I say this... I could say it's pretty or cute...
 ...Well, I guess it's cute and pretty... I can admit, it's adorable... but a doll with changeable clothes is... eh..."

<Mion>
"If you walked around with it, then you'd be treated like a weirdo starting tomorrow. Definitely!"
...Mion didn't have to go that far.
 This wasn't something a guy like me should be carrying around.
Mion was the only one who hadn't received a present, so I thought about giving it to her. However, after briefly considering, I gave it to Rena instead.

<Rena>
"Huh!?!?
 You're giving it to me!?
 To Rena!?
 Thank you~~~!!!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Just protecting myself.
 ...If I didn't give it to Rena, then walking the streets at night would be scary."

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!!
 No doubt! No doubt!"

<Keiichi>
"I thought about giving it to Mion, but it just didn't feel right!"

<Mion>
"Heh heh heh, you know it!
 I sometimes wonder why I wasn't born a boy."

<Keiichi>
"It's better that you're a girl.
 If you were a boy, I would have killed you already!"

<Mion>
"Ahahahahaha!!
 You should kill me while you still can!
 If you don't, Kei-chan, you might not live to regret it.
 Ahahahahaha!!"
Mion laughed after saying such an ominous line.
Everybody laughed heartily along with her.

<Keiichi>
"Ask God to make you a boy in your next life!
 I'll also have Him make me a boy."

<Mion>
"Then together, the two of us will start with taking over the country as a warm-up!
 Ahahahaha!"
"Mion-chan, if you don't get going soon..."
 the shop owner told her meekly.
The lot of us looked like we were having a lot of fun, so it must have been hard to put a wet blanket on things.

<Mion>
"Later then.
 Today was really fun.
 I'll see you later guys.
 Tomorrow, at school~!"

<Keiichi>
"Don't be late for work!"
Everybody waved their hands and watched as Mion left.
...Before I knew it, the sun was already setting, and the breeze carried a hint of chill.

<Rena>
"Should we play for a bit more in town?
 Or should we go home?"

<Rika>
"...The road gets scary when it's dark."

<Satoko>
"Then, I guess it's time to leave.
 We certainly caused a ruckus today!"

<Keiichi>
"We sure did! ...Okay!
 Let's go home."
The wind blew gently, as if to cool down those of us flushed with enthusiasm.
The road back to Hinamizawa was long, but I didn't really mind.

<Satoko>
"Oh, that's right!
 Rena-san, you achieved an overwhelming victory, didn't you?"

<Keiichi>
"When Rena gets like that, I'm sorry to say it, but there's no winning against her!"

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha!
 It was because the cards were so kyute.
 See!
 I bought them☆. Hau~~!"

<Satoko>
"Rika was the same as usual.
 When it comes to boys, it's like taking candy from a baby!"

<Rika>
"...It was an easy win."

<Keiichi>
"...How much was calculated and how much was natural...?
 I get scared when I think about how Rika will turn out in the future..."

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha!
 Satoko-chan was amazing too!
 The way it ended was really exciting!"

<Satoko>
"It wasn't the sort of game where I should be complimented.
 Ohohoho!"

<Rika>
"...Keiichi, you also showed your fangs at the end there."

<Keiichi>
"Hm?
 Well, I guess!
 I'm the type of guy who's strongest when he's cornered!"

<Satoko>
"...Tomita-san and the others seemed to be cheering you on really hard... what was that about?"

<Rika>
"...He made some sort of promise with Tomita and Okamura.
 ...It's probably a secret."

<Rena>
"A... a secret... a secret...
 ... Hau~~... I wonder what it is, I wonder!"

<Keiichi>
"....Ah, sometimes, for a man, there are times we can only understand one another by fighting...!
 Wahahahaha!!"
Desperately laughing, I frantically tried to avoid the subject.
After that, everybody continued to praise each other for how they defeated their opponents, and reflected on how fun today was.

<Satoko>
"Everybody look!!
 The sunset is beautiful~!!!"
Satoko, getting even more excited, pointed. Waiting where her finger indicated was an immense sunset, casting even longer shadows of us on our bikes.
The cries of the higurashi were gentle and very comforting...



[Watanagashi Ch.2]


<Mion>
"I wonder why afternoons always make you feel sleepy like this."
Mion spoke in a voice that went so far as to make whoever heard it lethargic.

<Keiichi>
"You want a medical explanation for sleepiness?
 I could say it, but it'll just make you more sleepy."

<Mion>
"...Gah~ ...Spare me~..."
It was almost 3 o'clock.
6th period was almost over.
By the way, Satoko and everyone else in the lower grades ended their school day after 5th period, so they were probably running around in the schoolyard right now.
I could hear their joy-filled voices coming from there right now. Oh, what I would give to be able to join them.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, you're the class representative, so you have to try harder.
 No going to sleep~."

<Mion>
"You see, rather than the class representative, I'd rather be the president of the boxing club.
 They get to sleep a lot."

<Keiichi>
"Huh? ...What makes you think that?"

<Mion>
"At the boxing gym they're always hitting the sack. Get it?"
BAM!
The teacher cackled as she hit the back of Mion's head with the corner of a textbook.

<Chie>
"...That's all from me.
 I'll leave it at that for today.
 Representative, please direct the class."

<Mion>
"Everybody stand up!
 At attention!!"
Mion, who had been half-asleep, became lively again the moment she heard class was over.
...It must be delightful to be that shrewd.
Homeroom was done after the lower grades had finished their lessons, so we were free to go.
It was one of the odd rules we had as a mixed-grade school.
When they knew class was over, Satoko and Rika-chan returned to the classroom.

<Rika>
"...Good work today."

<Satoko>
"All right!! It's time for happy fun club activities!!"

<Mion>
"Yeah!
 That's right.
 What should we do today?"

<Rena>
"Hey, Mii-chan.
 Why don't we continue what we started yesterday?"

<Satoko>
"Yes!
 We should do that!
 To have it end like that when things were getting good, I won't accept it!"

<Mion>
"Now now.
 I know how you feel, but let's save that for another time!
 Something like that shouldn't be done somewhere dinky like a classroom after school, but a grander stage!"

<Keiichi>
"I'm down whenever.
 But some of the younger guys said they'd watch me in the finals.
 So let me know ahead of time."

<Rena>
"Whoa!
 Keiichi-kun, you're amazing!
 There's people cheering you on! Cheering you on!
 ...I wonder if there's anybody cheering on Rena..."
I couldn't help but watch as Rena entered her Pining Maiden Mode.

<Keiichi>
"I'm not gonna pull any punches, but I'll pray for your victory, Rena."
With a saccharine Keiichi-brand smile, I ruffled Rena's hair roughly.

<Rena>
"Wha!?
 Hau~~~!?!?
 ...Ke-Ke-Ke-Ke...
 Keiichi-kun,
 what.. are you... hau~~..."
Rena turned bright red and short-circuited, smoke billowing from both her ears.
Gazing into her eyes, a strange scene of me holding hands with Rena and skipping through a flowerbed was reflected there...
...Ahh... even if it was in somebody else's imagination, it was terribly troubling...

<Rika>
"...Meet Keiichi, the Rena-killer."
When Rika-chan said that, everyone burst out laughing at once.

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!
 That Rena is a Satoko and Rika-chan killer, though!"

<Satoko>
"It may be true that we can't win against Rena... but we won't lose to Keiichi!!"

<Keiichi>
"Oh~ This is becoming a pretty interesting relationship map.
 Our strengths kind of interact like in rock-paper-scissors!
 ...But that doesn't include Mion, does it?"

<Mion>
"Of course not.
 It doesn't matter who it is, I won't lose."
Mion leered with the gaze befitting of a club president— no... befitting of an empress!
The mood in the room became more lively.
 It was as good a moment as any to get started!

<Mion>
"Well now!
 Let's get started nice and easy!"

<Rena>
"Yeah!
 So then Mii-chan, what shall we do today? Today?"
Mion let out a small interjection as she rummaged through the so-called "Club Locker."
Every time I look... there's always a ton of things crammed in there.
Everything that's jammed in that locker is a game of some kind, you know?
On top of that, things used for penalty games like cat-ears and collars were kept in there... the capacity of that thing is unfathomable!
...That locker, maybe it actually extended through the wall into the 4th dimension... that's my theory, anyways.
If not that, then how else could you explain how someone could pull out item after item!?
After Mion touched her hand to her chin briefly in thought, she turned around without pulling out any games.

<Mion>
"Why don't we try and keep it a bit simple today?
 Playing games that require lots of pieces all the time can be a little bland, right?"

<Rika>
"...It doesn't matter what game it is, if everybody plays together we can have fun."

<Rena>
"Yeah. That's right. That's right!"
Rena and I both expressed our agreement.
 ...I feel the same way.
With this group, there's no doubt even if we were pulling weeds from the school grounds it would be fun.

<Satoko>
"...That wouldn't be fun for me.
 Pulling weeds or whatever."

<Keiichi>
"Ah, that's right, isn't it?
 ...By the way, Satoko.
 Could you stop reading people's minds by looking at their expressions?"

<Rena>
"Whatever you're thinking is always written all over your face.
 So I always know right away~."
I've always been told that, but ever since I transferred it seems like it's been especially bad...
I need to develop a poker face or I could be in for a rough time...

<Mion>
"Alright! Everybody pay attention~!
 I'm going to explain the rules~!!"
We all immediately cut the idle chatter and put on stern expressions.
In no time at all, everybody's gaze focused like a tiger or a shark, listening intently.
That's right.
 From the point where the rules are explained... the match has already begun!

<Mion>
"Today's game is... probably better known as a party game.
 It's called 'Sympathy.' Has anybody heard of it before?"
...Sympathy.
It means to share someone's feelings, right?
 ...Huh? Maybe I might know this...

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, maybe it's...
 The game where we choose a topic, and everybody writes down the first word that comes to mind...
 And the more people who share the same answers, the more points are awarded? 

<Rena>
In that case, Rena knows about it!"
Ahh... I remember!
I recall playing a game like that in grade school while we were on the bus during a field trip!

<Satoko>
"I'm not familiar with this game.
 I would like an explanation."

<Mion>
"First of all, we have the leader choose a topic.
 For example... if they choose 'dessert.'"

<Mion>
"Hehehe!
 Satoko-chan, when somebody says 'dessert,' what's the first thing you think of?"

<Satoko>
"...Ummm.
 ...Let's see here...
 'Pudding' or something."

<Mion>
"Ok! In that case, Satoko, you would write down 'pudding' on your memo pad.
 Then, everybody reveals their answer at the same time.
 If there's two or more people who wrote down 'pudding,' they get points!

<Mion>
The more people who write down the same answer, the more points are awarded. So if everybody writes down the same answer, that's a max of 5 points!"

<Rika>
"...In other words, the trick is to think so that what you write down is the same answer as everybody else."
It was exactly as Rika-chan said.
The point of this game was to think in a way so that you have the same answer as everybody else.
For example... even if you heard the word 'dessert' and immediately thought of 'strawberry sundae'...
 ...If your answer doesn't match up with everybody else you don't get any points.
That's why you have to hold off on that answer, and change to one that seems like one everybody else will choose...
The key becomes not what you think yourself, but being able to predict what everybody else will answer. It's a very high-level intellectual game!!

<Rika>
"...Mii, for Satoko's sake, let's try practicing for one round."

<Mion>
"OK~. For this round, seeing as I'm club president, the leader will be me, alright?
 The topic can be something random..."
Taking out her literature textbook, she began flipping to a random page.

<Mion>
"Alright then... this is the only practice round!
 ...The first topic is...
 'Shaved Ice'!!!"

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!
 When you say 'shaved ice'... there's only one answer, isn't there~!"
Among the standard flavors of shaved ice, there's strawberry, melon, and Blue Hawaii.
The most popular amongst those... is obviously melon!

<Mion>
"Everyone wrote down an answer?
 Then everybody show theirs at the same time, okay?
 Ready... go!"

<Club Members>
"Strawberry." "Melon." "Ujigintoki." "Strawberry." "Strawberry."
Wha—!?!? I'm the only one.. with melon!?

<Keiichi>
"Y-You guys...!
 Don't go doing something so mundane as picking strawberry as the standard!

<Keiichi>
Hey Rena, would you actually order strawberry shaved ice!?
 The first thing that always sells out at summer festivals is always melon, isn't it!?!?"

<Rena>
"Rena also likes melon flavor!
 But really... it's all about the strawberry, right? Right☆!"

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, if I was to pick, I would actually choose melon.
 But you see, this is a word association game.
 If somebody says shaved ice the first thing you think of is strawberry!"
I'm still not entirely convinced... but in any case! It's this type of game!!

<Satoko>
"R-Rika, what exactly did you write?
 Is that a type of shaved ice??"

<Rika>
"...It's ujigintoki.
 It's incredibly delicious, you know."
Well, it might be delicious, sure... but it's not exactly run-of-the-mill.
 ..Still... that's a pretty refined choice...

<Mion>
"Satoko, did this help you get a good idea?
 There were 3 people who wrote down strawberry, so those people get 3 points!
 We compete to see who can get the most!"

<Satoko>
"Yeah, yeah!
 I've got it!!
 More importantly, Mion-san.
 What shall we do about today's penalty game!?"

<Rena>
"Hau...!
 Th-There's going to be one after all...
 ...What will it be? ...What will it be!"

<Mion>
"Hmmm...
 What should it be?
 ...Kei-chan, you have a suggestion?"

<Keiichi>
"Wha- for the penalty game??"

<Keiichi>
"...When I was in elementary school... there was a penalty game... yeah.
 It can only be 'that.'
 Schlepping!"

<Mion>
"In other words, that thing where the loser has to carry around everybody else's baggage.
 It happened often to the boys.
 Elementary school kids walking around completely covered in backpacks, you see it a lot~!"

<Rena>
"But... how will we do that?
 Satoko-chan and Rika-chan's houses are the complete opposite direction from ours."

<Mion>
"Then how about... the loser carries just the winner's stuff to their house?
 Getting everybody's stuff to their house would involve covering a pretty sizable distance."

<Rena>
"Oh, yeah.
 Just that much... might be alright!"

<Satoko>
"...Somehow, today's penalty game is pretty simple.
 With a penalty game of this level it wouldn't even be fun to make Keiichi-san do it!!"

<Mion>
"Then shall we raise the stakes a bit!
 Not just playing porter...
 ...
 Tadaa!
 How about we have someone schlep stuff around dressed in this!?"

<Keiichi>
"Wh-Wh—!!!

 Why a maid outfit of all things!?!?"

<Rena>
"H-Hau...!
 I-It's cute and all... b-but no waaaaaaaaaaaay~!!!!"

<Satoko>
"...But you see, you see!
 What do we do if Keiichi-san loses?
 If we don't have a size that fits him..."

<Mion>
"Oh I didn't let that little detail get by~!
 I have a nice XL size one prepared juuust for Kei-chan!!

<Mion>
So, Kei-chan, are you ready!?
 I'm going to have you walk around outside dressed up as a maid~!!!

<Mion>
From the headband to the finer details... I've got it aaaaall prepared for you!!"

<Keiichi>
"T-T-This is insane!! Why do you have every possible size of that type of thing in that locker!?"
Th-This is bad, Keiichi Maebara!!
Somehow... it's become a situation where only my failure results in an overly cruel price to pay.
What if I make a mistake and lose...!?
I wouldn't be able to walk around in broad daylight anymore!!
Oh, Ma'am, about that Maebara boy...
 Did you hear about him?
 It seems like he has a penchant for cross-dressing.
Oh my, really?
 That'd be so embarrassing, you know? Ooohohoho!!

<Keiichi>
"Ngyaaaa----!!!
 Th-That's way too harsh!!!!!"
That's just incredibly... brutal!!
 If we're to return this penalty to some semblance of normalcy, now is the only time!
E-Everybody, I think we should refrain from this unwholesome penalty game...!!!
Why on the way back home from school!?
 Do we have to be accompanied by a girl wearing a maid uniform and carrying our baggage!?
Having them say "Master,"
 while dragging them around the village in such an embarrassing outfit...
 ...*pant pant*
 ...Wait, why am I panting?
...Wh-What is this...
 This feeling welling up inside me...

<Rena>
"Hey, let's just make it a normal penalty game...!
 Wait, Keiichi-kun has frozen stiff..."
*FOOOOOM*!!!

Burning with passion, I firmly placed my hands on Rena's shoulders!!!

<Keiichi>
"Rena, there is no problem with the penalty game.
 ...I just have to win!!
 That's right, everybody!!!"
I turned to everybody with an idiotic grin, my pearly whites flashing with a brilliant gleam.

<Mion>
"Oh, Kei-chan, you've come around to the idea, eh?"

<Mion>
"No matter what the penalty game is, there's no reason to be afraid!!
 You just have to win!!
 Right, everybody!?
 Yeah! Yeah!"

<Rika>
"""Yeaaaaaaaaah—!!!"""
From Mion to Rika, everybody energetically thrust their fists up high!!
Only Rena seemed somewhat undecided, standing there looking flustered.
...She's a little bit slow, isn't she. If she wins, even for Rena it's quite a delectable opportunity!

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Rena.
 Don't you see this is a pretty big opportunity!?
 ...Rika-chan or Satoko-chan in a maid outfit, coming right to your doorstep. This is a historically great chance, isn't it!?"
*sploosh*
Rena began spouting a fountain of blood from her nose.
The look in her eyes completely changed... she's shifted into Kyute Mode!
I was waiting for this Rena!!
 That look in her eyes!!

<Rena>
"Hau~~~, to my doorstep~!!!
 It's not like Keiichi-kun or Mii-chan wouldn't be good too~! Hau!"

<Mion>
"Alright!!
 It looks like everybody's prepared themselves!!
 Get your memo pads ready!!
 First question, ready!?"
Mion opened up her textbook to a random page, and read out a word that caught her eye!

<Mion>
"The first topic is...
 'Summer Break'!!"
This is yet another... quite abstract keyword.
...Well then, let's not worry about it too much and start with something like this.

<Mion>
"Everybody good!?
 Time to show 'em!
 Ready, go!!!"
On Mion's signal, everybody simultaneously held up what they wrote.
Let's see, what did everybody write?

<Club Members>
"Summer Festival." "Summer Festival." "Fireworks." "Mosquito Coils."

<Mion>
"Oh, Rena and I have the same answer!
 Alright! Two points!"

<Rena>
"But Satoko's 'Fireworks' was pretty good too.
 Rika's 'Mosquito Coil' is a very nice seasonal choice as well."

<Rika>
"...All the choices are quite invigorating."

<Mion>
"It's almost summer break, isn't it.
 ...I wonder how we'll spend it this year."
Invigorating words that invoke the image of summer break.
 Certainly things that enrich the soul.
As everybody approaches the soon-to-come summer break... a plethora of dreams should be etched upon their thoughts...

<Satoko>
"...By the way... Keiichi-san, what did you answer?
 Hurry up and show us."

<Keiichi>
"Ah.... I di-didn't really write down anything that great..."

<Mion>
"No no no!
 Showing us is part of the rules!! Now come on!"

<Keiichi>
"Ah... stop it!
 D-Don't look!!!"
"Homework."

The room went silent.
...Nobody could really follow up that response.
It's as if my impertinent answer had somehow sullied the wonderful dreams of the coming summer break...

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun's summer breaks...
 ...
were never fun, were they..."

<Rika>
"...It's alright.
 Let's spend the summer this year with everybody.
 ...We won't leave you by your lonesome."
Rika-chan gently petted my head.
Wh-what exactly did summer break mean to me...
...Summer courses.
Observing sunflowers.
Practice exams.
Special summer focus seminars.
...I know nothing of hot summers.
 Because I've always been in an air-conditioned cram school...
...Ugh... the tears... they...

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan's summer breaks were always devoid of hopes and dreams, weren't they..."

<Keiichi>
"Wa... WaaaaAAaaaaAaaaaaaaAAAaaaaa!!!
 Don't look at me with such pity in your eyes! Don't look at meeeheeeeheeeeeeeeeEEEeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
...This game called 'Sympathy' may be more terrifying than I could ever imagine...

<Mion>
"Well, anyhoo!
 Rena and I get 2 points each!!
 Let's keep going!! ...Next is...
 'Fish'!!!"
So, it's "Fish"!
 Come to think about it, I haven't eaten sushi in a while.
By the way, rather than lean tuna, I'm quite the connoisseur on things like flounder!
...I wonder who I'll match with this answer.
Because for a Japanese person, anyone would think of this.

<Keiichi>
"Alright, everybody!
 This time we'll start from mine!!
 Ready, go!!"
"Sushi."

How about that for an answer!
When you see a lively fish, do you want to steam it or grill it?
No, to have fresh sashimi is the epitome of cuisine!
Rather than write "sashimi," however, I'll choose the more amiable term in "sushi" - That is my cunning ploy!!
...But contrary to the intrepid resolve of my reply, everybody's expression was listless.

<Rena>
"Oh. That's right...
 When you say 'Fish'... ...I see.
 ...Sushi is tasty, isn't it."

<Keiichi>
"Wa-aaaaaaAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
 Stop talking to me in that consoling tone! Stop iiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"

<Mion>
"Well then, should the rest of us show our answers?
 Ready, go!"

<Club Members>
"Dolphin."

" Whale."

" Aquarium."

" Aquarium."


<Satoko>
"Rika and I have the same answer!
 That's 2 points!!"

<Mion>
"Rena picked whale, eh?
 I thought about that too,
 but I ended up picking dolphin."

<Rena>
"Ah, really!?
 Rena wanted to write dolphin at first... but Rena didn't think anybody else would write it..."

<Rika>
"...Either one of them is very kyute."
Everybody, excluding me, stopped and stared blankly as their thoughts drifted over the horizon. It seems as if they can hear the roar of the open sea from over there...

<Satoko>
"This means everybody has 2 points!
 Well... everybody but Keiichi-san!"

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun's answers...
 were worth 0 points,
 ...but Rena thinks they were very unique and interesting! Interesting!"

<Mion>
"To immediately think of food when you hear the word fish.
 ...Kei-chan, you should really be ashamed of how destitute your soul is, huh."

<Keiichi>
"WaaaAAAaaaaaaaaaaaAAaaaaa!!

 Don't say something like my soul is destituuuuuuuuUUuuuuuuuuuute!!
 Besides, what's with Mion and Rena's answers, anyways!
 Those aren't even fish!
 Those are mammals!!"

<Mion>
"Objection overruled!!
 Next!!"
Wh-What a horrid game this is today!!
As the games pile on and on, it seems as if I will be further exposed as a petty human being!!
I'm the only one who still hasn't earned any points!!
 I want to at least get a point in the next round!!

<Mion>
"Alright, the next topic is...
 'Sakura'!"
Dammit!!
 This time I'll do it!!
Keep your cool, Keiichi Maebara!
Don't think what you would normally think!
Everybody else here is a girl!
Stop thinking like a man!!
If you write down "Sakura Mochi" here you'll only be repeating the tragedies of the past!
Throw away that gastrocentric male sensibility!
Just for now think of yourself as a girl!
You are a girl...
 You are a girl...
 I am a girl...!!!

<Mion>
"Everybody finished writing!?
 Let's do it!!"

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san, if you don't start getting points right now, won't it be a bit dangerous~?"
Hmph!
 This time it's perfect.
 I've completely suppressed my own instincts.
This time... I will have a match!
 No, I will *make* it match!!!

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, you seem pretty confident about this one!
 You see this time, Rena thought like a boy so I could match up with your answer.
 Ehehe~... 'Sakura Mochi'☆"

<Rika>
"... I like them too.
 I wrote it down."
Rena and Rika giggled together.

<Keiichi>
"WhooOOOOOooooaaaaaaahh!!

 Now is not the time to think with your stomach!!"

<Satoko>
"Well then, did Keiichi-san write the same answer as me? I put down 'Hanami'!"

<Mion>
"That's riiiight!
 When you say 'Sakura' it just has to be 'Hanami,' yeah?
 I wrote that down too!"
Mion and Satoko's response was 'Hanami'!
 'Hanami,' seriously!?!?

<Keiichi>
"Th-Th-That's the kind of event where old geezers getting drunk and doing all sorts of depraved things is the standard, isn't iiiiiiitttt!!!

<Keiichi>
And why of all times did you just decide to abandon answering from a girl's point of view!!"

<Mion>
"Well then, Kei-chan.
 ...What sort of girly response did YOU write down?"

<Keiichi>
"I-I-It's nothing!!
 Let's move on to this next topic, moving o-- ...Ah."
Before I knew it, Rika-chan had circled behind me and was intently reading the memo I had hidden behind my back.

<Rika>
"...It says 'lipstick.'"
It became dead quiet.
The abrupt silence enveloped the room.
It would be fine if somebody at least laughed at me or played it off as something dumb... but nobody even flinched.
The feeling in the pit of my stomach reached critical mass, causing my once blood-drained face to flush with a sudden wave of heat.

<Keiichi>
"Sa--
 Sa-Sa--

Sakura can only mean that famous lipstick brand 'Sakura,' right!?!? 

<Keiichi>
You know, the one in a new color they've been talking about on TV, they even did a special on it!
 Don't you check these things out, as ladies?
 Even I've seheheeen iiiiiiiiit!!!!"

<Mion>
"...Um yeah, even without the forced explanation, I know about it.
 It's the one that doesn't stick to the cup even if you're drinking coffee, right?
 Yeah.
 I know, I know."

<Rena>
"Yup, yup.
 It's a really kyute color, isn't it!
 I saw it in the makeup section at the drug store.
 That pink color made me want to take it home~"

<Satoko>
"I-indeed.
 It's only common sense for a lady to keep up on these matters!"

<Rika>
"I thought you were more interested in the bargain-sale tissues, Satoko."

<Satoko>
"How rude of you! I make sure to keep an eye on the newest products!"

<Mion>
"That aside, it's just a bit surprising that's the first thing you think of when you hear 'Sakura'...
"Wh- whaaaat?
 I was just thinking from a ladies perspective!!"

<Keiichi>
"Being born as a lady, obviously it's normal to maintain a beautiful image!
 It's right to think thaaaaaaat!!
 That's how it has to beeeeeeeee!!"
*poomph*
Mion quietly put her hand on my shoulder.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan.
 ...Now I am certain.
 ...Kei-chan, you are to your very core...
 A geezer.

 Irrevocably so."

<Keiichi>
"GyaaaaaaaaAAAaaaaaAAA!!

 Why is everybody looking at me with those eyes filled with piittttttyyyyyyyyy!!!"

<Rena>
"Th-That's not true, Keiichi-kun...
 Ok!
 Let's do our best!
 Here's where the comeback begins!"

<Satoko>
"There's no coming back for Keiichi-san the geezer!!
 Now give up quietly and accept your penalty!!"
Wh-What was today's penalty game again... !?

<Rika>
"Dressing up as a maid, complete with hairband and knee socks, while carrying around the winner's stuff."

<Keiichi>
"Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"


<Mion>
"Alright!!
 If you're real members of this club, show me you won't let anybody come back from this disadvantage!!
 Alright, alright, let's keep it rolling!!"
...Heh heh heh.

<Keiichi>
"Aaaahahahaha...!!!"

<Rena>
"Whoa, Keiichi-kun seems happy? ...Why!? How can this be!?"

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!
 He's probably awoken to the joys of cross-dressing~."

<Rena>
"Ah, Keiichi-kun, your hairband is going to fall off.
 Let me fix that for you."
Rena cheerfully adjusted the hairband that had been enshrined upon my head.

<Mion>
"How does it feel, Kei-chan?
 Have you awoken to the pleasures of wearing girl's clothing in front of actual girls~?

<Mion>
Be honest now.
 It's alright!
 We won't laugh~!!"

<Keiichi>
"Argggghh!!!!
 You jerk!!!
 I'm gonna murder you!!"
Swinging Mion's bag about wildly, I chased her in circles for a bit.
Today's loser was quickly decided to be me.
When I had been assured of finishing last, Mion showed her true power!!
She began racking up points with an iron fist. In the end, we didn't even have to add up the score to know who was on top.
After that, in the changing room...
 With much wailing and gnashing of teeth,
 pushing the boundaries of shame and brutality, I was instructed by Mion on how to put on everything from ribbons to underwear...
...D-Damn you Mion... What do you mean, knowing this will come in handy one day...

<Keiichi>
"How the bloody hell will a man knowing how to put on an apron-dress be usefuuuuuUUul!!!"

<Mion>
"Shhhhh!!
 Kei-chan, you're too loud!
 If you stay quiet you might be able to pass this off as rehearsal for a play~."

<Rena>
"Sh-She's right...
 If you cause a scene here...
 Th-They'll...
 discover you're a person with... 'unique' tastes."
UnggooooOOOOOooooaaaaaaaAAAaaaa!!
I shuddered from head to toe, resisting the urge to scream.

<Mion>
"Actually, Kei-chan, you have really smooth skin.
 Are you often told that it's easy to apply makeup on you?"
Saying that, Mion gently rubbed my cheek.
UwhoAA! What kind of man gets praised for being easy to apply makeup on them?

<Mion>
"How does it feel wearing a maid's hairband?
 It really finishes off the look!
 The hairband is the best part of a maid outfit, after all~!"

<Keiichi>
"Wh-Wh-What do you mean, finishes off the look!?
 Dumbass!
 Stop teasing me!!"

<Rena>
"Hehehehe!
 Keiichi-kun is embarrassed. Kyuuuuute~...☆"

<Mion>
"That's right.
 Men enjoy frilly clothing, after all.
 So, how does it feel wearing one yourself☆?"

<Keiichi>
"I d-d-don't really feel a-anyth--!
 Hey! Stop it!
 Don't flip it up!!"

<Mion>
"Makes your heart jump, doesn't it?
 Can you feel the air on your legs as you walk?"
S-Stop~...!
 Don't whisper such strange things in my ear~!!
H-Hau...!
 My miserable manhood subtly shifted.... eek~...!

<Mion>
"You're turning red, you're turning red.
 ...Have you finally realized it?
 That's right.
 Right now, Kei-chan is... exactly the type of maid that every healthy male wants."
Stop it, Mion~!
 Really, why do you have to whisper that right in my ear!!!

<Mion>
"Have you ever just wanted to hold a maid close to you...?
 Kei-chan, you've currently become one with that maid.
 Don't you see?
 That's a distance far closer than mere touch can ever achieve. 

<Mion>
...There, can't you hear that pulse... that breath...?"

<Rena>
"Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi-Mii-chan... That's... Hau...!"
On the verge of overheating, a long red line flowed out of Rena's nose.

<Mion>
"Putting on makeup properly, making you wear a wig with the straight, long hair you like so much...
 ...Kei-chan, I've made you into your ideal woman...
 And now, you're going to walk around town with me. 

<Mion>
You'll surely monopolize the eyes of all the men.
 ...That would definitely make you feel really good, wouldn't it...?

<Mion>
If o~nly you didn't have that one body part, you'd be a real girl~~!!"
Saying that, she tried to flip my skirt!!
 WaAa!!
 This is definitely NOT the time!!
 I can't let them see me with this male-centric probleeeeeeem!!
*CRASH* *THUD*
Before I realized it, Rena was caressing my head and rubbing me with her cheek.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, when you were fidgeting like that, you were su-su-su-su-supeeer kyute!!
 I-Iiiii'm going to take you hooome~~~!!!"
Peering through Rena's vice-like embrace, I saw Mion laying spreadeagle on her back.
...I see.
This must be what Satoko and Rika-chan feel like when they become Rena's prey...
After that, it took quite some time to calm Rena down from her frenzy...

<Mion>
"Later, Kei-chan.
 Today was super enjoyable... hee hee hee!!"

<Keiichi>
"You will rue this day, Miooonnn~!!!
 This disgrace shall be returned tenfold!!
 I'll achieve an overwhelming victory, make you wear something even crazier than this, and take you home!"

<Mion>
"Gyaaaahahahaha!!
 Only if you can beat me!
 I look forward to seeing you try!"
Mion tossed me my clothes, and looking in as good a mood as I've ever seen her, left.

...Okay now.

<Keiichi>
"...Now that I've been released by Mion, I can't waste even a second running home."

<Rena>
"By the way.
 Rena isn't as good as Mii-chan.
 ...So if we happen to bump into anybody, I won't be able to follow up for you, okay☆?"
Soon after that, I went into a full-out dash!!
I'm pretty sure I was running the 100m in about 6 seconds there.

<Rena>
"Well then, Keiichi-kun.
 See you tomorrow~!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah! See you tomorrow!!!"
The fact that I didn't bump into anybody I knew was probably divine favor for my constant good behavior!
It's been going my way today...
At that moment the front door opened, as if somebody was waiting for me.

<Keiichi's dad>
"Oh, Keiichi.
 So you're home.
 ...I was just about to go for a walk."
...I was dumbstruck by how slow my father was to react.
...A normal person would have realized the peculiar scene before them around: "Oh, Keiichi."

<Keiichi>
"Ah, umm... Dad.
 ...This is ...you see, you know that club I'm always talking about? This is one of the penalty games we do there...
 It just so happened I lost today..."
...My dad placed his hand on my shoulder.
It was an oddly moist, and uncomfortably warm hand...

<Keiichi's dad>
"...Keiichi.
 Let's have a little talk in my studio.
 We'll keep it a secret from Mom, of course!!!"

<Keiichi>
"N-No Dad, let go!!
 T-There's a show I want to watch right now!!!"
Mion, you shall rue this day!!!!
His artistic flame raging like wildfire, my dad dragged me along. I disappeared into the depths of the studio...

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi, are you home?
 Oh, you were in the bath.
 ...Is that... makeup remover?"

<Keiichi>
"Uh... I-- wahahahahahahaha!!!
 M-More importantly, what's the matter?"

<Keiichi's mom>
"Sorry.
 I have a headache and don't think I can make dinner tonight.
 I'm terribly sorry, but can you go out to eat with your Dad?"
My mom is a go-get-em superwoman at work, but it occasionally takes a toll on her health.
So this kind of situation is hardly a rarity.

<Keiichi>
"That's fine but...
 What will you eat?"

<Keiichi's mom>
"If it's just for myself, I can probably find a way to scrounge something together.
 Take care."

<Keiichi's dad>
"Keiichi~!!
 We'll take the car so hurry up!"
Dad quickly got the car ready.
He must be hungry, he really only moves so energetically when it's time to eat.

<Keiichi>
"Sorry to keep you waiting.
 So, where are we going to eat?"

<Keiichi's dad>
"...Hmmm.
 I recently found a nice store. Let's go there!"
My dad usually only complains about things. For him to actually praise something is... unexpected.
I wonder what kind of place it is that he'd rank it 3 stars.
As one who seeks the way of the gourmand, I, Keiichi Maebara, am genuinely intrigued!
The headlights of the car cut through the early darkness of the Hinamizawan night, carving a straight path towards town.
I was pondering where such a gem of a restaurant could be hidden away... it was, shockingly, the family restaurant right by the station.

<Keiichi>
"Dad... that great restaurant you were talking about... was this?"
The words "Angel Mort" were written on a very family restaurant-esque cartoonish logo.
It had the air of a girl-oriented all-you-can-eat cake buffet rather than a proper restaurant.

<Keiichi's dad>
"You've never been inside, Keiichi?"
Come to think of it... I hadn't.
There's been some times where I've travelled to faraway towns to eat.
But, returning only as far as Okinomiya Station, there was really no reason to dine out.
Home was just a stone's throw away after all.
...I see.
 That was the reason I never noticed it before.
We stopped the car in the restaurant's parking lot.
 ...It seems like business is booming.
 There's quite a few cars parked here.
But what really amazes me are the license plates.
...There's a lot of them that can't be from this area.
...Fukuyama, Nagoya-- well that's fine...
...
 Chiba!?
 ...Saitama!?
Opening up my mental geography book, I calculated how long it would have taken to get here via the major highways...

<Keiichi's dad>
"Heh heh heh.
 Keiichi, it seems that you've finally realized how amazing this restaurant is..."

<Keiichi>
"W-What's the meaning of this!?
 How can so many people travel from so far away just to come to this restaurant!?"
Following my dad, I climbed the steps and entered the building.
The bell attached to the door clattered as we entered, and a waitress soon greeted us. After confirming our party size and whether we wanted a smoking or non-smoking seat, she guided us inside.
Dad ordered two of the daily specials.
It seemed that they were ready-made, so there wasn't much of a wait at all until our meals were brought to us.
The taste was - no offense to Dad - not so different from your run-of-the-mill family restaurant...

<Keiichi>
"...If you're just talking about the taste... it seems like normal family restaurant fare."

<Keiichi's dad>
"Who gives a damn about the taste, Keiichi!
 See~...
 Isn't it great~☆"
...I see.
It just may be... that the food here might be nothing more than average.
The demographic of the customers was pretty much all young men.
...It may call itself a "Family Restaurant," but there wasn't a single table with a family.
And yet it was packed.
The parking lot was filled with cars from all corners of the country.
...If they didn't come from far and wide to eat this completely mediocre food... then there's only one other reason.
Dad flagged down a nearby waitress.

<Keiichi's dad>
"Excuse me~, the dessert that comes with the meal still hasn't come yet~."

<Waitress>
"Oh... I—!
 I-I'm so sorry..."

<Keiichi's dad>
"There's a dessert that comes with Daily Combo A.
 I've been waiting for quite a while."

<Waitress>
"Oh it's— ...M-My apologies. I'll bring it right away!"
The apparently rookie waitress rushed off flustered.

<Keiichi>
"...Dad.
 ...Could it be this restaurant is..."

<Keiichi's dad>
"Aren't they great~?
 The waitress's uniforms here, I mean~~♪."
BAM!!

<Keiichi's dad>
"W-W-What are you doing, Keiichi!?
 My own father never hit me!"

<Keiichi>
"I'm your son!!"

<Keiichi's dad>
"Listen, Keiichi, I've never come here with impure intentions.

<Keiichi's dad>
That belle and attirante and excentrique clothing, quel effet!
 It is my artistic muse!
 I wanted you to feel that!!
 Even you must have yearned for this stimulation!!
 Haven't you!? 

<Keiichi's dad>
Coming here alone, though, is a bit embarrassing.
 You understand!!
 That's why I dragged you here!
 Just blame me!
 Even if you must condemn me... I wanted you to know this feeling KeiichiiiIIIIiiiii!!!


<Keiichi's dad>
.... Aah...

 I need to take a leak..."
My father has always had a bad habit of trying to hide his embarrassment using incomprehensible nonsense as a smokescreen.
 ...I want to believe that this weirdness won't be genetic.
Continuing his one-sided rambling, my father stood up and headed to the washroom.
With him gone, I was left alone in the booth.
...Finally, at this time, a feeling of embarrassment welled up inside me.
...I had nothing to do but go beet-red with shame.
The waitress from before returned, her eyes alternating between the order slip and the table.

<Waitress>
"Uh... ummm..."
Arriving at my seat, she hesitantly tried to say something.
A more veteran waitress offered some advice from over her shoulder.
...Just calm down, and say "Sorry for the wait...!"

<Waitress>
"Ummm... Terribly sorry for the wait..."
Right, right, just like that!
 Do your best!
Whispering that into her ear, the veteran waitress left.
This waitress must have just been hired.
With an absolute lack of confidence, she moved hesitantly and maybe even somewhat perilously. Just watching her put me on edge.
I silently watched as she placed the dessert on the table with an inexperienced hand.
...But... it's just as Dad said... what incredible uniforms these are...
They were like... a bunny girl plus a maid plus some sort of frilly outfit, all in a perfect ratio... most certainly a rather dubiously charming kind of fashion. 
...In any case, she in no way appeared to be a proper waitress.
What should I do... I was catching glimpses of too many things... that is... I didn't know where I should look.
Wearing something like that walking around the restaurant... it's as bad as it can be for digestion...☆
Even though she was wearing the outfit, this particular waitress had no idea what to do either.
This flustered state, without a doubt, should be attributed to the amount of bare skin showing rather than being new to the job.
Both the waitress and I mutually avoided eye contact... what a platonically embarrassing feeling this is.
...I'm a customer you know!?
It's alright to be more straight-forward!
....Hau~... my nose is starting to bleed~ ...
At that moment, our eyes just happened to meet.
Both of us blinked, doubting who we were looking at.
...What?
 This is...

<Keiichi>
".........
Mion, is that you?"

<Waitress>
".........Eh..."
On top of her hair being let down, she was so far removed from her usual confidence-filled attitude...
 I didn't realize it was her at all.
It was Mion!!!
 Why is she here!?

<Keiichi>
"You...
 Why are you working at a place like this...!?"

<Waitress>
"Uh,
 Ah,
 Ummm,
 ...I-I'm helping out at my uncle's store..."
Come to think of it... I did hear her talk about how her relatives have stores in town, and that she sometimes works part-time to help them!

<Keiichi>
"......
 Oooh~~~!
 That must be a lot of work."
The nervous feeling I had dissipated in an instant.
Knowing that this was Mion, there was no reason to feel that way.
Well, actually... my animal instinct tells me that the power balance between Mion and myself has been turned upside-down!
 That's right, I'm a customer!
 My position is superior to hers!
The humiliation from today's penalty game was cutting through the recesses of my mind...
There really is a God!
For Him to grant me this opportunity for revenge!!!
Noticing the flames of vengeance burning in my eyes, Mion took a step back.

<Keiichi>
"But... seeing it like this, this type of clothing suits you very nicely, doesn't it~☆."

<Waitress>
"I-It's embarrassing, so...
 ...Don't look so much..."
I confirmed my pre-emptive strike was a clean hit!
There's no mistaking that Mion is currently defenseless!!
While confirming my attack was successful I simultaneously lined up the combo!!

<Keiichi>
"Mion, you have pretty big breasts, I might catch a glimpse at any moment.
 All the customers are definitely looking at you~!"

<Waitress>
"D-Don't... say... that..."

<Keiichi>
"Don't play coy with me~!
 I know that you enjoy drawing all the male attention with that embarrassing get-up~!
 I mean, if you didn't, there's no way you'd dress up like that~!"

<Waitress>
"I-It's not like... I'm doing this... because I like to..."
I-Is this alright, Keiichi Maebara?
 A-Aren't you taking this a little too far!?
Even if it's payback for that humiliation during the day... isn't this too much?
Hey, shut up, Logic!!
To pay back Mion tenfold is a chance you'll hardly ever get!!!

<Keiichi>
"Wearing this kind of get-up, your mother must be disappointed~!"

<Waitress>
"*whimper*"

<Keiichi>
"That part where you can almost just see something is the best!
 Come closer~!!"

<Waitress>
"Eek~ ...Please stop~...!"

<Keiichi>
"You still lack the spirit of service towards your customers!!"

<Waitress>
"P-Please forgive me~...!"

<Keiichi>
"Hau~~~I wanna take you home~~~♪"

<Waitress>
"No, not thaaaAAaaaat~...!"
Entering a version of Rena's Kyute Mode, blood spewing from my nose like a waterfall, I was going until I had no regrets!
 I was going to complete this verbal humiliation pla... --I mean-- revenge for today's events.

<Keiichi>
"Yup! I'll spare you the rest for today. ......Hau~~☆."
It seems that Mion's neural circuits had completely shorted from the embarrassment.
I might have teased her a little too much, or so I thought. But such a meek Mion is something you hardly ever see, so this was good for now.
 ...Leaving aside what exactly was 'good.'

<Keiichi>
"I never knew.
 To think that the High-and-Mighty Mion would have a hard time being a waitress!"

<Waitress>
"......*whimper*...Um,
 ...Th-That's wro--"

<Keiichi>
"This is such a surprising side of you~!
 I want to show this to the Mion from this afternoon!
 ...Actually, I want to show Rena and the others.
 Rena will definitely flip out with joy! 

<Keiichi>
Do you think she'll say she wants to work here?"

<Waitress>
"Th-That's.... wrong..."

<Keiichi>
"I could never imagine in my wildest dreams that such a kyute outfit would suit you Mion!"

<Waitress>
"I-I'm saying that's wrong!!"
While turning bright red, Mion finally spit out the words that were lodged in her throat.

<Keiichi>
"What do you mean,
 ...That's wrong?"

<Waitress>
"I-I'm!
 .........
Not Mion!!!"
...Wha?
 I was taken aback at Mion's confusing words.

<Keiichi>
"If you're not Mion... then who are you?
 You're Mion Sonozaki right?"

<Waitress>
"Umm...... I'm sorry.
 I should have said this earlier but...
 My name is Shion Sonozaki.
 ...Mion is my older sister."
My eyes unconsciously widened with surprise from this brazenly crazy talk.
Mion, probably thinking that there was no way such a far-fetched excuse would work, turned bright red while fidgeting nervously.

<Keiichi>
"Shion...?
 Shion Sonozaki?"

<Shion>
"Y-Yes...
 I'm often mistaken for my sister..."

<Keiichi>
"But, when we met, you had the kind of response that you wouldn't make if we were meeting for the first time."

<Shion>
"Th-That's because... my sister is always talking about you... so I knew who you were..."
A little bit of a cringeworthy excuse, that is.
...But... when I looked at Mion's eyes, which begged me to believe her, the urge to tease completely subsided.
To us, Mion had to be a leader who was normally overflowing with confidence, a guiding force.
If I were to lash out at that Mion, I would have ruined something I shouldn't have.
 That was something I would never wish for.
So I understand.
 This foolishness here, is something very different from the everyday Mion.
 That's why... she's "Shion."

<Keiichi>
".........I see.
 In that case...
 I'm sorry."

<Shion>
"O-Oh no, as long as you understand.
 My sister has a lot of enemies, you see."
Well now, she's self-aware of that fact now is she.
As I unintentionally laughed aloud, Mion --no, Shion-- laughed with me.

<Keiichi>
"Shion, is this your first time in this sort of job?
 It doesn't seem like you're used to it."

<Shion>
"Actually, today is... umm... Kei-chan is my first customer."
A little flustered after saying that, she quickly asked if it was okay for her to refer to me the same way her sister did.
...Seeing that blatant quirk was so cute, I couldn't stop laughing.

<Keiichi>
"So, you said you've worked part-time at your uncle's store before?
 I thought you would have been more used to it."

<Shion>
"Oh, I have other relatives that run shops.
 That's why... this is the first time I'm helping the uncle that owns this place..."
I see, makes sense.
 Anybody would be tentative doing a job they weren't used to.

<Keiichi>
"Does Mion ever help out at this store?"

<Shion>
"Oh, my sister is, you see...
 She's not good with these cutesy things..."
...I know what she's trying to say.

<Keiichi>
"That's right.
 Mion is more suited for cool things!
 So I think having you help out here was the right choice."
"...Huh?"
 Shion asked, probably thinking she misheard me.

<Keiichi>
"That uniform; it would never suit somebody like Mion.
 ...But for Shion, I think it works."

<Shion>
"Huh,
 ......You mean that
 ...Ummm..."
Shion, like Rena often does, spaced out and turned bright red.

<Shion>
"Wh-...What does that mean... exactly..."
...At least for this moment, it felt like this Shion character actually existed.
...Because there was no way that the Mion I knew had this side to her.
At that moment, we realized that the more veteran waitress was waving at us from across the room.

<Waitress>
"Sonozaki-sa~n, you can take your break now~!"

<Shion>
"Oh, o-okay...!"
Mion finally returned to her senses. It seemed as if it was time for her to take her break.

<Shion>
"Well, then... I'll take my leave. It was fun talking to the infamous Kei-chan."

<Keiichi>
"Sorry for mistaking you for Mion and teasing you.
 Please tell Mion that I will have my revenge one day."

<Shion>
"Ah... that thing where you were forced to dress as a maid and walk around outside, right~?"
That devilish laugh and smile, it was exactly the same as the one I knew.

<Keiichi>
"That's right.
 Tell her that I will return the favor for the total humiliation I suffered!"

<Shion>
"Bleh~.
 More importantly, I'm going to complain to my sister about the teasing I had to endure today.
 My sister will have my revenge during your club activities! Ahahahaha...!"

<Keiichi>
"Ahahahaha! Bring it on!! I'll get her before she gets me!!"
Mion laughed with a warm smile devoid of any remaining nervousness, and disappeared into the back...
...I felt like I had a very valuable experience today.
That's right, for now I know the High-and-Mighty Mion has a weak point to panic and get embarrassed about...
But, of all things... for her to say she has a twin sister...
I thought that maybe I should ask Rena tomorrow if she really has a sister.
 ...But maybe it's better that I didn't ask.
 ...It's a bit mean-spirited.
I've decided that the person I met here today was "Shion," the younger twin sister.
 So, I'll refrain from doing anything that would deny that.
It's not that we actually made a promise or anything...
 ...But that little exchange gave birth to a new rule between me and Mion.
Somebody tapped me on the shoulder.
 It was my dad.
...That was a long trip to the washroom.
He probably came up with a new idea for an art piece when he was sitting on the can.

<Keiichi's dad>
"Keiichi, are you about ready?
 Let's go home."
Settling the bill, my father had his customer card stamped.
 ......It was pretty much filled.
 Damn, Dad, you're quite the regular customer...

<Keiichi's dad>
"Was that new waitress just now somebody you know, Keiichi?"

<Keiichi>
"Oh, so you were watching from the shadows..."
Dad has the oddest sense of tact sometimes...

<Keiichi's dad>
"Somebody from school?
 From Hinamizawa?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah. She's the little sister of my friend Mion.
 Her school isn't in Hinamizawa, so she must go to one in town.
 ...I've never seen her at my school."

<Keiichi's dad>
"Hmmm. So not all the kids in Hinamizawa go to the same school?"

<Keiichi>
"Only about half.
 The other half go all the way into town on their bikes."
In this way, the feeling that I was really talking to Shion came to me.
What should I say to Mion tomorrow?
 I met your little sister! ...Something like that?
Even with Mion being like that, us having a secret between the two of us made me both a little happy and a little embarrassed.



[Watanagashi Ch.3]


<Chie>
"Listen up, everybody.
 If you don't take cooking seriously somebody's going to get hurt.
 This is part of your education as well, so don't fool around and do it seriously!"
A lazy "yeaaah" wafted through the class in response.
Half of the school day today was going to be home economics class.
The plan was for everybody to make curry rice, and give it to the forest rangers who let this building be rented out as a school.
If everybody were making curry in the same pot, it would have been more of a party-like atmosphere, but this was school, after all!
Excluding the youngest students, each one of us would be making our own curry, with the results being judged.

<Chie>
"Alright, everybody.
 It may be that nowadays curry is an easy meal anybody can make, but it has its roots in traditional Indian cuisine.

<Chie>
Even though we've altered it a bit in the Japanese style, it is still instilled with the knowledge and culture of Ancient India.
 Absolutely do not neglect that fact.

<Chie>
I'll have words with anybody who doesn't take this seriously, so be prepared for that."
...That seemed like a needlessly passionate sermon on curry. ...Well, whatever.

<Satoko>
"It's rumored that Chie-sensei has devoted her life to curry.
 She'll probably be a pretty strict judge."

<Keiichi>
"As long as you're not failing, your grade in Home Ec doesn't really matter. Doesn't really matter at all."

<Rena>
"I wouldn't say that if I were you...
 The teacher's a tyrant when it comes to curry."

<Keiichi>
"...What the heck does that even mean? A Curry Tyrant?
 ...Never heard of that before."

<Mion>
"You see, our normally mild-mannered teacher...
 ...for some unfathomable reason is a stickler for curry!
 Oh, passionately so!!"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 It's said that every year she goes on a journey to India to research mythical curry."

<Satoko>
"...This is just a rumor, but... It seems that she eats curry rice three meals a day, and if she occasionally has something else, it always has to be curry flavored."

<Keiichi>
"That's... not unyielding, that's unnatural.
 Is she part of an evil cult or something...?

<Keiichi>
 Besides, doesn't curry top the list when it comes to junk food? 
Curry three times a day is just weird nutritionally speaking and—"
*THUNK THUNK THUNK*
Embedded into the table right by my fingertips—a chef's knife, ladle, and spatula—hummed gently as they still quivered.
The teacher, while still mixing her own pot, was looking this way, smiling.

<Mion>
"Ke-Kei-chan, shhhhhhh!!
 ...If you say any more you'll be sleeping with the fishes...!!"
Saying even a little bit more would make my situation a lot more dire.

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, yeah.
 ...Just be serious and make your curry properly and everything's good, alright?"

<Rika>
"...I don't think it's going to be that easy today."

<Rena>
"Look... Mii-chan is..."
...It's written all over her face.
...If the playing field is even, and we're being judged... There's no way this won't turn into a competition!

<Mion>
"It looks like we're all on the same page!!
 It's a Cooking Conteeeesst!!"
I knew it!!
 There's no way Mion would leave such an enticing event alone!

<Satoko>
"How shall we determine the victor?
 By how the teacher judges it?"
As if saying "but wait, there's more!

<Chie>
"The purpose of today's event is to show appreciation for the people at the Forestry Service, so they'll be judging the results with me."

<Principal>
"Yup. Your teacher and I, as well as five people from the Forestry Service, will be judging your cooking!
 Good luck to everyone!!
 Gahahaha!!!"
E-Even the principal!?!?
Looking around, it seemed like the interests of everybody in the class had been piqued.

<Mion>
"So that's what's happening.
 This isn't going to just be some casual curry cook-off!"

<Rena>
"Rena is good at making curry!
 I'm not going to lose today!"

<Satoko>
"My grade is cooking in a group, so I'm together with Rika."

<Keiichi>
"Th-That's unfair!!
 I'm pretty sure that Rika is good at cooking!"

<Rika>
"...My curry is so tasty it'll send shivers down your spine."
What about Mion!?
She doesn't seem like she's too good at cooking.
Her type has always been bad at this kind of thing.
 ...But Mion continued to look unconcerned.

<Mion>
"Hehehe...
 ...I'll tell you what Kei-chan is thinking right now.
 ...'Mion is definitely bad at cooking.'
 ...Am I right~?"
I... I don't like the way she said that.
...It couldn't be... Mion couldn't possibly...
At that moment, the teacher's whistle sounded.

<Chie>
"Alright everybody, are you ready?
 Be very careful with the knives.
 Start~!!"
The call to arms had sounded!
We had to use an outdoor kit to cook the rice, but it wasn't that difficult for a camping veteran like me.
Put the rice into the canister, push your palm to the bottom... and fill with water to just above the wrist.

<Satoko>
"Are you alright with only that much water?
 If you don't put in more it could be bad."
You filthy liar.
If I put in any more, I'll just be left with some half-cooked porridge!

<Keiichi>
"Satoko, if that's meant to be a trick, it won't work.
 I'm used to cooking rice with these utensils!
 First it starts to bubble, then the steam starts to puff.
 And don't take off the lid no matter what!"

<Rena>
"Hmmm... Keiichi-kun, you're amazing!
 This is a little unexpected.
 Did you learn this at summer camp?"

<Keiichi>
"My dad really likes to go camping, see.
 Whenever summer comes around, our family goes a lot."

<Mion>
"So this means... everybody is good at cooking the rice.
 In other words, the critical part of this challenge will be the curry!"

<Satoko>
"Hmph!
 Curry is Rika's specialty!
 We'll cream you all!!"

<Keiichi>
"...You lost me at 'Rika's.'
 Why don't you help with the cooking too?"

<Rena>
"Hmmm,
 maybe... Satoko-chan is helping the most by doing nothing at all☆."

<Satoko>
"Eep!!!
 The ends justify the means!!! I just have to win!!!"
That was a pretty malicious comment for Rena.
And Satoko took it hook, line, and sinker. Rena could only apologize between fits of laughter while Satoko chased her around.

<Mion>
"Well now... should we move on to the curry?
 For now the battle truly begins!"
After rinsing off the carrots, potatoes, and other standard vegetables, I grasped the knife. ...*gulp*

<Rena>
"What~ will today's curry taste like~♪"
As Rena hummed along, her very well-practiced hands wielded her knife.
The rhythmical sound of the knife hitting the cutting board harkened to kind images of days long past.
 ...Simply put, it was perfect.
It was so calm and practiced... I seriously don't stand a chance!
I looked over at Satoko and Rika-chan.
...Satoko was in charge of washing the vegetables, while Rika-chan was in charge of peeling them.
...That's what I heard being discussed... but Rika-chan's knife-skills are something else as well!!
She was happily rotating the potato and peeling it quite quickly.
On top of that... the peels spanned the entire potato.
 What was that called again? Katsuramuki?
 I've heard that peeling a vegetable in one loop around like that is a highly-regarded technique.
She picked up the peel from the sink and carved a pair of eyes into it with her knife...

<Rika>
"...It's a snake. Roaaaar."
Saying that she placed the longly-peeled potato skin on top of the head of a boy from her group.
...She wasn't even breaking a sweat.
 ...When it comes to Rika-chan and cooking... I couldn't even hold a candle to her.
...But ...Roaaaar?
 Do snakes make that sound?
Alright then, how's Mion doing?
She's definitely just fumbling along!
There's no way she can peel a potato so effortlessly like that!
 Absolutely no way!!

<Keiichi>
"This can't be!!
 You've got to be kidding me!
 This a trick! She's using special effects!
 Where's the wire? She's definitely using a wire!"

<Mion>
"Hehehehe...
 Here, take a looksie."
As if she had already won, Mion proudly showed me the elongated potato skin.

<Rika>
"...You didn't know, Keiichi?
 Mii was taught how to cook by her grandma."

<Rena>
"Not just cooking~.
 From sewing to flower arrangement to playing the koto. From marksmanship to radio operation. Even helicopter piloting is but one of the myriad things she can do!"
...Strangely enough, the latter items were more realistic.
It was the first few items on that list that seemed like a lie.

<Rena>
"She's actually really good at cooking.
 ...It's just such a hassle that she never does it though~."
D-Dammit!!
I'm also really good at cooking!
 Especially Chinese food!!

<Rika>
"...Keiichi, boiling something and pouring it into a bowl doesn't count as cooking."
Shot down before I could even say it.

<Satoko>
"Oh ho ho!!
 Too bad for you!!
 Today Keiichi-san shall be assuredly languishing in defeat all alone!!!"
*clank!!!*

<Keiichi>
"Tough words from somebody who can't even cook by herself!!!"

<Satoko>
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
 Rikaaaaaa~"

<Rika>
"There there.
 ...I'll destroy Keiichi for you."
Gah! ...This does not look good...!
Everybody is smirking at me!
Don't raise the white flag yet, Keiichi Maebara!!
Don't throw away this match!
Calm down and think!
Not about how to peel these potatoes well.
 ...But about how to win this challenge!!

<Keiichi>
"...There's too many people watching.
 I'm... going to work at another sink."
Saying only that, I gathered up all the vegetables and left that spot behind...

<Rena>
"Will Keiichi-kun be alright?
 I'm worried he might cut himself with his knife..."

<Mion>
"Let's see what Kei-chan's doing~!"
No matter how hard I try peeling these, if I slip up at this speed I'll lop my fingers right off!
Then... there's only one thing left to do!!

<Keiichi>
"Tomita-kun, Okamura-kun!
 Oh, you guys were in a group of four, huh."
It was the two underclassmen that had become my sworn brothers ever since the event at that toy store last Sunday.
They had been paired with two girls for their group.

<Tomita>
"Yep.
 Both the girls are pretty good at cooking."

<Okamura>
"So both of us can just mess around and we'll be okay."
...Both of them pointed at the girls.
...They're not as good as Rena, but they were both good enough at handling a knife.

<Keiichi>
"I'll get straight to the point.
 At this rate, I'm going to lose this contest!
 Give me the vegetables your group has peeled already."

<Tomita>
"Ma-Maebara-san,
 ...That's pretty much theft.
 ...But depending on what's in it for us..."

<Okamura>
"In other words, it depends on the terms of negotiation."

<Keiichi>
"Hmph, quite bold of you guys!
 ...Well, that's to be expected.
 Then let's do this.
 If I win, I'll let you eat the curry that Satoko and Rika-chan's group makes.
 How about that?"

<Tomita>
"Eh,
 ...Ah.
 ...I-I don't know about that..."
Both of them were hesitant after such a weighty proposal... just one more little push seems in order.
Very well then, let's make them an offer they can't refuse.
...I pulled both of them close by the shoulders and made my offer in a hushed tone.

<Keiichi>
"...Of course, that includes the part that Satoko and Rika-chan have already eaten some of.
 I'll even throw in the spoons."
*splooge*
 A red mist spouted vigorously from the noses of the two underclassmen.

<Satoko>
"Hmm...?
 ...Keiichi-san... is also pretty good at this...!
 Those are some very nice potatoes."
Having brilliantly cleared the vegetable peeling challenge, I returned to my comrades in triumph.

<Rena>
"Whoa, amazing, amazing!
 Keiichi-kun's peeling is really good!"

<Mion>
"...Hmph.
 That's not quite right.
 What Kei-chan has bared isn't a potato, but his fangs!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah...
 I'm super serious about this.
 I'll crush you all!!"
Having finished with preparing the vegetables, next is to boil a pot of water, then add the vegetables in order of which takes longest to cook.
 ...I learned this part from my mother when we went camping.
But... just cooking in order... it probably won't garner a lot of points.
Look over at Rena... she had a variety of vegetables cooking together in a delicate balance.
She wasn't being ambitious or calculating a way to win the game.
 ...She was making delicious food with a mother's touch...
I have a feeling that I could somehow compete with Mion in terms of technique, but I would be no match for Rena...
...She was way out of my league...

<Rena>
"When my mother makes curry, you see, she always uses lots of ingredients.
 That's why Rena's curry uses a lot of ingredients as well.
 ...I really wanted to take all night and stew it nice and slow... hau."

<Keiichi>
"...I beg of you.
 Will you please help just a little with my curry..."

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha!
 No.
 This is one of our club activities!
 Rena won't lose~!"
Ugh, when she enters Club Mode, even the normally kind Rena becomes an enemy...
Looks like Rika-chan is cooking apples as well.
 ...Uggh ...she's like a pro at this.
How about Mion?

<Keiichi>
"Wha-- Mion you--!!
 What the heck is that!?
 Where did you get meat from!?"

<Mion>
"I predicted what we would be doing today by looking at the schedule.
 ...So I prepared accordingly.
 ....My curry is going to be... maaaahvelous~!!"
Upon closer inspection, it looks like Mion brought her own vegetables and spices and other ingredients... they were spread all over the place!!
Mion... just for today... you brought all this stuff from your house!!!

<Keiichi>
"O-Objection!!!
 Chie-sensei, there's no way this is allowed, is iiiit!?"

<Chie>
"Objection overruled.
 As long as it makes for delicious curry anything goes☆."
Ugh. For that normally serious teacher to go so far as to append a star to the end of her sentence!!
Just as the rumors said... she's a through-and-through curry freak...

<Mion>
"Rena and Rika-chan are naturally-gifted chefs!
 I've come with thorough preparations!!
 ...And?
 Kei-chan, what about you?
 Hehehehe...!!"
...It's hopeless...
 In the grand scheme of cooking... peeling the vegetables is only a small part of it.
...The hurdles I must overcome are just too numerous... and too high!!

<Tomita>
"...Maebara-san, over here!"
Turning around, I saw the voices calling me belonged to the two underclassmen from earlier, Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun.

<Keiichi>
"What's up, you guys?
 ...Hmm?
 What's up with that pot? Is that from your group?"

<Okamura>
"Switch this with your pot before somebody notices.
 ...I think that the curry the girls from our group made, at the very least, is better than what you could make."
...Y-You guys... ...for me...!?

<Tomita>
"D-Don't get the wrong idea.
 I-If you don't win then we.... that is..."
Oh, that's right.
If I don't win, then the talk of eating Satoko and Rika-chan's curry goes right out the window!!
It seems like... you guys are getting riled up about this too...!

<Keiichi>
"Sorry!!
 I'm in your debt!!
 ...But, I'm surprised the girls in your group agreed to this."

<Okamura>
"Maebara-san.
 ...We're also... serious about this!"
Filling in on day duty three times.
 ...These guys... to assure me victory... have paid the price...!!!
That gaze filled with burning conviction from my underclassmen...!!
Yeah, I'm not fighting this alone.
 ...I'm fighting this with everyone!!!

<Keiichi>
"Leave it to me!!!!
 Save some room, boys.
 I'll definitely let you eat your fill!!!"

<Okamura>
""We shall be eagerly awaiting your victory!!""
It's a gas stove, so controlling the heat is easy.
All that's left is to let it stew a bit.
 The delicious smell of curry began wafting upwards...
The pot gifted to me by my two underclassmen certainly drew some double-takes.
Rena even looked surprised when she came to take a look, so it must be pretty good.

<Mion>
"....Kei-chan, you're pretty good.
 It look like this'll be a good match right to the bitter end!"

<Rena>
"Rena wants to eat Keiichi-kun's curry, curry!"

<Keiichi>
"Rena's curry and Mion's curry too... everybody is a worthy opponent.
 I've done my very best... but I'm not sure of the outcome..."

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san, Rika's calling you.
 Go see what she wants."
What?
 Rika-chan's calling me?
 What could it be?
 ...Well, whatever.
 ...While I'm at it I can gather some intelligence on the enemy.
Rika-chan was doodling on the ground in front of the pot.
...Because all that's left is to let it stew.
 ...Even then, it's good to know that she doesn't leave the stove unattended.

<Keiichi>
"Hey Rika-chan, how's yours doing?"

<Rika>
"...It's Mr. Curry."
...Huh?
 ...Rika-chan was doodling something strange, and introduced it as Mr. Curry.

<Rika>
"...Mr. Curry is amazing.
 He shoots beams from his eyes.
 ...Pew pew."
Apparently Mr. Curry shoots beams from his eyes.
Drawing a beam with a stick, she etched a line towards my feet.
 ...Does this mean, I've been shot with a laser?

<Keiichi>
"Uwhoaaaaaa!!
 Barrier!!
 Beam Reflect!!!"
I took another stick in my hand, and reflected the beam, striking Mr. Curry!!

<Rika>
"Mr. Curry can shoot missiles from his stomach.
 ...Psheewww."

<Keiichi>
"Hooowaaaahhh!!
 Maebara Super Electromagnetic Barrier!!!
 And Retaliatory Beam!!!"

<Rika>
"...Mr. Curry absorbs the beam energy and fires his Impulse Wave Cannon."
Rika-chan and I scratched at the ground, thoroughly engrossed in our doodle war.
 ....Wait a moment.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Rika-chan.
 ...You called me here for a reason, right?"

<Rika>
"...Yes, I called you.
 ...But I've already fulfilled my purpose."
At that moment, a chill ran up my spine.
 ...Already fulfilled... her purpose!?

<Keiichi>
"They, they got me!!!!!!!"
Headed back to my pot... standing there, just as I feared, was Satoko!!!
With no questions asked, I dropkicked the back of her head!

<Satoko>
"Wh-Wha-What do you think you're doing!!!
 You know better than to do that to a lady's head!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Who cares about that!?
 Satoko, did you mix something in with my curr—!!"

<Satoko>
"How impertinent.
 ...I haven't fallen that far.
 ...Despite what you may think, I'm a fair person, you know."

<Keiichi>
"...Then what's this incomprehensible line of ladles and plates!?
 Leaving them all in these unstable positions... if they fall over, what will you do!?"
At that moment, a gentle breeze blew by, knocking over a ladle that was stood up on its end.
The ladle, like a domino, fell over and knocked over the next cooking utensil in a row.
*whap whap whap whap*
 *clank clank*
 *thud thud*

<Keiichi>
"This is Art.
 ...Come to think of it, domino world record challenges were quite the rage on television a while back."

<Mion>
"K-Kei-chan!!!
 The frying pan!!!"
I didn't even have time to react.
...The chain reaction knocked over a cutting board...
 ...Then a frying pan
 ...
 ...The next after that was...
 My pot...
*CRASH*

The frypan struck my pot full-force, tipping it over!!
The contents cruelly spilled out... and now my masterpiece was being sampled by the schoolyard...
I stared, dumbfounded...
It was such a beautiful and elaborate mousetrap that for a moment, I lost touch with reality.

<Satoko>
"Oh my oh my, this is a catastrophe~!
 I didn't do anything, you hear me?
 Ooohohohoho!!"
...At the very last moment... I had let my guard down...!!
I ignored the culinarily incompetent Satoko for far too long...!!
Even if she couldn't cook, Satoko still had this method of fighting back!
Just then, Rena, who had been sampling her own pot, let out a scream.

<Rena>
"Wh-Whaat!?!?!
 Rena's curry is... salty? Salty!?"
Was Rena also sabotaged...!?
 Then what about Mion...!?

<Mion>
"My rice is saltyyyy!!
 I've been had!!"

<Satoko>
"Ooohohohoho!!!
 With this all the obstacles in my way have been taken care of before the fight even begins!!"

<Rika>
"...All that effort wasted.
 So sad, so sad."

<Satoko>
"So very very sad~"
Rika-chan and Satoko rubbed my dumbfounded head to their hearts' content...
Pushing the desks together, it was about time for the meals to be judged.
The delicious odor of curry spread throughout the courtyard...
The members of the Forestry Service, to whom we owed gratitude for their daily work, were guided to their seats.
The principal gave a bit of a ceremonial introduction. Next, the teacher expressed her desire for them to judge the curry contest.
The men from the Forestry Service seemed to like that kind of thing, and gave their enthusiastic approval.

<Chie>
"Well then, is everybody finished~?
 We'll now have all the judges sample your cooking~!"
Everybody in the class brought up their painstakingly made curry and arranged them on the desk.
The only club members who managed a decent result were Rika-chan's group...
Knowing full-well it was a failure, Rena plated her curry for the judges.
 She already knew she was going to get a low score.
But... at least she was still able to serve hers.
Both Mion's and my curry were completely obliterated, so we couldn't even line them up on the table...
The judges started from the curry made by the lower grades.
They had a lively discussion, praising the food.
Finally... it was our curry's turn.

<Principal>
"Next up is Ryuugu-kun's curry.
 Yes.
 ...This looks quite appetizing!!"
The principal cheerfully shoveled a spoonful of Rena's salty curry into his mouth...!!
Of course, his expression immediately changed.

<Chie>
"Oh my... what happened, Ryuugu-san?
 It seemed so delicious when you were cooking it..."
Chie-sensei must have had some expectations, judging from her disappointment.

<Rena>
"Hau.... I-I'm sorry...
 I might have added... a bag of salt by accident..."
The rest of the judges grimaced after they each had a bite.
 ...I feel sorry for them.

<Principal>
"Failure is but the seasoning for success!!
 I'm looking forward to next time!
 Do your best!!"
Saying that, the principal devoured the rest of the oversalted curry in one go. Truly a man amongst men.
Rena was down and out.
Her offensive capabilities were something else, but she was defeated due to her weak defense.

<Rika>
"...Well then.
 Please savor our curry next."

<Chie>
"I see that Furude-san's group put a lot of effort into their curry!
 Let's see here.
 ...Hmm.
 It's simple, but very nicely done☆."
There was also the incident with Rena's salted curry right before this, so the judge's assessment was extraordinarily high...!
Maybe not just extraordinary... but perhaps today's forerunner?
The judges began a heated debate.
One of those judges let out a sigh as he removed a chunk of carrot with his spoon.

<Staff Member>
"Yeah, this kid's curry really isn't half bad...
 ...but, I don't like carrots, you see."
Personally, I think that carrots are a staple of curry.
 ...But I guess to each their own.
However, seeing that, Rika-chan read the nameplate on the chest of his coveralls, and began to speak.

<Rika>
"...That's no good, Kyouji.
 You have to eat your carrots."
What is she saying all of a sudden...?
 Everybody turned to Rika-chan with a stunned look.
But
 ......
 What Rika-chan just did...
 Was super effective.
The carrot-hating judge began stuffing his face with curry while tears streamed down his face.

<Rika>
"......Kyouji.
 There's seconds if you want them."
*sob* "MOMMMMMMYYYYYYYY!!"
While crying like that he continued to shovel curry into his mouth!
That's right.
 ...Rika-chan's curry was by no means 'simple.'
 No... that curry had the taste of a mother's cooking!
With the carrot-hating judge out of the picture, Rika-chan's assessment was unanimous.

<Satoko>
"Ohoho.
 Nobody can stand up to Rika's curry!!"
Satoko let off a shrill laugh as she declared victory, but at that moment...!

<Mion>
"Don't be fooled, my esteemed judges!!
 Don't be deceived into thinking that this meager slop is the taste only a mother can provide!!
 What you people actually wanted to eat... was this kind of curry, wasn't it!?"
Ooooooohhh!!!!
All of a sudden, in all its perfect glory... Mion's curry!
Not only the judges, but the teacher, the underclassmen, and of course myself... could only gasp in admiration!!
Hamburg steak with a demi-glace sauce, and a fresh salad...!!
It's a set!!
It wouldn't be stretching it to say that this was a full course meal!!
 It's perfect... perfectly made!!!

<Rena>
"A-Amazing, amazing!!
 Mii-chan, you're amazing!
 Mii-chan, you're amazing!!!"
Satoko was also shocked.
Even Rika-chan couldn't hide her surprise.
It seems the victor was decided without even needing a taste.
Of course the hamburger was hand-kneaded.
The salad also had a homestyle dressing, but of professional quality.
And the curry, not even a micron of grit!!!

<Chie>
"This is sublime...
 Truly a taste to savor, Sonozaki-san!

<Chie>
This curry is no doubt... a living testimony to 6000 years of Indian knowledge in beautiful harmony with Japanese cuisine...
 ...I'm elated!
 This deserves full marks!!
 I'm giving it 100 points."

<Mion>
"Aww, you're welcome~.
 I'm just trying to set an example as class representative."
Mion bowed politely.
 ...And then winked at us with a smirk on her face!

<Rika>
"...I admit... defeat."

<Satoko>
"T-There's no way this is happening...!!
 I'm certain I sabotaged that pot of rice!!"
That's right.
Satoko had dumped salt into Mion's rice cooker, which should have ruined it!!!
At that moment, it hit me. I spun back towards my own canister.
...T-That's whHhyyyyYYYyyy!!
At some point, my cooking canister had been opened, its contents completely emptied.

<Keiichi>
"D-Damn you MioooooooOOooon!
 You used my riiiIIiiiiiiiiiiice!!!
 That's no faaaAAaaiiirr!!
 Hand over half of your cuuuUUurry!!"
Mion clucked her tongue and waved her finger at me as a smirk washed over her face.

<Mion>
"Whoa there, Kei-chan, you're not taking this seriously enough.
 You gave up at the last moment.
 I didn't.
 That's the difference between us.
 As soon as you give up, it's all over!!"
Gah...!! I couldn't even properly voice my shame...!

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, I feel sorry for Keiichi-kun.
 ...Just give him at least a little..."

<Mion>
"It's fine, it's fine.
 This is a lesson.
 Kei-chan just learned that you shouldn't give up on the contest until it's all over... right?"
It loathes me to say it but... Mion is right!
To give up so quickly on the match was my own folly...!!
For Mion to have brought that to my attention... I should actually be thankful to her...!
Well then... did that mean that even in this situation, I shouldn't give up!?

<Keiichi>
"My curry was overturned while it was still in the pot, and I don't even have any rice left...
 How in the blazes am I not supposed to lose hope in this situation!?"

<Tomita>
"Ma-Maebara-san......"
Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun suddenly appeared.
Dammit...!!
Even though my protégés had tried so hard...!!
I wasn't able to meet their expectations!!

<Okamura>
"I-It was an accident.
 ...There was nothing you could do."
Both of them were dejected...
 Gah... I couldn't accept defeat so easily.
 I was their senior!!
 What would I be if I didn't pick up the broken pieces of the dream I had shown them!!
I just learned it from Mion just now, didn't I?
 Don't throw away the contest!
 Not until the last moment!

<Keiichi>
"Think, Keiichi Maebara!!
 Think!!
 Not about how to make more curry, about how to win the match...!!!
 ......Hmmmm...
 AaaaaAAaaaaAah!!!!"

I had an idea.
...I didn't think it could turn the tables, but it was better than nothing!

<Keiichi>
"Tomita-kun, come and wash your hands. Help me out!!
 Okamura-kun, there's something I want you to find!!"

<Okamura>
""Okay! Gotcha!!""
Both of them dispersed after receiving these instructions.

<Mion>
"...Oh?
 How is Kei-chan going to flounder about at the end?
 ...Why don't you show me?"

<Satoko>
"Nobody likes a stubborn fool, you know~?"

<Keiichi>
"Shut up!
 Just sit there and watch the last card I have to play!!
 First off. Mion, I'll be taking some of your rice.
 I won't let you say no!!"

<Mion>
"......I don't really care. It's salty, after all."

<Rena>
"It's okay if Rena helps too, right?
 Keiichi-kun is in trouble right now."

<Keiichi>
"Hearing you say that is very reassuring!!!
 Well then, Rena!
 ......
Go make some tea."

<Rena>
"Hau.... he doesn't trust me."

<Keiichi>
"Next, Satoko!!
 Also, Rika-chan!!
 I challenge you to a side bet."

<Satoko>
"Wh-What did you saaaaaAAaaay!?!?"

<Rika>
"....We'll listen to your request."
This was my duty to my two protégés who shed blood, sweat, and tears for my sake.

<Keiichi>
"Satoko, Rika-chan... If I receive a perfect score...!!
 I'll be taking your curry.
 Nothing for you to eaaaaAAAaat!!!"


<Satoko>
"Y-You need to know when to stop joking around!!!
 I'll be giving a big NO to that!!!"

<Mion>
"...No, it's all right, Satoko.
 Take him up on it."
Firmly patting the top of Satoko's head, Mion said those words with all the gravitas of a Club President.

<Mion>
"You handicapped him this much, didn't you?
 There's no way he can make up for that.
 So meet him head on.
 ...No matter how hard he struggles, he's not going to make a comeback.
 Right?"

<Satoko>
"Grrrr... Th-That may be true, but......"

<Rika>
"...I don't mind.
 Keiichi. Go for it. Yaaay."
The judges, seemingly growing tired of sampling the various curries, were debating each entry.
...From what little I overheard, it seemed that Mion's impending victory was not in question...

<Chie>
"By the way... what happened to Maebara-kun's curry?
 I still haven't tried it yet."

<Keiichi>
".........Yeah.
 The pot with my curry in it...... fell over..."

<Principal>
"Hmph.
 ...Is that so?
 That's a real shame!!"

<Keiichi>
"...I may have lost my curry... but that doesn't mean I've lost this contest.
 ...I'll have everybody singing my praises!!"
My combative posturing had drawn the attention of all the judges...!!

<Keiichi>
"First of all, just be quiet and eat these, please.
 ...I'll listen to your complaints after that!
 ...This is... My cookiiiIIiiiiiing!!!!"


<Chie>
"...Ma-Maebara-kun... that's......?"

<Principal>
"Hmph...
 Onigiri, huh."
The judges smiled wryly at the simple fare that was quite in contrast to the preceding bravado.
Rena poured tea into the cups she had brought over from the break room.

<Satoko>
"He... he's making a mockery of this!!
 There... look!
 There's not even any filling... it's nothing more than salted onigiri!!!
 This isn't even worthy of being called a contest anymore!!!"

<Rena>
"......It's true, the amount of salt might be a little much, but..."
Rena's expression told me that she thought this was a great idea, but it might still not be enough to win the match...

<Tomita>
"Maebara-san, is this... really enough to make a comeback!?"

<Keiichi>
"Gentlemen.
 You did well.
 ...It's all right.
 Just watch."
The judges were chewing with their mouths full and sipping at the tea.
...Nobody was singing praises or awestruck.
...They were just quietly ...chowing down.

<Mion>
"......It seems that Kei-chan... has learned how to use some rather underhanded tricks.
 ...This... might be difficult."

<Rena>
"Yeah, that's right.
 ......Rena understands that now too."

<Satoko>
"Wh-What do you mean!?
 Why is everybody just quietly... eating that much!?"

<Rena>
"You see, Satoko-chan.
 That's because the judges are actually..."
...tired of eating curry!

Because they were judges, they had to sample each and every offering.
And because they were from small children, because they were made to show their appreciation, they couldn't eat just a little bit of each.

<Keiichi>
"Sometimes a man values the amount more than the taste!!
 At those times, rather than rich, mind-blowing flavor.... they crave simplicity!!"
They couldn't say it out loud, but this was the tastiest thing they'd had today...
 I confirmed that by looking at their eyes as the judges smiled wryly.

<Principal>
"I'll praise your efforts, but... today's contest was about curry.
 ...I'm not sure we can give a score to this."
The teacher and the principal had folded their arms while they pondered the situation.
My underlings, seeing that... saw the small glimmer of hope fade away, and grew dejected.
Argh, was this little surprise just not enough...?

<Mion>
"...Don't give up, Kei-chan."
Mion whispered quietly.
 ......That's right.
 If I didn't push here...!!!

<Keiichi>
"No.
 I'll have you give it a score.

<Keiichi>
If you think that curry and onigiri are really that different, you're sorely mistaken."

<Chie>
"Huh?
 Maebara-kun, what are you saying?
 How are they the same!?"
The principal stopped the teacher.
It looked like he was giving me one final chance.
The judges, having eaten their fill, quietly waited for my statement...

<Keiichi>
"In its homeland of India, curry is usually eaten with a type of bread called 'naan,' isn't it?
 Therefore, you could say that this cuisine we call curry rice, is something that we have adopted and modified.

<Keiichi>
Just as the teacher said at the beginning, it's a fusion of Indian and Japanese cuisine."

<Chie>
"I know what you're trying to say, Maebara-kun.
 But what does that have to do with onigiri...?"

<Keiichi>
"It's actually very simple.
 ...Both curry and onigiri...
 are things made to let you enjoy eating rice!!!!"

Rice was introduced to Japan from ancient China.
...Our agricultural forebears watered the fields, fighting the elements, disease, and pests to grow and raise our rice-centric culture...!!!
Yes, the Japanese people have formulated a plethora of dishes, but those were nothing more than attempts to find ways to enjoy eating rice!!!
 In other words...

<Keiichi>
"Curry and onigiri... are both the results of...
 Rice Culture!!!!!"

It was scattered at first, but slowly grew into a steady roar...
 It was a thunderous applause that praised me!

<Satoko>
"Enough with the nonsense already!!!!
 I won't accept this!!
 The teachers are only judging curry, you know!
 This is out of the question!
 It obviously deserves 0 points!!!"

<Rena>
"M-Miss... Keiichi-kun did his best.
 Could you please acknowledge that...?"

<Chie>
"...Today's class was supposed to be about curry...
 What should we do?"
Mion, stifling her laughter, stepped forward.

<Mion>
"There's a story about how when a famous chef from France came to Japan, the people from the hotel he was staying at had a whole bunch of ingredients imported from France.

<Mion>
But the chef didn't even give them a second glance."

<Rika>
"...I wonder why that was.
 They were ingredients from his homeland."

<Mion>
"The chef went to the local fishmarket, and made a dish from fresh fish caught in Japan.

<Mion>
The culture of food isn't bound by predetermined rules.
 ...It's culture. If you come to Japan, you meld with Japanese culture and make something new.

<Mion>
...That's how curry and onigiri are the same."
Mi-Mion...
 She was providing fire support... I had to be grateful.
The judges were somehow moved by this complicated-yet-baseless trivia.
A stern look washed over the teacher's face as she refolded her arms.

<Chie>
"...Maebara-kun, your pot of curry was flipped over, wasn't it?
 Even though I said at the beginning to be careful."

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm sorry..."

<Chie>
"But... as Maebara-kun and Sonozaki-san said, there are no boundaries in cuisine.
 If it's something that can amaze people, then it's not something that should be discriminated against just because of the form."

<Keiichi>
"...Then? Then?"

<Chie>
"For spilling your pot, minus 20 points.
 ...But, just for today...
 For not giving up, and doing your best, plus 20 points.
 I'll give you 100 points."

<Okamura>
""Ma-Maebara-san!! We did iiiiiIIIIiiiiiiIIIiiit!!!""
My underclassmen leapt at me!!
 A perfect score!!
 We did it! We did it!!
The curry was spilt and our rice was taken...
 But we made a comeback!!
In the end, Rika-chan's curry also received full marks, so everybody but Rena had a perfect score.
...Since this contest was outside the scope of regular club activities, there wasn't any particular penalty game.
 Rena breathed a sigh of relief.

<Keiichi>
"Now then, as promised. Satoko. Rika-chan.
 I'll be taking your curry."

<Satoko>
"Bu-Bu-But that means we won't have any lunch~! Wahhh~~!!!"
Satoko stomped angrily at the ground in frustration, but the price of defeat was absolute.

<Keiichi>
"--Is what I wanted to say, but I'll show you some mercy.
 You can eat half!!"

<Rika>
"...Thank you, Keiichi."
My two protégés peered over from the sidelines, tears of joy streaming from their faces. We exchanged glances that would only be understood amongst men.
We-We did it, Maebara-san!!
Aah, this is all thanks to you!!
We flashed each other a thumbs-up!

<Keiichi>
"Now... I just have to give these to my pupils.
 I've gotten pretty hungry myself.
 I guess I'll have one of my onigiri.
 ......Wai— huh?"
There was no trace of my onigiri.
The ones I had set aside for myself included.
As I peered around searching for them, the principal clapped a hand on my shoulder.

<Principal>
"Gahahaha!!
 When I was listening to that speech you gave, the rice I was chewing grew even more delicious!!
 Gahahahaha!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Ummm... could it be... that you also ate my share...?"

<Principal>
"Gahahahahahaha!!!"
The principal simply laughed without answering...
Se-Seriously...?
My eyes half-brimming with tears and my stomach rumbling, I was called over by the teacher.

<Chie>
"Maebara-kun, because of the circumstances, I had to give you a perfect score, but...
 You understand, right?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh? Understand... what?"
There was an odd glint in the teacher's eyes.
...If I had to describe it... it was curry-colored.
Like a pot of stewing curry, her eyes whirled around in a spiral.
 A chill washed over me.
The teacher clutched me by the shoulders, and drew me in closer until our noses were almost touching.

<Chie>
"Curry is this world's most respected and sacred of dishes.
 I will absolutely not allow it to be put in the same category as onigiri.
 You hear me?

<Satoko>
"...Hey, Keiichi-san!
 What are you stumbling around for!!
 Cleaning up is a part of cooking too!!"

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, your eyes are all curried!
 Why is that? Why?"
Curry curry curry.
 Hehehehe...♪

<Mion>
"Yikes... she got him, huh.
 It's okay, he'll be back to normal by tomorrow.
 Probably."
It wasn't that long before hunger brought me back to my senses.
In the end, all of the onigiri was eaten by the principal, so I had to make do without lunch.
Skipping lunch... I never knew the afternoon could be so long and painful...
A feeling other than drowsiness made me space out...

<Rena>
"A-Are you all right Keiichi-kun?
 That's why I said you shouldn't eat Rena's curry."
As if I could eat this curry with enough salt in it to make my blood pressure rise just by looking at it!
 Is what I said as I initially refused...
I could only regret it.
 ...The hunger... The stomachache...

<Mion>
"Well well!
 You did a good job making it through.
 Your absolutely hopeless situation, that is!
 Kei-chan, you're pretty strong when you're cornered, eh?"

<Keiichi>
"I don't need any compliments right now.
 ...I need food~..."

<Mion>
"There's something for you to eat at home, right?"

<Keiichi>
"We don't keep snacks lying around at home.
 And I'm out of cup noodles right now..."

<Mion>
"Ahahahaha!
 Since you're enduring that hunger so much right now, I'm sure tonight's dinner will be really tasty."
I had absolutely no intention of laughing along.

<Mion>
"Well then, I'll take my leave.
 I have my part-time job again today.
 ...*sigh* It's really rough when you're not used to the work."
Ah, that job at that Angel Mort family restaurant huh.
...That uniform(?) was somewhat stimulating...☆ Hau~.

<Keiichi>
"...Being a waitress really is hard work."

<Rena>
"Eh? Mii-chan is working as a waitress?
 Really!? Really!?
 What kind of place is it!? Hau~~!!"

<Mion>
"N-No... I'm... right, I'm working at that toy store from the other day!!
 Shion is the waitress..."
Ah, my bad.
I completely forgot that was how it ended up being...

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm sorry.
 You guys look so similar I mixed you up."

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun.
 ...Who's Shion?"
Rena asked the obvious question.

<Keiichi>
"Ah, ummm... Mion's younger twin sister.
 She's got a different personality, but she's a dead ringer for Mion."

<Mion>
"That's right!
 We look similar, but our personalities are completely different!
 I'm very kind and thoughtful, but Shion has a cold and scary personality...!"

<Keiichi>
"...I think that when you guys were born, Shion got all the feminine aspects.

<Keiichi>
Unlike Mion, she's a cute, cheerful girl."

<Mion>
"Ke-Ke-Kei-chaaaaAAaaan...!!!"
Rena interjected as her eyes darted back and forth from our exchange.

<Rena>
"...Hmmm?
 Is that true?
 Rena's never met her...
 Mii-chan, did you ever tell me you had a younger sister?"
Shion's existence was already being exposed as a cover-up.
...I-I couldn't help Mion out here...
 I could only have her end this charade.

<Mion>
"Oh yeah.
 I still haven't introduced her to you, Rena.
 Ahaha, my younger sister's name is Shion."

<Rena>
"I don't know.
 I've never heard of her.
 I never met her when I went to Mii-chan's house."

<Mion>
"Ummm... yeah, that!
 You know, I'm the only one that lives with granny.
 Shion lives at the family home in Okinomiya.
 We-We're not that close... so yeah, she doesn't come here too often~!"

<Rena>
"Hmmm..."
Rena's face indicated she wasn't sure if she was convinced.
She was usually a bit of an airhead, but she was unusually sharp when it came to these kinds of things...

<Keiichi>
"Ummm... well, ...it's not a lie. Please believe me."
As she said "Yeah, I believe you," a smile suddenly blossomed on Rena's face.

<Rena>
"Rena wants to meet her~!
 I'll go and see her some time!
 What store is she working at!? What store!?"

<Mion>
"Umm... ahh... that is..."
...Aaahh, she's getting more tangled in her little web.
 I could tell that Mion was getting increasingly frantic.
...I wanted to help her out, but it was hard for an outsider to butt in on family issues...

<Mion>
"Ah, ah! Sorry!!
 I have to get to work!!
 Later!
 Rena, Kei-chan!
 See you tomorrow~!!"
Unilaterally ending the conversation, Mion headed home...
No matter how you looked at it, she was running away...
 We'll just label this one as an emergency escape.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan was kinda cute.
 I wonder why, I wonder why.
 Hehe...!"
Rena giggled in amusement.
I wonder when dinner is...
 Would lying down be the best way to conserve energy?
I sprawled in the entryway without even taking off my shoes.
As I was losing the last vestiges of my consciousness, the doorbell rang.
 It seemed I had a guest.

<Keiichi>
"Come on in~.
 It's open..."
I directed my listless voice at the door.

<Shion>
"...G-Good afternoon... huh!?
 Kei-chan, what're you doing!?"
It seemed my guest was Mion, or rather, Shion.
She seemed shocked when she saw me sprawled out in the entryway.

<Keiichi>
"I-Is that Shion..!?
 Wait... why..."
I thought that Shion's existence was an illusion that was limited to when Mion was at the restaurant.
That's why I never even considered that Shion would appear here.

<Shion>
"I heard from my sister.
 Because of club activities today, you weren't able to eat lunch, right?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, it was a lot of trouble.
 Satoko spilled my pot, and you stole my rice..."

<Shion>
"Bu-But I'm... Shion..."
She grew red and began to mope.
 ...That's right, she was the younger twin right now.

<Keiichi>
"Sorry, sorry.
 ...What's up?
 Did you bring something for me to eat?"

<Shion>
"Oh my...
 ...It's somehow disappointing that you hit the nail right on the head, but here."
With a disappointed smile, Shion held out the small bento box she had hidden behind her back.

<Keiichi>
"Huh!?
 Y-You really brought something to eat!?
 Th-Thanks!"

<Shion>
"There was still some of the ground beef left over from what my sister brought to school.
 I knew it was going to be right before dinner... but I wondered if you'd want it.
 Am I bothering you?"

<Keiichi>
"N-Not even a bit...!
 I'm really happy!!
 Can I really eat this!?"
Sneaking a look inside the box, to say that she just put some of the leftovers inside would have been a lie. There was an elegant meal stuffed inside.

<Keiichi>
"I-Is it really okay!?
 There's not like a ton of hot sauce mixed in or anything, right!?"

<Shion>
"Geez.
 I'm not my sister. I wouldn't do that kind of thing.
 If you don't like it you don't have to force yourself...
 I'll just go home and eat it myself."
Saying that, she pouted cutely and made a motion as if to snatch the box back.
...There were some times that made me doubt that she was the same person as Mion, and this was undoubtedly one of those moments.

<Keiichi>
"I-I don't mind at all.
 I want to chow down on it with thanks from the bottom of my heart...!"

<Shion>
"I-It's... not something to be so thankful about that your nose has to run..."
Shion, who had thought that I might not take the bento, looked down happily.

<Keiichi>
"Th-There's not much, but do you want to come in...?
 I can probably make some tea or something..."

<Shion>
"...Ahh... sorry, maybe some other time.
 I'm on my way to work."
Oh, that's right.
 She did say that before...

<Shion>
"Just rinse the box out with water and give it back to my sister tomorrow, please."

<Keiichi>
"O-Of course!
 It would only be the proper thing to do after being allowed to eat something that looks this delicious!"

<Shion>
"Well then, I'll take my leave.
 .........Ah...
 ...One last thing..."
Shion grew red again as she looked down once more.

<Shion>
"...During that contest with the curry, my sister took your rice without permission, right?
 ...My sister fools around too much, so sometimes she gets carried away.
 She wasn't doing it just to be mean..."

<Keiichi>
"Hey, hey.
 It's not like I mind that too much.
 There are no grudges when it comes to club activities, after all!

<Keiichi>
In fact, I should be the one that's thankful for all the thrills and entertainment!
 ...
Could you tell that to Mion for me?"

<Shion>
"...Yes.
 ...I think
 ...my sister will be very happy to hear that.
 Well then, I have to go...!"
Shion smiled brightly.
After bowing deeply, she left as she looked at her watch.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm happy... but... is this really okay?"
I looked at the bento box that she left behind.
A faint warmth spread through the palm of my hand.
If it were Mion... I could see hot sauce, mustard, maybe even a needle being mixed inside. (But really, I don't think she would go so far as putting a needle in there...)
I opened the box once again, and hesitantly tasted a bit.
...I took a bite.
 And another.
...There was no funny business.
...There was no danger at all, for it was delicious.
That's right.
 That was Shion, not Mion. So there shouldn't have been anything to worry about.
I rushed back to my room, eating as I gave my thanks.
...It was so delicious that my stomach could cry.

<Keiichi>
"...Shion,
 ...No... Mion,
 when she heard I was so hungry I could die, she brought this over to me."
It was delicious to the last bite.
 ...By the way, nothing strange had been mixed in.
I was a bit embarrassed at myself for being so skeptical.



[Watanagashi Ch.4]

I might have explained this before, but...
Phys Ed at our school is really just an exercise in disorder.
After some random warm-ups, the rest of the time is spent doing whatever.
 You're free to cause a ruckus or just fall asleep.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm not really sure, but doesn't the Board of Education have some sort of curriculum for this?
 Something like: 'When you're this old, you should have this amount of physical ability'?"

<Satoko>
"I have no idea what you're saying, Keiichi-san; it's rather difficult to understand."

<Rena>
"Well, you see.
 It's something like a rule for teachers to follow during class."

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!
 Maybe you weakling city-folk need something like that.
 But do you really think us country-raised kids would lag behind in physical ability?"

<Rika>
"...We're better athletes than you would think, Keiichi."
Come to think of it... they might be right.
If we all lined up for a race, there was a good chance I'd finish dead last if I didn't start off well.
...Let's just pray that when a brutal penalty game is at stake, the 100m dash isn't a club activity.

<Keiichi>
"On that note... I watched too much television so I'm fantastically tired.
 I'll be using this time to catch up on my sleep.
 It's 4th period and I'm completely starved.
 ...If I don't sleep now, when will I ever?"
As I began to sprawl out on top of a pipe, Mion grabbed me by the collar.

<Mion>
"Tsk tsk tsk.
 Do you really think I'd let you sleep in peace and quiet~?"

<Keiichi>
"...With that look on your face, it'd require more courage to try and take a nap than not."
Good grief...
 Which means... is it going to start again...!?

<Mion>
"Now!!
 Just killing time with idle chit-chat until the bell rings is impossible for us hot-blooded youth, isn't it?
 Shall we start a club activity!?"

<Keiichi>
"Hmph, just as I thought, it's come to this.
 What's today's game!?"
Now that this is happening, taking a nap is impossible.
Not just that... with this sleep-deprived head of mine, I'm as good as mincemeat!
I have to get my brain into gear!!

<Rena>
"Rena thinks that we should decide what today's penalty game should be before we start."

<Mion>
"Hehehe...
 Rena knows what's up~!
 I've prepared something super special today!"
She began to announce the cruel penalty game with a grand spinning flourish!
 But before she could do that—

<Rika>
"...I'm sorry.
 I have something that I wanted to do."
Of all people, it was Rika-chan announcing her non-participation.
 Even rare events do eventually occur.
...Losing her timing, Mion spun like a top as she tumbled to the ground.

<Mion>
"Whaaaaa...
 ...Huh? What's the matter?
 Are you not feeling well?"

<Rena>
"Oh, that's right.
 Mii-chan, she has to practice for the Watanagashi."

<Satoko>
"That's right.
 It's this Sunday.
 Rika is in the middle of super serious training right now!!"

<Rika>
"I've been working too hard lately, so my arms hurt."

<Mion>
"I see.
 Well, there's nothing that can be done.
 There's no point in doing anything if we can't get everybody together.
 ...Today, let's just take it easy!"

<Rika>
"...I'm very sorry.
 But I'll try my best."

<Rena>
"Yeah! Good luck!
 We'll be cheering you on~!"
When Mion announced that today's club activity was cancelled, Rika-chan and Satoko headed off behind the school building.
Only I was left alone, completely clueless as to what everybody was talking about.

<Keiichi>
"...What was that about?
 Is Rika-chan training for a competition or something??"

<Mion>
"Huh?
 Didn't you get the notice at your house, Kei-chan?
 Wasn't it written there?
 The Watanagashi Festival is this Sunday."

<Keiichi>
"You guys did tell me about the festival before. That's right, Rika-chan is on the festival committee, isn't she? Does it have something to do with that?"

<Rena>
"Rika-chan is a shrine maiden for the Watanagashi, so she has to perform a ritual dance. 

<Rena>
It's practice for that."
...Huh?
Come to think of it, I have a feeling Mom did say something about it during dinner the other day.
 So, Rika-chan plays the part of a shrine maiden?

<Keiichi>
"I see, Mom did say that futons, padded cloaks and stuff are made as offerings. ...So, does that mean the cotton stuffing gets pulled out during a dance or something?"

<Mion>
"Oh, I figured you might guess right, Kei-chan!
 The Watanagashi --or Cotton Drift-- Festival is, as the name implies, where we set cotton adrift down the river."

<Rena>
"They also pile futons up on the altar.
 The Watanagashi is a festival that happens at the shrine on a Sunday every June.
 It's very lively!"
Mion and Rena nodded back at me, looking a bit impressed.
 It seemed that my observations were on mark.
 Although, when I first heard about it, I imagined piling futons up in the swamp.
 ...but that'd block the river, and be a real pain to clear up after.

<Keiichi>
"I've heard of people leaving offerings of things like needles or kitchen knives to their ancestors or to casualties of war...
 But an offering of futons is a first for me.
 What's the history behind that?"
Mion tilted her head pensively.

<Mion>
"I don't think there's a complicated backstory to it.
 The winters around here are pretty harsh, so things like warm futons and coats to ward off the cold are fairly important, I guess."

<Keiichi>
"Ah, I see.
 In other words, it's something like giving thanks to the futons that took care of you during the winter, then.
 Then, the shrine maiden holds a memorial service for them and set them adrift. 

<Keiichi>
That's what the Watanagashi is?"
Mion and Rena indicated that I had the correct answer with a round of applause.

<Rena>
"And you see, and you see.
 That shrine maiden performing the memorial is... Rika-chan!"

<Keiichi>
"Oh?
 So Rika-chan is a shrine maiden.
 ...Now that you mention it, Rika-chan does have a mystical air about her."

<Rena>
"Right? Right!
 Rika-chan in a shrine maiden outfit... hau~!
 Sho kyuuute!"
...It certainly does seem like it would suit her.
 Yeah, it might be kyute.

<Keiichi>
"I finally get what you're saying.
 Rika-chan's training is for her performance as a shrine maiden then."

<Mion>
"That would be it.
 The shrine maiden has to purify a number of futons as part of the ceremony.
 It's practice for that.
 ...It's a lot of hard work."

<Rena>
"The shrine maiden has to carry a large ceremonial hoe as part of the rite... and it's really heavy for Rika-chan."

<Keiichi>
"Well, Rika-chan is pretty small.
 ...Exactly how heavy is that hoe?"

<Rena>
"It's pretty heavy.
 ...Enough that Rika-chan has been practicing with a mochi mallet."
Wait a minute.
 That's way too heavy!!
Forget about Rika-chan, that'd be rough even for me!

<Rena>
"It's a sacred ceremonial hoe...
 If she dropped it by accident, it'd be big trouble."

<Mion>
"Well... it's a once-a-year kind of deal.
 All we can do is cheer from the sidelines.
 ...It'll be okay.
 She pulled it off last year!"

<Keiichi>
"...Really?
 Then the least I can do is cheer her on!!
 Even something that little would help, right?"
I was rather curious about exactly how she practiced.
Mion laughed as she shook her head.

<Mion>
"Leave her alone.
 If you go, Rika-chan will get all cute and won't be able to practice."
Hm?
 I didn't quite understand what Mion was saying.

<Rena>
"You see, Rika-chan doesn't like showing people how hard she works.
 Okay?
 So just leave her be."
...Even the always cool and aloof Rika-chan has times when she sweats while giving it her all.
Because she was always so well put together, she didn't want people to see an ungainly side of her... It's not like I couldn't understand that feeling.

<Keiichi>
"All I can do is pray for her success, huh.
 ...Do your best!!
 Rika Furude~!!
 I'm cheering for you~!!!"
Well then.
I climbed up onto the pipe, and plopped down on my side.

<Keiichi>
"Hooray! Hooray! Riiikaa-chaaaaaan.
 ...In order to transmit more of my psychic waves of encouragement, I'll be entering a meditative state now.
 ...zzzzzzz."

<Mion>
"So you're just going to sleep after all!?!?"
The lackadaisical noontime ended up giving way to mind-numbing afternoon classes.
Rebounding from yesterday's hunger, I ate too much for lunch today, leaving me in a horrible condition.

<Keiichi>
"Ugh... I might have gorged myself a bit too much...
 I'll... have to endure afternoon classes..."

<Rena>
"Ahahaha.
 Keiichi-kun, you had an amazing appetite today!"

<Mion>
"Basically, you always eat like a pig.
 But today was on a whole different level."

<Keiichi>
"Yesterday I skipped lunch, right?
 That hunger just soaked right in.
 This time, no matter how much I ate, my hunger knew no bounds..."

<Mion>
"Ahahaha, I get you. I get you."

<Mion>
"But really... Kei-chan, you always finish your lunch down to the last bite.
 Heck, even down to the last grain of rice."

<Keiichi>
"With food, you show your appreciation for the person who made it by eating it, you know.
 If you leave any behind, it's rude to the person who put in all that effort."
Hearing that, Mion's eyes momentarily widened in surprise, followed by a cool laugh.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, really.
 At first glance, you seem unruly and irresponsible, but you're actually pretty conscientious.
 Well-disciplined, or something like that."

<Rena>
"Ah, yeah. Rena thinks so too. Thinks so too!
 Keiichi-kun is a lot kinder than he looks!"
...Both of them were probably trying to compliment me, but I had a strange feeling I wasn't being complimented at all.

<Mion>
"That's not true!
 I just wanted to say that there's a big gap between your appearance and your personality."

<Keiichi>
"And I'm saying that's not a compliment!"

<Chie>
"Hey!
 Sonozaki-san! Maebara-kun! We're in the middle of class!
 How far did you get, Sonozaki-san? Bring your notes up here."
Startled, Mion vocalized a rather easy to understand utterance.
She was so enthralled in the conversation, she had stopped working completely.

<Mion>
"Ummm... Uhh....
 Doing all right...☆"

<Chie>
"You haven't progressed at all!!
 You're in the highest grade, so you have to shape up!!"
That Mion, it looks like she's getting lectured.
 Poor bastard.

<Rena>
"Appearances can be deceiving, in other words.
 ...Actually, appearance might be the opposite of reality."

<Keiichi>
"...Hmmm? You say some interesting things."
Responding to Rena's seemingly profound statement, I turned my gaze to where Satoko was happily studying together with Rika-chan.

<Keiichi>
"Are you saying that brat Satoko is actually really meek?"
If I went by what Rena literally said, then that would be the case.
I could hardly imagine Satoko being meek and gentle like a girl in some fairy tale.

<Rena>
"Satoko-chan's been rude lately, but just a while ago she was pretty different.
 She acted really spoiled and always--
 ...
 Yup.
 Ehehe... keep this a secret from Satoko-chan, okay☆?"

<Keiichi>
"That Satoko... acting so cute!?"
For Satoko to play coy, I think that would have to be some part of some calculated plot.
Even if she was to hide behind someone, I wouldn't think it was because she was attached to them.
...But since it came up, I tried to imagine a gentle and coquettish Satoko.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Satoko."

<Satoko>
"What is it, onii-sama☆?"
Satoko smiled cutely, and walked towards me...
By the way, for every three steps forward Satoko took, for some reason I took three steps away.

<Satoko>
"Hm?
 Onii-sama, why are you running away...?"

<Keiichi>
"Sorry, Satoko.
 ...For you to approach me with an affectionate smile on your face, I just have to think it's some sort of trap."

<Satoko>
"Th-That's so mean!
 Onii-sama you meanie~!
 Waaaaaaaa~~!!!!"

<Keiichi>
"A-Ah...So-So-Sorry!! I didn't intend to be so mean!"
The weeping Satoko came closer to me...
 ...I'm a sucker for tears...
*click*
 *CLANK*

Huh!?
A bear trap!?!?
My leg was being clamped down on by jagged metal teeth!

<Satoko>
"Ohohoho!!
 You fell for it!!
 Now for the next part!!"
Satoko raised her right arm triumphantly... and traps began to trigger one after another!!
Suddenly, the wall sprang forward, throwing me three blocks away!
And there I saw... a giant metal ball covered in spikes, hurtling towards me!!!!
On top of that, in the direction the ball would knock me was a giant guillotine!!!!

<Rena>
"I'm not really sure, but Keiichi-kun... you're not thinking of anything completely ludicrous right now, are you?"

<Keiichi>
"Not really.
 Not at all..."

<Rena>
"That's a lie.
 You've got the kind of look on your face that says: 'I'm gonna be crushed by a giant spiked metal ball~!'"
...How could my expression convey what I was thinking like that?

<Keiichi>
"Sorry.
 ...Imagining a meek and gentle Satoko is impossible right now.
 ...I'll try again when I'm in better shape..."
Next, I looked over at Rika-chan, who was working diligently on some kanji drills.
In contrast to Satoko, her default state was meek and gentle.
If Rika-chan came at me saying "Onii-sama~☆," I'd hug her.
 Tightly.
 I could get used to that!!

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, you're drooling."

<Keiichi>
"Ah, sorry, sorry.
 ...Then, how about Rika-chan?
 Are you saying that her appearance is deceiving as well?"
Saying that out loud, I felt a tinge of doubt.
...Was Rika-chan really all sweet??
Despite her appearance... she really was quite sly. Sweetly... how do you put it... evading things deftly?

<Keiichi>
"...I get the feeling that Rika-chan isn't only just sweet.
 ...Her appearance is definitely deceiving."
I couldn't put exactly what I was imagining into words, but Rena managed to say what I wanted to.
She turned to me with an impish look in her eyes, like she was saying: "Ahh, you shouldn't say something like that~"

<Rena>
"When Rika-chan grows up, I'm sure she'll become an incredibly devilish beauty, with men wrapped all around her little finger.
 Don't you think that would be cool?"
Rena said that lightheartedly... but I, as a man, couldn't laugh at that.
The scary part about that was that it felt like it could be true.
Noticing my gaze, Rika-chan turned towards me and let loose with an angelic smile.
Both Rena and I, feeling as if that was directed towards us personally, had our hearts skip a beat.

<Rena>
"Hau~~... Sho kyu-kyu-kyuuuuute. Sho kyuuuuute☆"

<Keiichi>
"Rena, your nose is bleeding."
...Appearances can be deceiving, huh.
 ...Well then, what about our Dear Leader, Mion?
I stared at her as she tried to weasel her way out of her scolding by the teacher.
By Rena's theory, that unrefined, calculating, conniving Mion also had a side of her that belied appearances.
 ...

<Keiichi>
"Then what you're saying is: 'That Mion, despite her appearance, is actually a good person'?"

<Rena>
"Mii-chan *is* a good person."

<Keiichi>
"Oh, well, that *is* true!
 But what I'm trying to say is..."

<Rena>
"Yup yup~. I know what you're trying to say, Keiichi-kun."
Catching on that I was struggling to express my feelings as words, Rena smiled even more brightly.

<Keiichi>
"Know what?"

<Rena>
"Mii-chan is mysterious, right?
 She's a girl, but it's like she's a guy."
That's right.
 Mion was more than aware that she was a girl, but it was exactly as Rena said.
When Mion livened up the mood, it wasn't as though she felt like a guy or a girl specifically, but a friend of the same gender.

<Keiichi>
"If she were a guy... we'd probably be like two peas in a pod.
 ...Although, that's the same way it is right now. Ahaha!"

<Rena>
"But you see.
 Even that Mii-chan...
 is actually really feminine."

<Keiichi>
"...Rena.
 How much did Mion pay you exactly?"

<Rena>
"Thaat's noooot trueee~!
 Geez, I'm trying to have a serious conversation, you know? You know?"
Rena began to pout. Now probably wasn't the right time to joke around.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan is the club president, so she's trying hard to lead everybody.
 But she's really a very cute girl.
 I really don't want you to forget that, Keiichi-kun..."
...Rena's gaze focused off into the distance, beyond where Mion was.
The Mion that I met at Angel Mort was unimaginably different compared to the Mion that I normally knew.
Flustered and hesitant from the unfamiliar job.
 It was a far cry from the brash and confident Mion.
Even though she had to hurry to work, she went through all the trouble to bring me food when I was on the brink of starvation.
 And she did so not as Mion, but as Shion.
What exactly was Shion to Mion?
 What kind of person was Mion exactly?

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun probably couldn't even begin to imagine. Begin to imagine! ...Hehehe!"
As if to say it was our little secret, Rena held her finger up to her lips as she giggled.
Mion—finally free from the teacher's preaching—returned to her seat, cradling her head to hide her embarrassment.

<Mion>
"Hmph!
 This old man, you see, thinks that grade school is enough for everything you need to study for in life."
Saying that, she plopped down into her seat violently.
Mion was actually really feminine. Right.
I wonder if I can meet Shion again.
...I wanted to talk to her again.
*CLANG CLANG*
The principal waved around the bell that served as the school chime.
The teacher rushed back to the black board and began to list everybody's homework assignments.

<Rena>
"Whoa.
 It looks like there's gonna be a lot of homework today. Gotta buckle down!"

<Keiichi>
"Well then.
 ...That means, even Rena?"

<Rena>
"Huh? What do you mean?"

<Keiichi>
"Appearances can be deceiving.
 Would that apply to you too?"

<Rena>
"Huh?
 Ahahahaha...
 Keiichi-kun... how do you see me?
 How? How?"
The Rena Ryuugu that I knew... sometimes took things too far, but was generally a kind and gentle, ideal girl.

<Rena>
"Really? Really...?
 Then... that m-m-makes... me happy I guess..."
If she was the opposite of what she seemed, that would make her...

<Keiichi>
"...and if you were really the opposite...?"

<Rena>
"..."
Just try saying it, I won't be mad.
 ...That's what I felt she meant.

<Keiichi>
"...Rena is..."

<Rena>
"Uh-huh. Rena is...?"

<Keiichi>
"E-
 ...Even if you were the opposite, you'd still be Rena.
 ...Right?"
This question shouldn't have been so nerve-wracking to answer.
...Maybe it was because the person in question was staring at me, but...
Even saying that took a strange amount of effort.

<Rena>
"Th-That's no fair, Keiichi-kun.
 It bothers me when you say it that way~ ...Hau!!"
Perhaps unable to endure my silence, Rena's face began to burn red with embarrassment.

<Mion>
"Rena~!!
 Kei-cha~n!!
 Let's go home!!"
Mion walked over and started getting ready to go home.
Whenever school is over, she really does get noticeably more energetic.
It was the same relaxing walk home as always.
Digging around my pocket on a whim, I noticed something that should have been there was missing.

<Mion>
"What's the matter, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"...The key to my house I always carry around is gone.
 ...Man, where did I lose it?
 It's fine today since my parents are home, but still, this is bad."

<Rena>
"That sure is troublesome...
 Did you forget it somewhere?
 Or did you drop it?"
Which one was it?
Did I take it with me this morning in the first place?
 ...Huh? Huh?

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, did that key have anything that would make it stand out?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, it's on a keychain.
 It was a blue fur seal, something I made for summer homework a long time ago."

<Mion>
"Huh? ...Does it have its eyes shut, like it's taking a nap?"

<Keiichi>
"Oh, how did you know?
 Yeah, yeah, that's it!"
Mion looked away and began to whistle.

<Mion>
"Ummm... see.
 You went for dinner at Angel Mort a couple of days ago, right?
 That night, the staff found a key...
 And there was a fur seal keychain attached to it."
As she said that, she suddenly grew flustered, and added that Shion had told her about it.

<Keiichi>
"Huh!?
 So, I dropped it then..."

<Rena>
"Ahahaha, but aren't you glad they found it?
 I'm sure they're looking after it for you."

<Mion>
"That's right.
 Why don't you go?
 Shion looks the same as me, so you'll know her by sight."
This was... a rather unexpected development.
 ...Once again, I had no choice but to go and meet with Shion...
But I also had to thank her for the bento from yesterday.
Besides, taking some time and chatting with this other side of Mion might be interesting... Half-jokingly, I began to think about things like this.

<Keiichi>
"Right.
 Angel Mort, was it? I'll head over to Shion's restaurant and get my key back.
 While I'm at it, having a nice spot of tea might not be a bad idea."

<Mion>
"Ahahahaha!
 You sound like an English gentleman.
 That totally doesn't suit you, Kei-chan!"

<Rena>
"Is this the restaurant?
 The one that Mii-chan's little sister is working at?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah. Why don't we go together, Rena?"

<Rena>
"Sorry to disappoint you... but I have plans with my father today.
 Some other time."
Rena seemed pretty disappointed about having to miss such a great opportunity.

<Rena>
"You said they're twins, but do they really look that much alike?
 Enough to mistake which is which?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, they're totally the same.
 At least on the outside.
 ...Unlike Mion, she's well-mannered and really cute, though..."
In response to my teasing, Mion pouted and began to argue with me.
...I couldn't help but burst out laughing at Mion's little farce.
After all, they weren't just identical, they were the same person.
After going home, I changed my clothes and dug my bike out of the garage.
Just thinking that I would be able to meet Shion again gave me a mysterious feeling.
Shion, a name for a different kind of Mion.
...She was a mysterious and ridiculous person, believing she had fooled everyone like that.
I noticed that I was pedaling along quite happily.
Could it be that I was looking forward to meeting Shion?
I felt a sense of giddy anticipation, like I was headed towards a new friend's house for the first time.
What Rena said about Mion actually being really feminine sprang to mind once again.
The guilt from spying on another side of Mion, the self-consciousness from being the only one that knew about that side, these feelings mixed together.
That was Shion for you.
 Mion's little twin sister.
...Until she felt like coming out and admitting she was Mion, it was fine to just call her Shion, right?
Mion might be trying to have some fun by acting out a different persona.
As I reached the top of the steep hill, the horizon expanded before me. I was almost at the station.
The last time I wasn't embarrassed since I was here with Dad, but this time I was alone... I was strangely self-conscious about it.
Meet Shion, get my key back.
 That was all this task was supposed to be...
If I dawdled around like this, maybe Shion would find me before she headed in for work.
...Hey, hey! What are you doing, Keiichi Maebara!
You're just here to get your key back, you know?
It's not like you're some love-struck schoolboy here to hand over a love letter!
Aahhh... the thoughts inside my head were slowly turning into a jumbled mess...
I came to the realization that I was downright giddy.
That's why... for just a bit...
Just a tiny little bit...
...I got a little carried away and did something really stupid.
I kicked over a parked motorcycle that was blocking the sidewalk.
It was in the way, sure, but there was absolutely no need for me to kick it.
 ...I definitely think I got too carried away.
*thunk, clack*
 *CRASH!!*
As the three bikes toppled one after another like dominos, the loud noise they caused snapped me back to my senses.

<Keiichi>
"...Oh ...Shi--"

<Delinquent>
"The hell you think yer doin'!!!"
...The owners of those three bikes were right there.
They looked exactly like what you'd call 'thugs up to no good.'
They lifted their heads up in an imposing manner, and yelled angrily in a way I had never heard before.
The three of them beelined towards me, the worn-down heels of their thin-soled shoes slapping noisily against the pavement. I could only stare listlessly, as if I were watching some far-off event that didn't concern me at all.
By the time I realized it, I had been grabbed by the collar and lifted onto my tip-toes.

<Delinquent>
"Dun be playin' dumb!!
 Ye knockt em ova didntcha!?
 HuuuUUUhhhh!?"
The three thugs were completely ignoring the rules of grammar, but the way they spoke was enough to make me tremble.
...Just like that, my composure drained away... my legs buckled and my throat grew dry enough to crack.

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm s-sorry... I a-accidentally--"

<Delinquent>
"Axident my ass!
 Ye kickt it didntcha dumbass!!"
I was completely at fault, so there was nothing I could say in my defense.
...As a result I was pulled even higher...

<Delinquent>
"Da hell man!!
 Da paint's all scuffed!!!"

<Delinquent>
"Yo, brat!!
 Who putchu upta dis eh!?"

<Delinquent>
"Dis iz yer gerdam fault!!"
The three of them continued to yell at me. I had no idea what each of them were saying.
Getting further enraged that I was only listening while dumbstruck, they grabbed an empty plastic crate from a nearby store and began to smash it repeatedly against a telephone pole.
Cracks formed in the crate, plastic shards flying everywhere.
 They then slammed it full-force into the shuttered storefront.
*SMASH*

The shutter let out a frighteningly loud noise.
Still not satisfied, they flipped over a case of empty cans, scattering its contents all over the place.
...Th-This was not normal...
It was something you saw often on television or in manga, but I never thought seeing it in person would be this terrifying...
I became painfully aware that the safety of civilized society was only held up by such a frail concept as morals.
My knees clattered together noisily.
 Static began to pepper my vision...
This is what you would call... absolute terror.
There was nothing I could do to stop this frightening spectacle of violence.
I could only pray for help...
...The fear I felt was just too much...
Would somebody... help me?
 My gaze floundered about the surrounding area.
I was surrounded by these three hoodlums.
No way would there be a passerby brave enough to intervene.
Maybe this was what you call... reaping what you sow.
...If I were a passerby... there would be no doubt that I'd ignore what was going on.
So this was somewhat of a cosmic retribution...

<Delinquent>
"Fookin' say sumtin!!!
 I'll fookin' stab ye!!!"
Angry yelling loud enough to rattle my eardrums spewed forth right in front of my face.
My waning consciousness was forcefully dragged back to the forefront.
The thug had cocked back his free hand and twisted his body, when suddenly, a metallic taste filtered through the back of my throat.
A chill ran down my spine like a jolt of electricity.
...Seeing what was going to happen next, I squeezed my eyes shut as tightly as possible and grit my teeth!!!

<Shion>
"You're making quite the racket, you stupid pieces of trash...
 Get out of my sight."
...That voice was a short distance away.
Still holding me by the collar, the three thugs spun around to look behind them.

<Delinquent>
"Dafuq ye say!!!"
Standing there was Shion.
 ...I mean, Mion.
 ...She stood there, displaying an imposing stature that I'd never seen before.
She didn't have the same look on her face as she did when we were playing around during club.
...Those were the eyes that would instill fear in anyone who looked upon them: the eyes of a raptor.
...They were the epitome of terror...
 At the same time, they were the most reassuring things in the world.

<Shion>
"I'll only say this one more time.
 ...Let go of Kei-chan and get lost."
Mion, without an ounce of fear, laid down her ultimatum.
Of course there was no way those three wouldn't go absolutely berserk.
The situation instantly turned explosively dangerous...

<Delinquent>
"Ye fookin biiiiitch!!
 I'll fookin bash yer ead in!!"
Stop it, Mion... these guys are like rabid dogs!
 No amount of bluffing will work!

<Keiichi>
"...Mi-Mion...
 It's dangerous...
 So ru—"
I knew what I was saying was pathetic.
 ...But... I couldn't let Mion get involved in this!
No matter how you looked at it, Mion was only bluffing.
...But, did Mion even know the meaning of the word "bluff"?
However... the reason behind everything soon became apparent.
...They were slowly increasing in number. Little by little.
At first, it was only businessmen on their way home stopping to take a look.
Then, it was housewives in the middle of shopping taking a gander.
...Next, what seemed like the owner of some store showed up... and it was pretty clear he wasn't just looking.
Around Mion... there was already about seven people gathered.
It felt different than people coming out to support a friend.
...If I had to say why, it was because the group that gathered was diverse in age and gender.
The three thugs seemed to slowly realize that there was something strange about the situation.

<Delinquent>
"Who da hell are deez guys!!"
Behind them, at some point four more people of differing clothes and ages had gathered.
A girl who looked to be in middle school.
A man wearing a bakery apron.
An old lady in a house-cleaning smock.
More and more... people of various ages.
Their gazes, comparable to Mion's, were of hostility.
 Of intimidation.
Before I realized it, over ten people had formed a ring around us.
At that moment, five elementary schoolers ran in and joined the circle.
...There were some familiar faces.
 Some of our classmates.
...Then these people were... residents of Hinamizawa!?
More and more people from Hinamizawa gathered around.
...In obvious contrast, the residents of Okinomiya were passing by as quickly as possible.

<Delinquent>
"Dafuq are you guys?
 Go dafuq away!!"
The group surrounding us had suddenly swelled to around twenty people.
...Completely encircled, the faces of the thugs began to show the first signs of panic...
Nobody spoke a word, Mion included.
That made everything completely unnatural, and depending on which side you were on, completely terrifying.
...Only the thugs voices echoed out like they were screaming.
Somebody took a step forward, closing the gap between them.
...As they did, everybody else took a step forward, shrinking the circle.
The hoodlums went pale as they were pushed together, back-to-back, while still yelling angrily.
They were trying to string together vulgarities, but for some reason it sounded like they were crying out for help...

<Policeman>
"All right, all right, all right, what's going on here? What's going on!?"
It was sudden.
 A solidly-built officer cut his way through the crowd.
At some point two police cars had arrived.
 Some passerby had undoubtedly called for them.
Several burly officers appeared from inside the 2nd vehicle.

<Shion>
"...Oh, Officer, good timing!
 There you go, the extortionists, caught red handed.
 Please arrest them."

<Delinquent>
"Dafuq!?
 Dis brat's da one dat's wrong here!!"
Mion, returning to her usual self, was nonchalantly pointing out the hoodlums to the police.
Of course the thugs were furious.
But, now that it had come to this, there was nothing they could do.
It was their loss.

<Policeman>
"Okay, okay!!
 Come over here for a sec.
 Come on already!!"
The officers handcuffed the thugs and dragged them towards the patrol cars.

<Delinquent>
"Dafuq, lemme go!!
 We're da victims here, are you listenin' dammit!!"
No matter how much of a ruckus they caused, the officers paid no heed.
In the blink of an eye, they were crammed inside the two vehicles.
They could still be heard yelling while inside the police cars, but what they were saying was no longer intelligible.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Are you all right?
 Are you injured?"
He was probably a detective.
 The man leading the police peered at my face.

<Keiichi>
"...No... not really."

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Nfu-fu-fu-fu!
 Well, that's a bit of a silver lining then.
 Well then, have a good year."
The portly man, after taking a quick look around, addressed the crowd.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Thank you, citizens, for your timely report.
 Thanks to your efforts, we were able to keep the peace today.
 It's a wonderful thing.
 ...Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"

<Shion>
"...Thank you for your hard work,
 Detective Ooishi.
 As a citizen, I thank you for your daily efforts.

<Shion>
It's an honor for a detective from the first division to come out all this way."
...The way Shion talked didn't have a very pleasant tone.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"It was a coincidence.
 I happened to hear the call over the radio on my way back from the prefectural office.
 I just made a little detour."

<Shion>
"Please keep up the good work.
 I pray for success in your future endeavors."

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Nfu-fu-fu-fu!
 Aww shucks.
 It's a good thing there were no injuries, though."

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-sa~n!
 We're done here!
 Let's go!"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Well then, have a good year.
 ...I'm sorry, could you make way?"
The detective named Ooishi, after jovially making pleasantries, lumbered over to the waiting police car.
It quickly set off, disappearing down the city street.
It was over so quickly.
...So quickly, I was dumbstruck.
I didn't even get to ask the officer what was going on.
...It was like they came here quickly to disperse the mob before any trouble could start.
After making sure the police cars had left, Mion snapped her fingers sharply.

<Shion>
"All right! That's a wrap!!
 And don't come back!"
That was the signal.
 The tension melted away in an instant as everybody began smiling.
A middle-aged man helped me up.

<Man>
"Are you okay, young Maebara?
 Next time pick your fights a bit better~."

<Keiichi>
"I-It's not like I wanted to fight..."

<Woman>
"Are you hurt anywhere?
 If you hit your head it would be a good idea to get an X-ray taken."
An older lady I didn't know the name of was concerned about my injury.

<Woman>
"You were lucky this happened right in front of the station when it was busy, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to gather as many people.
 Next time, be more careful!
 City kids these days are pretty unruly! 

<Woman>
*sigh*... honestly!"
I was even warned by the old lady in the smock.
As Shion finished applauding the dispersing group for their efforts, she strode over to me.

<Shion>
"Well well... you're pretty good, Kei-chan.
 But I also think you should be more careful about who you pick a fight with~."

<Keiichi>
"Th-Thanks, Mion...
 ...you saved my bacon there."

<Shion>
"...Like I said, I'm Shion..."
She made a troubled expression as she turned her gaze downward, blushing in embarrassment.

<Shion>
"I heard from my sister.
 That fur seal keychain was yours, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"Oh... yeah, that's right.
 ...I was just heading to the restaurant."

<Shion>
"And you ended up feeling so excited that you got mixed up in something weird?"
Now it was my turn for my face to go red.
I... didn't want to admit... that she was spot on.

<Keiichi>
"Well... I was just unlucky.
 But you really saved me, Shion."

<Shion>
"You don't have to thank me.
 So, if you see somebody else getting bullied, help them out, okay?
 ...We value that kind of thing very highly here."
I was well-versed in that sense of camaraderie.
...But, the way I was rescued just now... something seemed a little off about that.
While I was helped out, it was honestly to an almost disturbing degree...

<Shion>
"...You're coming into the restaurant, right?
 You must be tired, so why don't you relax for a bit?
 My treat."
...Seems that she caught the glimmer of suspicion in my eyes.
Without waiting for my answer, Shion began walking.
After cooling off a bit inside the restaurant, little by little, I realized I was still on edge.
There were spots here and there on my body that hurt, probably because I had been so stiff with nervousness.
Shion, who had changed into her uniform, brought over two glasses of iced coffee.

<Shion>
"Here you go. Iced coffee, on the house.
 Just bring this coupon with you to the register and it'll be no charge."
...My patheticness really knew no bounds...
 But since she went through the trouble, I might as well take her up on the offer.
Even though it had started out as such a lovely day... I had to get carried away and do that stupid thing.
 ...I had completely ruined it.

<Keiichi>
"But really,
 ...you really saved my hide there.
 I've really come to see you as reliable."

<Shion>
"Even I was scared.
 But, Kei-chan was in trouble so...
 I had to be brave and do my best."
While a little embarrassed by what she just said, Shion made a show of folding her arms boldly.

<Keiichi>
"Shion, really, thank you..."
...I was thanking Shion.
 ...But I really wanted to thank Mion.
 ...Mion, really, thank you...

<Shion>
"Now now, cheer up a little.
 If you feel indebted, then when you have the chance you should help somebody in need.
 ...Like for example, if I'm ever in trouble.
 Please come and save me."

<Keiichi>
"Ah, ...yeah, of course.
 It's a promise."

<Shion>
"Ahahahaha! You absolutely have to!"
Taking advantage of my words, she seemed happy about my promise.

<Shion>
"So if I'm ever in trouble, Kei-chan will come and save me~!
 I hope trouble comes soon~☆.
 ...Ah, you finally smiled."
She said as she smiled herself, poking me in the cheek.

<Shion>
"A downtrodden Kei-chan is as good as an imposter.
 Come on, smile, smile!"

<Keiichi>
"Th-That tickles!
 S-Stop, wahahahaha...!!"
Thanks to Shion's meddling, I finally cheered up a little.
All the muscles in my body that had stiffened because of the incident finally began to relax a little...

<Shion>
"When you're in a better mood, don't you get a little hungry?
 I'm kind of hungry so I want to eat some pancakes or something.
 Do you want some too, Kei-chan?"
I wanted to show a little restraint, but restraint really wasn't my thing.
 That's why I replied without any.

<Keiichi>
"They're good, right?
 I'm pretty picky when it comes to pancakes."

<Shion>
"Ahahahaha!
 Don't worry.
 Our pancakes have a pretty good reputation."
Shion ordered some pancakes from a nearby waitress.
An employee ordering from another employee seems kind of weird...

<Keiichi>
"...Hey, hey, speaking of that, weren't you in the middle of a shift?
 You've just been slacking off while talking to me."

<Shion>
"I told my uncle that you saved me when I was surrounded by hoodlums, so he's rewarding you☆.
 So I have the manager's permission."

<Keiichi>
"That's exactly the opposite of what happened... Is that all right!?"

<Shion>
"It's perfectly fine. ...Ahahahahahahaha!"
By the time the pancakes arrived, we had entered into a relaxed conversation.
As the two of us ate pancakes, we livened the mood with some chit-chat.
...About what was on TV, celebrities, that kind of thing.
Hobbies, food.
 Really, nothing more than idle chit-chat.
Talking together like this, I once again became conscious of Shion being a girl.
...Hey now, that's funny talk, Keiichi Maebara.
Shion and Mion are the same person.
If there was anything different between them... it was only whether or not Mion admitted she was Mion.
But given that, how come our conversation was this different?

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, you don't think of my sister as a girl, do you~."

<Keiichi>
"Th-That's not true.
 If she were a guy I'd punch the living daylights out of her!"

<Shion>
"I think the reason you guys get along so well is because you have that kind of platonic relationship.
 ...That's a pretty rare and enviable thing to have, don't you think?"

<Keiichi>
"...I don't get what you're saying...
 But it really would be a waste to treat her like a girl."

<Shion>
"Heeey, Kei-chan, that's sexist! Ahahahahaha!"
Hearing the word "sexist" was cause for introspection.
What was I prejudiced against Mion and Shion for?
Mion was Mion.
She was the best friend a guy could have, no reservations, and head and shoulders above me when it came to club activities.
If I had met her five years earlier, my life would have probably been a lot more fun. Of this I had no doubt.
Then what about Shion?
...She was Mion's little sister, and it hadn't even been three days since we met.
 Her relationship was much more distant as the only thread we had in common was that I knew her sister.
And for Shion, it was the same. I was somebody she met three days ago only because I was a friend of her sister's.
...The difference between Mion and Shion?
 ...Friendliness?
 ...Familiarity?
...Playing around with those unclear thoughts for a while, I had stopped listening to Shion.

<Shion>
"Hypothetically, okay? Are you listening?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, sorry.
 Yeah, I'm listening."

<Shion>
"This is just an hypothetical question, okay?
 Both me and my sister are in trouble, okay?
 We're dangling off the side of a cliff.
 Which one of us do you save?
 You can only save one."
She wasn't saying it to tease me, but had a playful tone behind her voice.

<Keiichi>
"Th-That's not a nice question...!
 I want to save you both... but I can't do that, right?"

<Shion>
"Right.
 You can only save either Shion or Mion.
 Who do you save?"
...If it were Mion, I don't think she'd be in that situation in the first place, as it's something she could easily get out of herself.
...But what about the normal, frail Shion?
 I guess... I'd have no choice.

<Shion>
"It's not my sister, right?"
If Mion and Shion were different people, I suppose it would come to that.
I couldn't confirm nor deny it.
...She should have been smiling, but her gaze was locked firmly to mine.

<Shion>
"In other words,
 that's it, isn't it?
 My sister is...
 ...huh,
 ...ehehehe!
 Sorry, I messed up what I was trying to say."
Shion was trying to talk in a light-hearted manner, but I felt that there was something more behind her words.
Was Mion trying to tell me something through Shion?
Not being able to put a finger on exactly what it was was vexing.
Shion, to hide her embarrassment, turned the conversation around.

<Shion>
"More importantly, just now...
 Were you surprised?"

<Keiichi>
"Of course I was!
 If it were Rena or Satoko that would have been one thing,
 but for all those people, young and old to gather...
 They were all from Hinamizawa, right?"

<Shion>
"Yeah, that's right.
 Everybody in Hinamizawa is pretty close-knit.
 An enemy of one is the enemy of all.
 Nobody is going to look on from the sidelines.
 ...Ehehe, they're a pretty reliable group of residents."

<Keiichi>
"...If somebody is being picked on, then everybody unites to get rid of the bully.
 It kind of sounds like the mafia or the yakuza's brand of unity!"

<Shion>
"You shouldn't say something like that.
 It's something you should be thankful for.
 You were saved by that unity, weren't you?
 Never forget to show your appreciation!"
I half-heartedly agreed.
I knew full well I should be appreciative.

<Keiichi>
"Everybody really is close-knit, aren't they?"

<Shion>
"...Maybe it's because of tradition?
 Hinamizawa has been in danger of becoming a ghost town on several occasions. 

<Shion>
There's been a history of the villagers uniting together each time to fight for the village's continued existence.
 For example~... Kei-chan, did you know about the Hinamizawa Dam Project?"
Hinamizawa Dam Project?
...Let's see... I feel like I've heard somebody talk about it before.

<Shion>
"About ten years ago, there was a sudden proposal to build a dam here, which would have submerged Hinamizawa underwater."

<Keiichi>
"Oh, that story. I think I heard my dad talk about that...
 But I'm pretty sure that plan was cancelled, right?"

<Shion>
"We made them cancel it.
 Everybody banded together!
 So that was a well-earned victory."
That sounded pretty much like the story I heard.
The protest intensified to the point where it was featured in newspapers and magazines.
 ...As a result, the plan was suspended.

<Shion>
"The whole story with the dam apparently started before I was born.
 At first, the proposal was only for exploratory purposes, or a small dam to control erosion."
But, then the cat was let out of the bag...
If it were completed it would have been the biggest dam in Japan. Not just Hinamizawa, but several villages upstream would have been submerged as well.
The protests immediately began.
Petitions to cancel or relocate the project were drafted and submitted to the Diet.
They even went so far as to go to the Ministry of Construction in Tokyo to hand over a direct appeal to the Minister.
The previous landowner sued the government, stating there were inconsistencies in the purchase agreement and the transaction should be nullified. 
Owners of yet unacquired land split their properties, increasing the number of landowners in order to stifle the project.

<Shion>
"It was all very precious when the land acquisition was still about money.
 Eventually, they started relying on eminent domain in order to seize land.
 It started at that point. 

<Shion>
The riot police began to get violent."

<Keiichi>
"Riot police...
 You mean the police?
 Why would they act violent!?"

<Shion>
"They punched.
 They kicked!
 There was a time I was hit.
 Right around here I think.
 My skin split open and a whole lot of blood spilled out."
Saying that, Shion indicated her temple by poking at it.

<Keiichi>
"Wh-What happened to the police?"
Filing a complaint against the riot police for police brutality would seem kind of strange for some reason.
Naturally they wouldn't pay heed to something like that.
You wouldn't be able to establish proof on who exactly hit you, and they could justify their actions by saying you were interfering with police duties.

<Shion>
"My Nana went off like a firework.
 After that it was amazing!
 Like a full-scale war.
 We weren't just going to sit by and idly file complaints.
 We went on the offensive."
First, in order to call attention to the government, they filed a temporary injunction in court.
Then, in order to gain public support, they called in prominent scientists to state that Hinamizawa was a valuable nature preserve.
They pressured the prefectural and municipal assemblies, saying that the prefectural governor ignored his constituents when he approved the project, and demanded his resignation. They completely and thoroughly denounced him.
Naturally, in Hinamizawa, a ferocious conflict worthy of being called the "Dam War" began.
In order to suppress the police's brutality, they coordinated with the network channels and exposed the violence of the riot squad members to the public.
On top of that, they put together a special exposé themed around the government repressing the citizens, and aired it nationally.
 It worked wonders.
 Following that, the SWAT teams had their hands cuffed.
Day after day, the petitions and demonstrations continued. Propaganda was used to help garner support.
The circle of support gradually expanded outwards from Hinamizawa...
 Either that bore fruit, or the government finally decided against it. 
It was announced that the Dam Project was indefinitely suspended just a few years ago.

<Shion>
"We did everything we could.
 The entire village banded together and fought.
 At that time, we were desperate... but now that it's over it's actually become a pretty good memory. 

<Shion>
...The villagers' feelings of solidarity and unity still haven't faded."
Shion said that as she focused off into the distance.
I felt that those eyes weren't filled with anguish, but rather, a sense of pride.

<Keiichi>
"That kind of solidarity... is pretty nice.
 You don't see it too often.
 Bridging the generation gap and unifying the region."

<Shion>
"I think so too.
 The Dam Project was a trial. I think that just the fact we were able to overcome it is huge."
The fear I was feeling until just now gradually began to fade.
When people began to show up one after another while I was engaged with those thugs, I thought it was frightening.
...But now, I felt from the bottom of my heart that I had been rude.
The villagers, prepared to defend their homeland to the death.
 The sense of solidarity that fostered.
...It might seem impudent to say this, but... I was a little jealous.
If I had been in Hinamizawa when the protest against the dam was going on, I might have been able to share in that sense of solidarity.

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, you weren't here at the time, so I don't think you can fully feel the solidarity in the village.
 ...But everybody shares it.
 Thoroughly.
 Even with somebody who just moved here like you, Kei-chan."
...She couldn't have been more right.
So many people got together to help me out when I just moved here.
 ...Even though they were strangers whose names I didn't even know.
...A hot feeling began welling up inside of me.
When I lived in the city, I didn't even know my own neighbors.
I thought that was natural.
 But... here, that was an absurd and pathetic thing.
Even though I thought of them as strangers... all the other villagers viewed me as a comrade.
Happiness and warmth...
 I was acutely aware of those feelings as they gradually welled up inside of me.

<Waitress>
"Sonozaki-sa~n.
 The manager wants you to work the floor."
A more senior waitress waved her hand and called out to Shion.
 ...It seemed like it was time for work.

<Shion>
"Ah, okay! I'm co~ming!
 Sorry.
 Looks like I have to get to work now."

<Keiichi>
"It's fine.
 Thanks for hanging out with me, it was fun."

<Shion>
"...Oh ...Are you going home?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.
 My mom gets fussy if I'm not home by dinner time."
It seemed that Shion wanted to say something, but she swallowed her words.
 Like we hadn't talked enough, that kind of feeling.
Looking at that expression, I regretted saying something that had disappointed Mion like that.
I was about to say that I could stay for a little bit longer, when Shion got up from her seat.

<Shion>
"Here.
 If you use the coupon it should cover the pancakes as well."
Saying that, she showed me a coupon booklet as she tore out a few sheets and handed them to me.

<Shion>
"Convenient, isn't it?
 It's a perk I get on top of my salary."

<Keiichi>
"I-It's okay.
 I can pay for the pancakes myself."

<Shion>
"Hey hey~.
 Being so reserved doesn't fit you, Kei-chan.
 If I were my sister you would have gladly let me pay for it!"
She said as she laughed, gently stopping me from opening my wallet.
Being told so with such an encouraging smile really resounded with me.

<Waitress>
"Sonozaki-sa~n. Sorry, could you take care of the register~!"

<Shion>
"Ah, yes! Right away!"
Later! Today was fun.
 Saying that, Shion smiled one more time at me.

<Keiichi>
"Oh, Mion!
 Thanks a lot for today. I owe you one."

<Shion>
"If you really think that, then return the favor.
 I'm looking forward to it!"
After I said it, I realized I mistakenly called her Mion.
I didn't know if she realized it or not.
Lazing around and watching television after dinner was part of my daily routine.
It might seem like a waste at first glance, but you could say it was an important time when I was able to accrue knowledge of everything from politics to economics to various trivia.
After dinner was valuable time well spent while the brain was at its most supplied with nutrients.

<Keiichi>
"You idiot! It's obvious that Tokyo Tower is taller!!
 Ahhh!!"
Today I tested my knowledge of trivia by watching my weekly quiz show.
Sitting in front of the television, I was able to get a lot of the answers right.
 ...But if I were actually up on stage, I'd probably fail miserably.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi~.
 Phone call from Sonozaki-san."

<Keiichi>
"Okay~.
 ...Sonozaki?
 That's Mion!"
It was a little late for her to be calling.
 ...I had a bad feeling about this.
 I had a hunch it was something to do with club activities.
She was probably going to inform me about what we were doing tomorrow.
...This *was* Mion we're talking about.
She might even go so far as to say we're doing club activities right now, so hurry up and come over.
 By the way, it was 8 pm.

<Keiichi>
"Hello?
 No way we're having a club battle right now!"

<Shion>
"Huh!?
 ...That's not it...
 I mean..."
It was Mion, but it was a very un-Mion-like way of talking.
...Huh? Could it be...?

<Keiichi>
"S-Sorry.
 Could it be you're not Mion...
 but Shion?"

<Shion>
"That's right.
 ...Ummm... Good evening.
 I'm sorry for calling so late."
For Mion, this would have been an ill-fittingly polite way of talking.
 But since it was Shion, it was natural.
...Even though they were both the same person.
With a dry smile, I enjoyed that mysterious feeling.

<Keiichi>
"No, it's fine.
 What's up?"

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, do you like sweets, like cakes or desserts?"
There was no way I hated them. I'm an unabashed glutton!

<Shion>
"That's great.
 Actually, there's a new dessert contest this summer."
Looks like they have a new dessert menu every season.
So they were hiring taste-testers for potential desserts.

<Shion>
"The desserts at Angel Mort have a good reputation.
 It's pretty difficult to get accepted as a taste-tester.
 ...I'll get right to the point.
 Ta-da~☆."

<Keiichi>
"You say 'Ta-da~' but I can't see over the phone. Still... could it be..."

<Shion>
"That's right!
 I have a Taste-Testing Ticket right here.
 If you don't mind sweets, how about it?"

<Keiichi>
"When you say 'how about it,' you basically mean...
 With that ticket I can eat all the new desserts I want!?"
They say to beware of honeypots... but this is sweeter than any pot of honey!
 All-you-can-eat free dessert? No way!

<Shion>
"If you're okay with that, I'll register you as a taste-tester.
 When you come to the restaurant tomorrow, just give the person in charge your name.
 Then everything'll work out."

<Keiichi>
"When you say everything'll work out... you mean all-you-can-eat!?
 For free!?"

<Shion>
"Yeah, it's free.
 There's quite a bit, so I recommend you come hungry."
This was such a delectable opportunity it was almost scary.
...This was really Shion, right?
It wasn't Mion posing as Shion in order to bait me into a trap, was it...?
...What am I saying...
 They're the same person.

<Shion>
"Yeah, yeah.
 I know exactly what you're thinking, Kei-chan.
 You're thinking this is too good to be true, right?"

<Keiichi>
"Eep. I mean, I would never..."

<Shion>
"*snort*!
 Hee hee hee hee...
 I heard from my sister but... you're really somebody who can't tell a lie.
 I'm not averse to somebody like that. ...Hehehe!"
Shion laughed with a voice that sounded a lot like how Mion would laugh.

<Shion>
"It's not like I was intending on it...
 But it just so happens that my shift ends early tomorrow.
 ...If it's not a bother, I thought maybe we could spend a little time together after I'm done."

<Keiichi>
"Hmmm... your shift ends early tomorrow?"

<Shion>
"Yeah.
 So while you take your time eating dessert I'll finish up."

<Keiichi>
"Well... I didn't have any plans anyway.
 I don't mind hanging out with you for a bit."

<Shion>
"It's not like we have to go anywhere.
 I was thinking we could cool off in the evening while we take a walk."
There was no reason for me to refuse.
... Out of courtesy, I might as well take her up on her offer.

<Shion>
"By the way, Kei-chan... You and I have been meeting up every day, haven't we?"

<Keiichi>
"...Now that you say it, I guess we have."

<Shion>
"Since you said okay, we have an excuse to meet again tomorrow."
Huh??
 Wh-What was Mion saying??

<Shion>
"Ahahahahaha! Kei-chan, your voice just cracked.
 What's the matter?
 *snicker*"
It wasn't a video-phone, but she could tell I was beet-red!

<Shion>
"Well then, you should definitely come tomorrow!
 I'll take my leave here. Good night."

<Keiichi>
"G... Good night~."
Shion, finished with what she had called to say, ended the conversation without any chit-chat.
When I returned to the living room after hanging up the phone, the TV was already off and my mom was sleeping in the rocking chair.
Not feeling like turning the TV back on, I went back upstairs and returned to my room.

<Keiichi>
"I've only been receiving favors from Shion, haven't I...?"
She brought me a bento, and saved me when I got involved with those thugs.
She was supposed to be a different person, so I could thank Mion at school.
 ...Come to think of it, she'd probably just say she'll pass it on to her sister.
I have to thank Shion directly...
Tomorrow, I'll have to repay her somehow.



[Watanagashi Ch.5]

I knew we wouldn't be doing any club activities after school today before Mion even said anything.
I'd been invited over by Shion...
 ...For an all-you-can-eat dessert!!
I made a point of leaving half my lunch uneaten. My expectations would only be rivaled by my hunger!

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, you seem kind of happy today!
 Did something good happen? Did it!?"
I guess it was obvious.
 Rena had questioned me with a happy look.
That's right, why don't I invite Rena for dessert as well?
...No, if I recall correctly, Shion said something about having a ticket...
At worst, the restaurant might be admission by ticket only today.
If that was the case, then having Rena be turned away at the door would result in the worst feeling ever.

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.
 I got a little lucky.
 I'll tell you about it tomorrow!!
 Rena, you'll definitely be jealous~!!!"

<Rena>
"Whoa whoa whoa!
 What is it, what is it?
 I'm jealous, I'm jealous~!
 This lucky thing... is it kyuute? Is it?"
...Kyute?
...Hmmm, I wonder what Rena would think of the uniforms at Angel Mort.
...They'd definitely be a critical hit!

<Keiichi>
"...Probably.
 It's probably pretty kyute..."

<Rena>
"Whaaaa!?! I'm jelly jelly~!!
 What is it, what is it!?"

<Mion>
"Hmm.
 What kind of fortune were you blessed with?
 ...Huh?
 Could it be... You participated in the draw at Angel Mort about two months ago?
 And won?"

<Keiichi>
"Hey now, I hadn't even transferred here two months ago."

<Mion>
"Oh, that's right.
 Then it's not the Angel's Dessert Festa then..."

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, what is the Angel's Dessert Festa, exactly?"

<Mion>
"You know there's that family restaurant called Angel Mort right by Okinomiya Station?

<Mion>
Every season, they hold an event to promote their new dessert menu.
 That's today.
 ...Oh. It's no use going.
 The restaurant is reserved for people who won the draw."
Mion explained once again what Shion explained to me last night.

<Rena>
"Rena will have to stop by the restaurant sometime.
 I'll do my best to draw a winning ticket, and aim to enter the next all-you-can-eat event!"

<Mion>
"Ahahaha, knock yourself out!
 By the way, this is just something I heard, but there's a rumor that the tickets are being sold on the black market for a pretty penny..."
...Hearing that story, I felt even more appreciative of the ticket that Shion had procured for me.
I'd just thought I was lucky to be able to eat dessert for free... but it turned out that that ticket was much more valuable.
...The number of things I had to thank Shion for had increased again.

<Keiichi>
"T-Thanks...
 I didn't know it was worth so much..."
I whispered in a voice only Mion could hear.
 ...That was how I conveyed my feelings.
Mion looked at me for a moment before she tilted her head to the side and smiled confusedly.

<Mion>
"...Hm? What?
 Did you say something?"
It would be a problem if you said something to me right now.
 That smile seemed to be telling me as much.
I guess Mion wouldn't be accepting any gratitude while she was Mion.
I'll go to the restaurant.
Today, I'll thank Mion while she's Shion.

<Mion>
"Well then, this old man will take his leave here.
 The work today is gonna be a little rough~! Later~!!!"
Mion waved her hand energetically as she left.

<Rena>
"Hey, Keiichi-kun.
 ...Mii-chan has been kind of weird lately.
 Like she's elated or something."

<Keiichi>
"...Hm? What?
 ...Y-You think so?"
Rena was pretty sharp when it came to these types of things.
To me, Mion seemed the same as always... but Rena apparently felt something different.

<Rena>
"You don't know, Keiichi-kun?
 I totally thought you knew."
Rena's skirt fluttered as she spun around with a coy smile.

<Keiichi>
"Know what... exactly?"
I was obviously weaseling my way out of the question, but... I wasn't lying.
Honestly, I didn't really know what was going on.
Why did Shion, a persona of Mion that she'd created, appear before me?
Something was blatantly up, but Rena paid it no heed.

<Rena>
"Oh, really?
 I wonder what it is, then.
 When Mii-chan is in a good mood, so is Rena.
 Hau~~~♪"
Saying that, she spread her arms wide and spun around happily.
I didn't know why, but Rena was in a really good mood.
 ...It was so infectious that I had to smile too.
Even the chirping of the cicadas seemed joyful.

<Rena>
"But, you see..."
Rena abruptly stopped spinning. Her expression had returned to a more somber one.

<Rena>
"You see, Mii-chan...
 Lately...
 She's been in a lot of pain."

<Keiichi>
"What do you mean...
 ...pain?"
The pain that Rena was talking about probably wasn't physical.

<Rena>
"...At first she tried to pretend it wasn't a big deal...
 But like a wound...
 It began to fester...
 fester and grow.
 ...Eventually, she was no longer able to bear the pain, and woke up in the middle of the night. 

<Rena>
And then she phoned Rena.
 Mii-chan was... crying."

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm sorry.
 What... are you talking about?"

<Rena>
"What am I talking about?
 Huh?
 ...What *is* Rena talking about? What?"

<Keiichi>
"H-Hey, don't play dumb like that.
 Just now, you said...!"

<Rena>
"I don't know I don't know I don't knooooow.
 Rena doesn't know anything.
 Hau~~~~..."
Rena spun as she laughed innocently. Eventually, she appeared to get sick, stumbling as she steadied herself with her hand against the wall.

<Rena>
"Hau~~~...
 The room... is spinni~ng..."

<Keiichi>
"That was dumb!
 That's what you get for getting carried away and spinning like that!"

<Rena>
"S-Sorry...
 Hau... I think I feel sick..."
I'll lend the ditz a shoulder to lean on.
To be stumbling around like a newborn foal at this age is actually quite a feat.
Rena, in a good mood, only babbled incoherently after that.
I laughed as I responded to and chided her.
However, the chance to revisit that heavy topic Rena had brought up before never arrived.
As soon as I got home, I tossed aside my schoolbag and changed in a hurry.
The effects of only having a light lunch were starting to show...
 ...As my stomach began to let out fickle growls.
Alright, let's go! To Angel Mort!
It's time to face the land of endless dessert!!
Preparations for battle are complete!!
 Tally ho!!!
Angel Mort had a decidedly different feel to it compared to yesterday.
『Dessert Festa today - Admittance by reservation only.』
Nonetheless, the front of the store was being swarmed by over a dozen young men.
Judging by how they were looking upwards in jealousy instead of entering the store, they weren't invitees.
Why would they gather here if they knew they couldn't get in?
I found out the answer when I passed through the crowd and began to climb the steps to enter the restaurant.

<Man>
"A-Are you... a participant!?
 Do you have a ticket!?"

<Keiichi>
"...Y-Yeah.
 Well.
 I was lucky."
As soon as I said that, I was immediately mobbed!!!
It was like being in the middle of a football scrum on a crowded train!
 ...W-What... is going on...!!
Their reason was this:
It wasn't just one ticket per person; one ticket could let up to four people inside.

<Keiichi>
"...So it's like that, huh.
 ...Seems like I should have invited Rena and the others.
 Thanks for the tip...
 ...but I'll pretend I didn't hear that."
With an uplifting smile, I turned and ignored them. When I did... their arms all reached out at once, like the souls of the damned seeking succor!!!

<Otaku>
"""Th-That ticket can admit up to four people... please bring us with yooouuuuuuuuuu~!!"""
Wh-What selfish people...
This was the only reason they were crowded in front of the restaurant...!!
Dozens of wretched arms reached out for me like the teeth on a giant rake...
 And grasped at the air!!!
I was already climbing the stairs to the entrance.

<Man>
"W-What a heartless dick!!
 Grab him!!!"
Th-This isn't something to joke about!!
I flew up the rest of the stairs and threw myself inside the restaurant!!
 ...It was like I had entered a different world.
The miserable throng of the damned hurled curses at me from the other side of the glass door...
...but inside of this completely sound-proofed and air-conditioned restaurant...
 ...with the angelic smile of a waitress to welcome me, they were nothing more than a refreshing piece of scenery.
...I knew that I shouldn't laugh, but I began to let out a sinister cackle...

<Waitress>
"Good afternoon.
 Welcome to Angel Mort.

<Waitress>
Due to today's Dessert Festa, the restaurant is reserved for customers who won the draw.
 Could I ask for your name and ticket?"

<Keiichi>
"Umm... I don't have a ticket but I should be on the guest list.
 Maebara."

<Waitress>
"Maebara...
 Maebara.
 ...There it is.
 ...I'm sorry, but may I please have your full name?"

<Keiichi>
"Keiichi.
 Keiichi Maebara."

<Waitress>
"My apologies for the inconvenience.
 You're here by special invitation, right?
 I'll show you to your seat.
 Please, this way."
The mood inside the room was incredibly heated.
The booths were packed to the brim.
Men in their prime were stuffing their faces with dainty desserts that didn't suit them at all.  It was a rather unnerving spectacle...
Soon after I was shown to my seat, Shion arrived.

<Shion>
"Good afternoon.
 Welcome to Angel Mort."

<Keiichi>
"Hey Shion! Thanks so much for today.
 I really appreciate it."

<Shion>
"You were a bit late, so I was getting worried.
 I'm really happy you came, though."
It may have been because other customers were around that her tone was less casual, but she still capped off that welcome with her usual brilliant smile.

<Shion>
"...As you can see, there's a lot of customers here today. ...I'm not sure I'll be able to take a break.
 Please take your time and relax until I'm finished.
 When I'm done, let's go play somewhere, okay~?"
Whispering just that last part into my ear, Shion winked and returned to the kitchen.
...Maybe it was because the mood in the restaurant was so heated, but Shion seemed a bit bolder.
...Even a small change in her mannerisms was enough to set my heart aflutter.

<Shion>
"Sorry to keep you waiting~!"
While I was overwhelmed by the atmosphere inside the restaurant, orders from the new summer menu were carried out one after another.
...Every single one was extravagantly huge!!!
I get it... you can eat all of these amazing things for free... no wonder a ticket was worth its weight in gold.
On top of that, all of it was plenty delicious.
From dishes with a general appeal to insane ones aimed at a specific audience... there were absolutely no gaps in their repertoire.

<Keiichi>
"...No matter how you look at it... I don't think one person can eat this much.
 ...Well, let's just leave it at that for now."
...It didn't feel relaxing in here at all...
 Probably because the fervor inside the restaurant was clearly abnormal.
All the other booth seats were crammed with groups of four.
Sleazy men were gorging like pigs on cutely decorated desserts, and it wouldn't have been a surprise if they started licking the plates... it was more than a little unsettling...
It piqued my interest, so I started listening in on their conversation... and what things I heard!

<Otaku>
"*pant pant*
 Angel Mort, so moe~♪"

<Otaku>
"Me?
 I bought my ticket for 70,000 on [redacted] Auctions!"

<Otaku>
"I told work that I was attending a relative's funeral~♪
 The uniforms here are the greheheatest!"

<Otaku>
"I wonder if the waitress would wipe it for me if I spilled some water on my pants right meow~♪
 Meow~Meow~~!!"

<Otaku>
"I heard they're planning on selling Angel Mort figures.
 We'll have to pay heed at the next event...!!"

<Otaku>
"Speaking of which, that major figure maker decided to bring out the line!
 We must confirm the release date ...!"

<Otaku>
"'The problem is, there's too many variations to bulk buy them ... 

<Otaku>
If it were just a normal set of family restaurant uniforms, there'd only be around ten types... But, including the secret set with different poses that are planned, there's 100 or so!!"

<Otaku>
"Someone, trade with me when I get a double~☆
 It's my duty as a fan to complete the collection right away!
 No, this is destiny between us~!!"
...The words spilling out of their mouths were pretty much all incomprehensible jargon.
...But, they still keenly conveyed that hidden behind them was an invisible aura of abnormality!!

<Waitress>
"Sorry to keep you waiting~.
 The next dessert is 『Tropical Cinnamon Love Affair』. ...?
 Is something the matter?"

<Keiichi>
"...Ah,
 ...No.
 ...It's just...
 It's kind of different inside the restaurant today."

<Waitress>
"Our restaurant is pretty famous in their circles.
 Well, we were aiming for that so it's all well and good☆...
 ...But during Festas they're something of the more hardcore crowd, so it can be a handful☆."
The waitress informed me quietly with a wry smile.

<Waitress>
"The customers seem rather riled up... almost like a pack of hyenas."

<Waitress>
"Seems a lot of the customers today came from unreasonably far away.
 ...Those types of people are fairly prone to losing their self-control, so it's a little scary. 

<Waitress>
If you don't keep your guard up, something bad can happen."
What did she mean by 'keep your guard up'?
At that moment, a large crash resounded through the room.
I turned around, startled... to see that a waitress had fallen down... and spilled the order she was carrying right onto a customer.
 ...Wait ...Isn't that Shion!?

<Shion>
"I-I-I...
 I-I'm so sorry!
 Your food is... uhhh... ahhh..."

<Otaku>
"Oh, what have you done~!!
 The jeans that I bought at a certain specialty shop for a whole 1,800 yen are all shticky with frosting!!
 ...*pant pant*...♪"
...What the hell is that.
 ...For somebody who just met with disaster he seems awfully happy...

<Otaku>
"Hooow traagic.
 It seems that little miss waitress here will have to wipey-wipey it up from the bottom of her heart~♪"
The conversation suddenly veered off in an odd direction.
...Hey, hey. What did he say?
Wipey-wipey? Did he want Shion to wipe him down!?
...Right over that obviously aberrant tent he had pitched over his crotch!?!?

<Shion>
"Uh...
 But...
 That is,
 ...I-I
 ..."

<Otaku>
"""Wipey-wipey!
 Wipey-wipey!!
 Wipey-wipey!!!"""
The "Wipey-wipey" chant quickly spread throughout the room!!
Totally cornered, Shion went pale. She looked over to a more experienced waitress for help... but was only met with a head shaking out of pity.

<Waitress>
"...Sonozaki-san was tripped.
 Customers who do that to purposely get their clothes dirty have been on the rise lately."

<Keiichi>
"Ah, so you're saying she was tripped?
 Then what happened just now... wasn't an accident?
 ...It was on purpose!?"

<Waitress>
"The regular girls are careful about it, so they definitely won't end up like that... but Sonozaki-san is only a seasonal hire, so she had her guard down. 

<Waitress>
...The customers today could easily pick up on that... so she's been targeted since this morning."

<Keiichi>
"What's the manager doing!?
 He should just kick those thugs out!!"
"...We're in the service industry, so there's not much we can do about it."
 ...She laughed as she said that in a resigned tone.
Shion trembled uncontrollably with a dishcloth in her hands as she turned bright red...
The man who had been doused in frosting splayed out on the bench, putting the cream-covered tent over his crotch on full display.
...Still mentally unprepared... her trembling hand inched forward, goaded on by onlookers...

<Otaku>
"Come, come come!!
 It is the time for the wipey-wipey~~!!!!"
From my male point of view, it might have been a ridiculous spectacle I could just smile wryly at, but...
 From a woman's point of view... this was obviously pure humiliation.
...When I was trapped by those thugs and had been paralyzed with fear...
 Shion fearlessly stood up to them and saved me.
Still... as humiliating as it was... Shion was also partly to blame for this... and it wasn't as though her life was at stake, right...?
Even these guys... they were just going to jeer at her in a bit of a lewd situation, it's not like they were going to eat Shion alive or anything.
 ...It'd be all right if I just consoled her afterwards...

<Shion>
"Even I was scared.
 But, Kei-chan was in trouble so...
 I had to be brave and do my best."
When I, a man, was being assailed by three thugs while paralyzed with fear, Shion saved me without a second thought.
What about now?
...These sleazy, filthy degenerates were trying to pin the blame on Shion.
 ...This time, our roles were reversed.
Hey, Keiichi Maebara.
...If you don't save her now, when will you be able to repay the debt you owe her...??
You scared, Keiichi Maebara?
At that time, Shion... no, Mion... didn't even show a hint of hesitation.
Then what about now?
...I'm not hesitating.
Then what!?
If you're not hesitating then why aren't you helping her!?
......

<Otaku>
"Now, resign yourself to your fate~~~!!!
 Bwahwahwa~~!!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Shut up, you greasy fatass!
 Get out of here before I get angry."
I grasped Shion's shoulder firmly and pulled her behind me.

<Shion>
"K... Kei-chan..."

<Otaku>
 Yonder waitress was the one who wet mine pants!

<Keiichi>
"The one who needs punishing is you!!!
 Enough with the empty words!!
 If you're a man, talk with your fists!!!"
*THUD* *SMASH*
My body was lifted into the air like nothing... I was thrown right back into my own seat!!!
This guy is... strong!?
 No matter how you look at it 'athletic' and this lardo aren't even in the same area code...

<Otaku>
"Hehehe.
 Many otaku are unexpectedly well-versed in some obscure martial art. Don't be misunderestimating us~☆."
The man smirked, showing off his gumline.

<Shion>
"Ke... Kei-chan, are you okay!?"
D-Dammit... how lame must I look right now...?

<Keiichi>
"You were tripped, weren't you Shion?

<Keiichi>
They're the ones in the wrong here, so don't let them take advantage of you!"

<Shion>
"T-That may be... but...
 ...it was still... my fault..."

<Keiichi>
"WhooOooAaaaa!!
 One more time!!
 LET'S DO EEEEEeeeeet!!!"
*SNAP* *THUD* *CRAAAASH*!!!

<Keiichi>
"Don't you go thinking that this is enough to make me give up!!
 One more tiiiiiiime!!!"
*WHACK* *SNAP* *THUNK*

<Otaku>
"Hohoho!!
 You're all talk~!!!"

<Keiichi>
"I... I'm not done yeeeeeeeEEeeet!!!"
Rise, my will to fight!!
Hnnnnnnnwwwwwwwhoooooooaaaaaa!!
Not just running, I planted every one of my steps firmly as I closed the distance to the lardball.
Each time I ripped my foot off the floor, I could feel my burning spirit flare up from the point of impact!
Everything slowed down like I was walking underwater...
As I stepped forward in that viscous flow of time... I calmly measured the gap between us!!
With our difference in height, reach was my ultimate advantage!!
There was an ever-so-tiny distance between us where only my punch would be able to reach.
I unleashed my iron fist of righteous anger... but it flew towards his face slowly, like I was punching underwater.
Reacting to that... with a smirk on his face, the fatso easily slipped inside of my punch!!
I hadn't realized it until now, but in this mired time, I was able to observe his baffling counterattack with almost painful clarity!!
His arm slowly swung around in a large windmill motion...
wrapped around my whiffed punch,
 and descended in an arc...
That arm swung around like the arms of a clock...
 ...and came into contact with my head, twisting my upper body around!!
Dragging my head along, he followed through with another rotation!!
 This time he rotated his entire body like a top...
 followed by another rotation!!!
Combining defense and offense... it was a brilliant counter.
That's right... three times... I was thrown after three rotations, I think.
...In this viscous region of time, I was unable to struggle, and I could only wait dumbstruck until the moment I was thrown...
The moment I was, that sluggish temporal anomaly abruptly ended.
*CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH*

<Otaku>
"You lack training~
 Young man!!!"
...I was loathe to admit it... but against somebody trained in martial arts... I couldn't win through force of will alone!
After my consciousness faded in a wave of dizziness... when I came to, I was lying down in my own seat.

<Waitress>
"Thankfully you weren't injured."
The more experienced waitress from before wiped the sweat from my brow with a towel.
While she was doing that, a red-faced and teary-eyed Shion trudged over.

<Shion>
"Are... Are you okay?
 Doing that all for my sake... I-I'm sorry...."

<Keiichi>
"I'm sorry too... I wasn't much help.
 I've... never won a fight before..."

<Shion>
"No, you just trying to help made me... happy.
 I'm not joking.
 It's just that... I was thinking that it was lucky Kei-chan came here today."
As she said that, she stuck her tongue out teasingly.
...She wiped off the whipped cream with the washcloth she was holding in her hands.

<Waitress>
"Sonozaki-san, you can take your break now.
 You still have one or two hours left, don't you?"

<Shion>
"Ah... no, it's fine.
 Even though it's just part-time, it's still a paying job.
 I want to work properly while I'm on the clock.
 So really, you don't have to worry about me..."
She couldn't even put up a brave front.
I would never even think for a second that Mion could be that weak.
This was Shion, and she had been harassed by some unreasonable riffraff.
 That was reality.

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, don't mind me. Please eat as much dessert as you can.
 When you're done, we'll have you fill out a survey.
 ...Well then, I've got to get back to the floor."
After some consoling words and a sympathetic smile to Shion, the other waitress started to head back to work.
 ...That's where I stopped her.

<Keiichi>
"Excuse me.
 ...Could I borrow your phone?"

<Waitress>
"The phone?
 It's by the register.
 I'll show you where."
I pulled a 10 yen coin from my wallet.
This wasn't about saving face.
My being a worthless coward was an unchangeable fact, but I could just cry myself to sleep about that later tonight.
Now was not the time for tears.
I had to fight!

<Keiichi>
"If I recall, one ticket is good for up to four people, right?
 Is it alright if I call over three more people?"

<Waitress>
"Yes, that's fine...
 For the time being, I'll write them down on the guest list, could I have their names?"
...I turned around...
...and glared at the greasy hooligan who subjected Shion to that humiliation.
There are three things that aren't working in your favor today, punk.
The first is that I owe Shion.
The second is that I'm a man who's not afraid to throw away his pride to win.
And the third is...
 That we're the most powerful club members in history!!!

<Keiichi>
"Please add:
 Rena Ryuugu,
 Satoko Houjou,
 and Rika Furude to the guest list."

<Waitress>
"Understood. I'll do that."
I'll have the best and most powerful club members join the fray.
They can bring down a thousand foes!!
 You fatasses!!
 Prepare to meet your makeeeer!!!

<Rena>
"T-This is a nice restaurant!!
 Hau! The uniforms are kyute!!
 Rena wants to wear them too!!
 Hau~~!!"

<Rika>
"...On top of that we're being treated to dessert. I'm deeply moved."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah... eat as much as you like.
 Don't worry about my share."

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san, enough with the charades.
 Let's get to the point."
Rena and Rika-chan put down their forks when Satoko broached the subject.
...After looking at them for a few moments, I pressed my forehead firmly into the table.

<Keiichi>
"I beg of you.
 ...I don't care if you make fun of how pathetic I am!
 Please lend me your strength!!!"
The three of them seemed surprised by the sudden turn of events, but nevertheless listened to what I had to say without making fun of my unusual behavior.

<Rena>
"...Wh-What's the matter?
 Something happened, didn't it!? Didn't it!?"

<Keiichi>
"Actually... Mion's younger sister Shion is working part-time at this restaurant."

<Rena>
"Ah, that little sister you were talking about, right!?
 Could it be her? Could it!?
 She resembles her! Resembles her!!"

<Satoko>
"R-Resemble? ...That's just Mion with her hair down, isn't it...?"
Erp. ...I didn't know what to say.

<Rika>
"...If Keiichi says that's Shion, then that's Shion."

<Satoko>
"They might be twins, but can they really look that much alike?"

<Rena>
"They're called monozygotic twins.
 They really can look identical."
...Rena gave the most plausible explanation, so everybody else was convinced.

<Keiichi>
"W-Well then, do you believe me?
 I'll get to the point then."
I recounted everything that had just happened.
...How Shion was targeted, how she was antagonized by the customers, and the humiliation that was forced upon her.
...Also, how incredibly pathetic I was... I included everything without trying to hide it.

<Rena>
"T-That's awful.
 ...Poor Shii-chan."

<Satoko>
"However... for you to be unable to help her!
 There should be a limit to how unsightly you can be!"

<Keiichi>
"...There's nothing I can say to that."

<Rena>
"Satoko-chan.
 To admit that you lost and to seek help is a very difficult thing to do.
 Keiichi-kun chose to help Shii-chan rather than save his pride."

<Satoko>
"...Hmph. So pathetic."
Rena's follow-up stung a bit... but I could only be thankful that she understood.
Satoko was calling me all sorts of names, but there were no malign intentions behind her words.

<Rika>
"...Then, what should we do?"
Her voice was monotone... but there was a hint of resolve in her words.
I replied to Rika-chan's suggestive silence in kind with my own quiet resolve.

<Satoko>
"...Well, I thought it would be something like that.
 It is a bit much for Keiichi-san to handle alone."

<Keiichi>
"Huh? ...Then ...you'll help!?"

<Rena>
"Of course, Keiichi-kun.
 We'll help anybody who's being bullied."
...I remembered when I was cornered by those thugs. What Shion had said about the strong feeling of solidarity in Hinamizawa really began to hit home.
However, Keiichi Maebara!
Now is not the time to get choked up with tears of gratitude. Now... is the time to fight!!

<Keiichi>
"Sorry!! I owe you one!!"

<Rika>
"...You tried your best but didn't stand a chance alone. How sad, how sad."
Rika-chan gently pat my head for me.
...But there was no mindless pity in the palm of that hand.
It was overflowing with the strong, dependable feeling of "leave the rest to us."

<Keiichi>
"...Mion can't join us due to various circumstances, so I'll temporarily be taking command.
 ...Our strategy will revolve around Shion's defense and the extermination of the enemy's combat capability."

<Rena>
"Who's the enemy?
 Are there a lot of them?"

<Keiichi>
"From this point forward, anybody who messes with Shion shall be considered an enemy combatant.
 There are no rules of engagement.
 Compensation will be the dessert you just ate.
 ...Any questions?"
Everybody had already entered Club Mode, their eyes peering at the riffraff clamoring around inside the restaurant like predators stalking their prey from the darkness...
Rika-chan held up her hand.

<Keiichi>
"What is it, Rika-chan?"

<Rika>
"...Do we have to show mercy?"

<Satoko>
"Of course we don't have to!!
 We have no need to show mercy to the rabble that would dare lay a finger on Mion's little sister!!"

<Rika>
"...Then it's okay. Keiichi?"
...Rika-chan was... serious.
 ...She was really ready to pretty much murder someone.
 ...Ahh... I'm counting on you Rika-chan!!

<Keiichi>
"I, Keiichi Maebara, shall assume all responsibility.
 Rout them!!!"

<Rena>
"Ahahahahahahaha!
 Alrighty!
 Rena's going to do her best too!!"

<Keiichi>
"Sorry!!
 Please do...!!"

<Satoko>
"...Keiichi-san, you don't have to be so tense.
 ...Well, just wait and see.
 By the time you finish that parfait, we'll have finished cleaning up too."

<Rika>
"...Well then, everyone.
 Let's give it our all.
 Go for it, yay."

<Satoko>
"""Yaaaay!!!"""
Thus...  the most powerful warband the world had ever known, trained by Mion, began to move.
I was the oldest, the only boy, and behaved like a leader... but when you consider our club activities, I was by far the most junior member.
Individually, everyone besides me had terrifying combat capabilities.
If all of them combined their strengths to protect Shion...!?
I couldn't even imagine.
...I was probably about to witness something terrible and awe-inspiring...

<Waitress>
"Sonozaki-sa~n, five Deluxe Parfaits for table seven~!"

<Shion>
"Ah, sure thing!!"
Shion carried the order to the tables.
For Shion to carry all five parfaits without wobbling took so much effort that she didn't have the breathing room to pay attention to her feet...

<Otaku>
"Hehehe... comrades, here she comes yet again...!!"

<Otaku>
"This time we'll have her spill everything on my pants, and have her give an especially thorough wipey-wipey!!"
It was the same wipey-wipey scheme that had occurred just a short time earlier.
 This time, another one of them was trying it out for himself... the very depravity of these men was itself a full-out attack!!!

<Keiichi>
"Rena, this is Keiichi.
 Ambush them around tables five and six.
 ...Rena? Do you copy!?"

<Rena>
"The restaurant's uniforms... sooo kyuute!! Hau~ ...I want to take them home~...!"
Shion, her bottom swaying while carrying the parfaits, was being chased by an equally swaying Rena.
She was supposed to be escorting Shion, but Rena was instead transfixed by the back of her uniform.
From a normal person's point of view, it was probably like having a fox guard a henhouse...
 ...but when it comes to Rena, things are different!

<Keiichi>
"Kyute mode, 120% synchronization...
 We've won."

<Satoko>
"...When Rena's in that state, even the laws of physics don't apply."
Shion's legs, unsteady and defenseless... were being targeted by those sleazebags!

<Otaku>
"Now, my comrades!!"


<Otaku>
"Heil mein Fuhrer, shining Lucifer of the Harumi Mecca!!!"
A leg snaked out to trip Shion's defenseless feet!
 Egads... three of them at once!!!
*THAP THAP THAP*

<Otaku>
"Gya!?"

It happened in an instant!!!
The three fools writhed in pain as their legs bent at unnatural angles!

<Otaku>
"Aarggghhhhhh!?!?"

<Otaku>
"W-W-W-W-What...is this maaaaadneeeeeessss!!"
Rena teetered into view, and gave them a warning(?).

<Rena>
"Hau~~~~ No mischief, okay~☆.
 No means no. No!
 Rena's going to be the one to take her hoooome~~~♪"

<Otaku>
"T-T-This girl.... what's with that strange techniiiiiiiiiiique!!"
The human scum clutched at their bruised ankles as they passed out...

<Satoko>
"That's our Rena-san...
 ...No matter how many times I see it it's always frighteningly quick."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.  It's an unbreakable barrier!!
 Anyone within a two-meter radius who attacks Shion is completely obliterated by Rena!!"
As Shion was making her rounds through the restaurant, there were people here and there collapsing with welts on their legs or hands...

<Rena>
"Hau~~~☆.
 Keiichi-kun, this is Rena.
 There's nobody left that'll bother Shii-chan~.
 So I'm going to take her home now~~!!"

<Keiichi>
"Rena, this is Keiichi.
 Good work.
 Please continue the mission.
 Also, permission to take home denied!
 I repeat, permission to take home denied!!"

<Rena>
"Then I'll just look, I'll just look☆. Hau~~~~~♪"
...I guess just looking is fine.
That wouldn't prevent her from guarding Shion, so I guess it's okay...
Anyway, thanks to this I knew who had tried to mess with Shion!
Anybody who was clutching at their arm or leg while they were writhing in agony was basically branded by their bruises!

<Keiichi>
"Currently, we have finished identifying all enemy forces.
 Proceeding to the next phase.
 Satoko, this is Keiichi!
 What's your status!?"

<Satoko>
"This is Satoko.
 ...That's a rude way to ask.
 Keiichi-san, exactly who do you think I am?"
Satoko was in the kitchen.
She had spread open a sketch of the restaurant on the counter, replete with order chits and their destinations, and was now sorting through the freshly made desserts.

<Shion>
"...Hey... what are you doing!?"

<Waitress>
"Now, now☆.
 Sonozaki-san, it's all right, just leave it to her!
 More importantly, we're taking all these orders out at once, so I'm counting on you!"
The veteran waitress was briskly directing her juniors as the trays went out one after another.
All the desserts that had passed through Satoko's hands were delivered at once.

<Rena>
"Hau~~!!
 Lots of kyute desserts are coming~!!
 Hau~~!!"

<Keiichi>
"...I think you know this, but don't touch them.
 At least, if you still value your life."

<Rena>
"I-I know but... Hau~~!!"
Certainly, they were all incredibly cute-looking desserts.
 They were all works of art that you could enjoy before even taking your first bite!
However, since Satoko had meddled with them... they were nothing more than an unpredictable danger!
Blissfully ignorant of that fact were the men now stuffing their faces!!

<Otaku>
"Hrngh..."

...Almost right away, they realized that something was wrong.

<Keiichi>
"Satoko.
 ...What did you mix in there?
 It couldn't have been salt or tabasco, right?"

<Satoko>
"Myyy, what ARE you saying Keiichi-san?
 You said no mercy.
 I might not look like it, but when I get down to business, I like to be very thorough!"
As she said that, she twirled a dubious phial in her fingers before putting it away smartly into her pouch.

<Satoko>
"Rika, this is Satoko.
 The customers are moving.
 Escort duty is all yours~!"

<Rika>
"...Leave it to me."
...Come to think of it, I didn't see Rika-chan anywhere.
 Where could she be lurking...?
*Clatter clatter*
 Several men stood up suddenly from their seats, surveying the restaurant for something.
That restless fidgeting.
...And that look of relief when they found the single placard hanging from the ceiling.
Written on that placard was the word... "Restroom."
 They began a mad rush in that direction!
It wasn't just one or two people.
All the people that were branded as 'The Enemy' were standing up from their seats while clutching at their stomachs.

<Otaku>
"Ugh... I think I was a little too greedy...
 Where's the washroom..."

<Otaku>
"Mew too.
 Not a nyamber one, but a nyamber two!
 I need to cash out meow!"

<Otaku>
"Where's da toilet!?
 I found eeeet!
 Urine for it now!!!"
...I felt dirty just thinking about what Satoko probably did to their desserts.
The problem was how to follow this up.
...I was intrigued, so I followed the rush of men to the washroom.
The narrow hallway connecting to the restroom was crammed with about ten men.

<Otaku>
"""W-W-W-What... what is thiiiiiiiiiiiis!!!"""
As I peered over to see what was happening... whoa!!
It seemed that the toilet was clogged and backflowing, unleashing a loud gurgling sound and a terrible stench!!!
There was no way to use it in this state!!!
D-Damn that Satoko... what a frightening display of power!!!
N-No. This wasn't Satoko's doing.
It was divine punishment.
Yeah, they were just unlucky.
I'll just apologetically ask one of the employees here to clean it up.

<Otaku>
"I-I can't do my business like this!!"

<Otaku>
"Arrrrrgh!!
 What do we do meow, comrades!!"
...It was a brilliant combination of traps... but it would be better if there were one more push to the kicker.
...Seeing as it was Satoko, she wouldn't have overlooked that!

<Otaku>
"Meow that it's come to this... i-i-it's time for the last resort..."
Faced with a moral dilemma, that man only had one other option
 ...
 「Women's Restroom」!!!

<Otaku>
"Isn't using the girl's room going to get us in trouble!?"

<Otaku>
"I'm purrty sure there's no female customers today!!
 Why didn't I think of that befur!!"

<Otaku>
"*pant pant*... Women's toilets are the best~~!!!!!"
W-What a brazen bunch they are!!
The men, sweat now pouring from their brows, made a mad rush to the girl's room without any hesitation!

<Rika>
"...Meep?"

<Otakus>
"""Nnnnwaaaaaaaaaaah!?!?"""
There was girl there... it was Rika-chan.
The men stood there, frozen in various complicated poses indicating their surprise...
Rika-chan also seemed dumbfounded by the sudden turn of events...
...but the look on her face was strangely perfect.
 This was all part of the plan as well.
You sly dog, Rika-chan. I should never underestimate you!!

<Otaku>
"D-D-Dis is, you see,
 Mademoiselle..."

<Rika>
"...Meep."

<Otaku>
"The men's room is bit dangerous at the moment, so we just want to borrow the toilet here right meow... Meow~~♪"

<Rika>
"...Meep..."

<Otaku>
"B-B-But... I guess it's not right after all!! R-R-R-Right, my comrades!!"
Just by having a girl stand there in the restroom... I never knew it could put up such an overwhelming barrier...
There was no way anybody could be brave enough to lift Rika-chan out of the way to try and do their business!
...Hmph.
This was the most they could do after all.
If it were a man in full Club Mode (for example, someone like me)... they would plow through Rika-chan without a second thought!!
Now what are you going to do, you fatasses!?
The price for tormenting Shion still hasn't been paid!!!

<Rika>
"...If you're in trouble, I can help you."

<Otaku>
"T-T-That would be much appreciated!!!
 How would you do that?"

<Rika>
"...You can use one of the toilets outside.
 I'll show you to them."

<Otaku>
"That would be purrfect!!
 Purrease, purrease!!
 At this rate it'll end up becoming group enema purray~~!!"
Rika-chan, with a pleasant smile on her face, guided them with a casual stride in her step.
In this race against time, her slow pace was... sadistic torture!!

<Otaku>
"Mademoiselle... is this toilet far from here??"

<Rika>
"...We'll get there soon."
Obeying Rika-chan's directions, they were about to leave the restaurant...

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, finish it.
 Give 'em hell!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah!! Leave it to me!!"
I spread my arms out and blocked them as they tried to leave the restaurant!!

<Otaku>
"What is the meaning of thiiiiiis!!!
 We're at Defcon 1 heeeere!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Listen up, you tubs of lard!!
 You know what happens if you even set one foot outside this door, right!?"

<Otaku>
"What is the meaning of the purrposterous statement!?!?"

<Rena>
"Ahahahahaha! Look, it's written right here on the ticket.

<Rena>
'Not valid for re-entry,' see?"

<Satoko>
"You're free to use any toilet you want, but the moment you step outside that door you can't come back!!"
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!

<Otaku>
"""Y-Y-You'll remember this!!!"""

<Rika>
"...I don't want to guide anybody who says scary things like that."
Everybody panicked as Rika-chan began to turn back.
 They could only figuratively and literally fall in line...
All the waitresses also lined up to see them off.

<Waitress>
"Thank you very much for coming~☆"

<Otaku>
"""We shall retuuuuuuuuuuurrrn!!!!"""
*clang clang*
The bell rang playfully as the door shut behind them.

<Satoko>
"How puuh-thetic!! Too easy!!"

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha! We did it! Yaaay!"
Rena and Satoko clapped their hands together.

<Keiichi>
"Whew... I couldn't hold a candle to those guys by myself, but when we get the group together...  we sent them packing like a herd of cattle."

<Satoko>
"With opponents this weak, any of us could take them on by ourselves.
 Keiichi-san, you need to up your game~!"
...I was loathe to admit it, but Satoko was right.
 Dammit!
 One day I'll be strong enough to be worthy to stand alongside them!!

<Rena>
"But, I'm really glad we were able to protect Mii-chan's little sister!
 Now there's none of those bad people who were pulling pranks left!"

<Waitress>
"You're blessed to have such wonderful friends, Sonozaki-san."
The veteran waitress was also smiling.
After the herd was sent packing, it had calmed down completely inside the restaurant. Shion was flustered as she glanced between us and the now-empty seats.

<Shion>
"Y-Y-You did that... for me...?
 ...I ...I mean..."
Shion's expression was somewhere between happy and guilt-ridden... her face had turned slightly red as she ran into the kitchen.

<Rena>
"Whoa... Shii-chan is kyute!!
 They really are twins~ Hau~~!!!"
Given Shion's personality, there's no way she'd thank us directly.
We might have been a bit excessive in our means, but I'm really glad we were able to save her...

<Waitress>
"I think you know this already, but Sonozaki-san is very grateful.
 As a representative of the floor staff here, I also extend my gratitude."
*clap clap clap clap*
The applause quickly spread throughout the entire restaurant.
Not only the other waitresses, but also the customers that were genuinely there to enjoy the desserts: everyone was lauding our efforts...
When we had mostly finished eating and were filling out the survey, Rika-chan made her return.

<Keiichi>
"Ohh, good work!
 Did everything go all right?
 You took a while."

<Rika>
"...I'm sorry.
 I got lost on the way back. It was a lot of trouble."

<Rena>
"Ahahahahahaha.
 Rika-chan likes to stray down some pretty strange roads, so she gets lost pretty often."
...How did she get lost just guiding people to a nearby toilet?

<Satoko>
"Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.
 Rika has a lot of strong points that more than make up for that!"

<Keiichi>
"I can see that.
 That expression in the girl's room! You're quite the thespian!!"

<Rika>
"...Keiichi was being horrible.
 He was thinking 'If I were in their shoes, I'd just run her over and rush into the washroom.'"

<Keiichi>
"Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?!?
 Did what I was thinking show up on my face again!?"

<Rena>
"Ke-Keiichi-kun... Hau..."

<Keiichi>
"No... I mean... Wahahahahahaha...!!!"
I could laugh about it then, but a few days later, a newspaper headline read: "Ten unidentified men were taken into custody in Hideyama.
The men claim they had travelled from Shishibone City by foot to find a toilet, but the spot they were taken into custody was xx kilometers away from Shishibone..."
When I read that article, I realized how terrifying Rika-chan really was...

<Rika>
"...Well, thanks for treating me.
 I'm happy that you called me here today."

<Satoko>
"Oh, are you going home already?
 You can stay a little longer..."

<Rika>
"I was in the middle of organizing some drawers.
 If I leave it like that, I won't be able to put out the futon."

<Satoko>
"Ah,
 ...I guess that's true."
Oops, looks like I called her at a bad time.

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 When I phoned her she was in the middle of cleaning her room.
 But she still came!"

<Satoko>
"Well.
 It was an emergency so it couldn't be helped."

<Rika>
"...Besides that, I got to eat a looooot of sweets, so I'm very happy."

<Keiichi>
"Thanks for today.
 Sorry for calling you out suddenly."

<Rika>
"...Tell Shion I said bye."

<Satoko>
"I'll be taking my leave, then.
 Rena-san, please take your time."

<Rena>
"Yeah, I will!
 Laater!"
Rika and Satoko, in a good mood, horsed around with each other as they left...
While Rena and I were having a discussion about the dessert we just ate, Shion arrived with some coffee.

<Shion>
"...Oh.
 ...Um, did the two little ones leave already?"
Hearing them called the little ones was so strange, I inadvertently burst out laughing.

<Keiichi>
"Ahahaha!
 Apparently they were in the middle of cleaning, so they went home."
Shion had brought enough coffee for four people.

<Shion>
"I heard from my senior.
 ...It seems that you... went through a lot of trouble for my sake..."

<Rena>
"It was no trouble at all.
 None other than Shii-chan was in a pinch, after all.
 ...Oh, is it all right if I call you Shii-chan?
 It matches with Mii-chan so I thought it'd be kyute!"

<Shion>
"Ah... well... whatever you want..."
Shion seemed a bit hesitant when Rena started talking to her.
Rena is pretty sharp about some things, so Shion was probably worried that Rena would find out she was Mion after talking like this.
Shion said she'd have work soon and hurried off back to the kitchen, leaving behind coffee for just the two of us.

<Rena>
"She was a bit upset with Rena.
 Maybe she thought I was being too friendly... Hau..."

<Keiichi>
"She's just embarrassed."

<Rena>
"Still, they really do look the same.
 Instead of twins, it's like there's another Mii-chan."

<Keiichi>
"They look the same, but the atmosphere around them, or rather, their insides are completely different.
 I think those types of twins are pretty interesting though~."

<Rena>
"You think that, Keiichi-kun?
 ...I think they're identical on the inside too."
It somehow became silent.
Rena was just staring at the pattern the milk made on the surface of her coffee without saying a word.
...For somebody like me who could never stop talking, it was a rather uncomfortable moment.
Rena's offput mannerisms seemed to imply I said something I shouldn't have.
That unpleasantness carried on for a little while.

<Keiichi>
"...Rena.
 You said it today, right?
 That Mion was hurting..."

<Rena>
"Did I say something like that...?"

<Keiichi>
"Don't play dumb with me!
 You definitely said it. On the way home from school."
Rena answered by laughing while continuing to play dumb, questioning if she said that...
As thick-headed as I was... I had a faint realization.
Rena wanted to say that I was the one who hurt Mion.
 ...But, when?
 Me?

<Keiichi>
"Hypothetically...
 ...
If something like that happened...
 It's not something I did out of malice."
I continued the conversation, but left out the assumption that I had hurt Mion.

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 I think that's true.
 I don't think Keiichi-kun had any bad intentions."
Rena replied, also leaving out the assumption that I had hurt Mion...
 but that confirmed it.
I don't know how it happened... but it seemed that I had hurt Mion...
 and Rena was upset with me due to the fact I hadn't realized it...

<Rena>
"I don't want you to misunderstand, it's not like Rena is mad at you."
Seeing right through what I was thinking, Rena said that as she smiled even more gently than usual.

<Rena>
"It's just that... How do I say this...
 It's hard..."

<Keiichi>
"...If I made a mistake, please say so clearly.
 I'm so thick-headed I disgust even myself.
 ...If there's something I should apologize for, then I'd want to know even a little quicker so I can make up for it."

<Rena>
"I don't think that Keiichi-kun made a mistake.

<Rena>
Depending on how you look at it... Mii-chan might be the one who's being unfair.
 Taking the stance that the girl was the one being unfair might be unfair in itself."
What Rena said was draped in mystery... unfortunately I had no idea what she meant.
The only thing I got out of it was that I had said or done something to inadvertently hurt Mion.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm begging you, Rena.
 ...Mion is one of my best friends.
 I don't want to leave something between us that could cause problems later on.
 ...So tell me.
 How did I hurt her...?"

<Rena>
"I can't tell you.
 You need to realize something like this for yourself."
Rena was smiling like she always did, but spoke bluntly.
...The fact that she had this strength of will surprised me for a moment.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm asking you because I can't figure it out, you know!?"
My tone had unintentionally become harsh.
Rena was also surprised for a moment, but quickly returned to her flat demeanor.

<Rena>
"Well then, I guess just a hint is fine.
 This is special, okay?"

<Keiichi>
"...Sorry.
 Please.
 I'll think about this seriously."
Rena looked around the restaurant, searching for Shion.
Shion was working enthusiastically, but without confidence as usual.

<Rena>
"Shii-chan, if she ties her hair up, is impossible to tell apart from Mii-chan, right?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, that's true."

<Rena>
"So then.
 So if Mii-chan let down her hair, would she be impossible to tell apart from Shii-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"Probably.
 ...But what does that have to do with anything?"

<Rena>
"What if...
 What if that her being the younger twin was a lie, that she was just Mii-chan pretending to be her sister. What would you think?"
...Rena was sharper than her daily behavior belied.
I was hesitant in verbally affirming that, but it was the right answer.

<Keiichi>
"It might be unfair to answer a question with another question.
 ...But if like you say, Mion is just pretending to be Shion... what purpose would that serve?"
After maintaining the silence for a while, Rena glanced at the clock.

<Rena>
"That's what I want you to think about.
 ...Hmmm, that was maybe too much of a hint. ...Hau."
After thanking me for the dessert, Rena stood up from her seat.

<Rena>
"Sorry. I was asked to buy a few things, so it's about time I left.

<Rena>
Is it okay with you if you tell Shion I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, I'll tell her..."

<Rena>
"Sorry."

<Keiichi>
"Huh...?"

<Rena>
"That Rena is so short-tempered.
 ...Sorry for getting angry.
 Keiichi-kun isn't the only one at fault here."
Rena was harsh in her apology, but I was the one who really should have apologized.

<Rena>
"I think to Mii-chan, it's something that doesn't bother her much anymore.
 So if you want to forget the whole thing happened, that's fine too.

<Rena>
...But you see, as a girl, I'd hope that Keiichi-kun realizes it by himself and comes to apologize of his own volition.
 ...Hau♪"
Switching to Kyute Mode only at the end, she disappeared in the direction of the register.
While I was staring into space, somebody suddenly tapped me on the shoulder.

<Shion>
"Sorry to keep you waiting...
 Ehehe... I'm finally done."
It was Shion, who had changed into her street clothes.
She flashed a smile while greeting me.

<Keiichi>
"Thank you so much for today.
 Everything was delicious.
 We were all really happy with it."

<Shion>
"Oh no, don't mention it.
 ...but I'm glad everybody had fun.
 ...Huh?
 That girl that was just here left as well?"

<Keiichi>
"She had some shopping to do.
 She said she was sorry for leaving without saying anything."

<Shion>
"I see.
 ...Well then, should we leave as well?
 Even though I'm off-duty, I'm still nervous around the workplace☆."
We ended up strolling around without any destination in particular.
I had been sitting the entire time, so I was in need of a breath of fresh air.
When we left, the sky had already become draped in a veil of darkness.

<Shion>
"Aaaaahh.
 It's gotten dark already.
 ...Even though I promised I'd be finished early."
Shion seemed upset that there wasn't much time left.

<Shion>
"Oh well.
 At least we've got a little time to chat like this."
Saying that, Shion set out for the tree-lined boulevard behind the station.
The front of the station was slowly becoming crowded with businessmen heading home.

<Shion>
"Well then.
 I guess I should start with an introduction.
 ...I was mistaken for my sister when we first met, so we never got to properly introduce ourselves."
I could only smile and laugh wryly.

<Shion>
"My name is Shion Sonozaki.
 I'm only similar to my older sister in appearance.
 My sister is rough around the edges and hot-headed, but I'm a composed and methodical person."
I remembered what Rena and I had been talking about earlier.
I said that they looked the same but their personalities were different, while Rena said they were both the same.
I don't know what tipped her off, but Rena figured out that Shion was Mion.
Also, related to that, she said that I had hurt Mion.
Rena had given only one hint.
That was: why is Mion pretending to be Shion?

<Keiichi>
"Shion, what did you hear about me from Mion?"

<Shion>
"My sister seems to have taken a liking to you.
 She talks about you quite a bit.
 Like about club activities, about getting pranked and pranking you back. Boyish kinds of stories.
 ...You really do get along."
'Boyish kind of stories,' huh.
Come to think of it, I think there was something Shion told me before.
"Kei-chan, you don't think of my sister as a girl, do you~?"
...Was that... was that what happened that hurt Mion?
Mion herself said that she wished she'd been born a boy, and that being a girl didn't suit her. She said a lot of things to that effect, didn't she...?

<Shion>
"...Kei-chan, you look like you're having fun."

<Keiichi>
"Huh? ...Ah, no! That's not true."

<Shion>
"Even though you're bad at hiding things, you sure like to lie, don't you?
 Still, I don't hate you for it."
Saying that, she lightly chopped my forehead.
...Even though Shion was enjoying herself, I was still trying to figure out how I had hurt Mion.
 I was having a hard time figuring out the riddle that Rena had left me with...

<Shion>
"Hey, see that? Don't you think it's pretty? You think even a guy would find it pretty?"

<Keiichi>
"Hmmm.... yeah, it is pretty!"
Shion was having fun window shopping, dragging me by all sorts of stores I would normally never enter.
It wasn't like she was begging me to buy her anything, and I wasn't getting bored, either.
It was just something to talk about as we walked around.
In an easy-going way, we browsed through numerous stores.
We discussed all sorts of topics I knew nothing about, but I didn't lose interest.
 I had the feeling she was good at conversation.

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, is this your first time doing this kind of thing?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, it is.
 If somebody didn't bring me into these accessory shops, I don't think I'd set foot in one my entire life."

<Shion>
"...Not that...
 I meant, more like this."
Bwah!?
I leapt back when Shion suddenly linked her arm with mine.

<Shion>
"Hey... you don't have to act so surprised.
 It's not so embarrassing to link arms with a girl, is it?"
Shion's expression was a little bit miffed, but suggestive at the same time.

<Keiichi>
"I-I-I-I-I'm not that embarrassed!
 If you want some arms I can spare one or two.
 ...Here!"

<Shion>
"Hehehe...!
 Kei-chan, you really know how to entertain someone.
 I see why my sister took a liking to you."

<Keiichi>
"I-If you don't want my arm, I'm taking it back!"

<Shion>
"Ahahahahaha!
 Awww, c'mon~.
 I'm happy to have it~!"
Laughing in good spirits, Shion locked her arm with mine. ...My heart skipped a beat.

<Shion>
"This question might be a bit mean, but I want to enjoy seeing your reaction. Kei-chan, have you ever been arm-in-arm with a girl before?
 Around a bonfire at a field trip doesn't count, by the way."
...That little devil!!
 She was asking that question knowing full well what the answer would be!

<Keiichi>
"...Well, if field trips are out...
 ...This is rough."

<Shion>
"Hehehehe...!!
 I thought as much~."

<Keiichi>
"That impish laugh, it really is the same as Mion's!

<Keiichi>
You really are Shion, right?
 You're not just Mion saying that you're Shion, are you?"

<Shion>
"Are you thinking that my sister might pretend to be me?"

<Keiichi>
"I thought you were twins until just now, but that way you mess around is just like Mion!"

<Shion>
"You're just saying that.
 You can tell us apart easily."

<Keiichi>
"What do you mean by that?"

<Shion>
"If my sister was holding your arm like this, would you get nervous?"

<Keiichi>
"I would.
 I'd be completely on edge worrying about when she would go for an armlock."

<Shion>
"Ahahahahaha!"
Shion laughed so hard she had to hold on to her sides.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, hey, is it really that funny?
 You're tearing up."

<Shion>
"No, no... It's just...
 I was just thinking about how hopeless my sister is.
 She isn't even able to get a young man hot and bothered while she's arm in arm with him.
 She really is a failure as a woman."
I remembered once again that I'd heard someone say that before.

<Shion>
"Sometimes I think that my sister would have been better off if she'd been born a boy.
 ...If she did, I might have fallen for her.
 Just kidding~! Ahahahahahaha!"

<Keiichi>
"...Mion did say something about wanting to be born a boy."

<Shion>
"My sister is on the fence as to whether she wants to be a boy or a girl.
 Well, it's the price she pays for living an awkward lifestyle.
 Just leave her be."

<Keiichi>
"You've been saying some pretty harsh things about your sister right now."

<Shion>
"Mion has some soft parts to her that I don't like."
The way that Shion talked somehow sounded cold.

<Keiichi>
"Shion, do you not get along with Mion?"

<Shion>
"Well, we get along well enough.
 Still, there's a few things for which I can't forgive her, as her sister.
 ...Hey, look at that!
 Don't you think it's cute...?"
I turned around to look at where Shion was pointing... what was there was the familiar display window of a toy shop.
The same shop that was the stage for the incident that occurred during last Sunday's club activities.
What Shion was pointing at was a display with a plethora of adorable dolls that looked like the sort girls would like.

<Keiichi>
"I wonder why girls like these kinds of things."

<Shion>
"It's because they're cute.
 Don't you think they're cute, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"...I'm a man, so I don't really get that vibe."

<Shion>
"Now, now.
 Which one do you think is the cutest out of all these, Kei-chan?"
Shion, pulling on my arm, motioned to the row of dolls.
...They were lined up like they were close sisters taking a commemorative photo.
A few of them seemed strangely familiar.

<Keiichi>
"...I've seen those four over there somewhere."

<Shion>
"Oh, I guess they really are famous...
 if even you know about them."
Shion sounded impressed.

<Shion>
"These are new dolls that were just brought in from England. 

<Shion>
They still have some available here, but around the cities they have trouble keeping them on the shelves. Even though they're supposed to be inexpensive, it seems they're starting to come at a premium."

<Keiichi>
"I guess girls still like these kinds of things even as they grow up."

<Shion>
"It depends on the person, but I think that girls who don't like dolls and stuffed animals are pretty few and far between.
 Even my tomboy of a sister said these were adorable."

<Keiichi>
"Oh?
 Even Mion says they're adorable. That *is* pretty amazing."
That's right, I just remembered.
The store owner gave this one to us after Sunday's event.
Except for Mion, who was a relative, everybody had gotten something.

<Shion>
"I really do think that one's the best...
 That frilly dress really gives it something..."

<Keiichi>
"...That's it.
 That's the one the shop owner gave to me."

<Shion>
"So it seems."
Shion replied softly, but clearly.

<Shion>
"Uncle Yoshirou gave those out as thanks for helping liven things up at Sunday's event.
 It seems he gave them to the four friends my sister brought along.
 So, you got the doll with the dress then. 

<Shion>
...What did you think?
 It was really cute, right?"
...As a man, there's no way I'd think it was cute.

<Shion>
"So, what did you do with the doll?"

<Keiichi>
"I wasn't really going to do anything with it,
 so I gave it to someone."
"To who?"
As Shion laughed, I could hear an audible click run through my head, like the piece of a jigsaw puzzle snapping into place...

<Master>
"Thank you very much for today, everyone.
 You made the event turn out great~!
 It's not much, but here's something extra for today~."

<Mion>
"Ah! Uncle Yoshirou!
 Isn't there a little something for me, too?"

<Satoko>
"My my my!!
 Quite an adorable one, is it not!?"
When Satoko and Rika-chan opened up the bag, there were cute little stuffed animals inside.

<Rena>
"Wow!!
 They're so... kyute~...!!
 Can I take them home?!
 I really can...!?"

<Keiichi>
"Which means, there's something for me, too?
 ...Woah.
 I got a pretty adorable one."
It was a stuffed toy wearing a beautiful dress.  One you'd use to play house.
Rena's eyes were glued to my stuffed doll! ...Satoko was the same, and Rika-chan too...!?
...I see.
It wasn't just Rena, Satoko, and Rika-chan.
...There was one other person who seemed jealous.

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!
 Kei-chan got the one that fits him the least!"
...Not wanting for her expression to give it away, she had said that to hide her embarrassment. 

<Keiichi>
"...Well, I guess it's cute and pretty... I can admit, it's adorable... but a doll with changeable clothes is... eh..."

<Mion>
"If you walked around with it, then you'd be treated like a weirdo starting tomorrow. Definitely!"
...Mion's usual teasing way of talking.
I looked around to see who I should give the doll to.
Mion was right in front of me.
Mion was the only one who hadn't received a present, so I thought about giving it to her.
 ...But I didn't.

<Rena>
"Huh!?!?
 You're giving it to me!?
 To Rena!?
 Thank you~~~!!!!!"
Turning away from Mion's covetous gaze, I gave the doll to Rena.
Mion's smile bore into my back.
 ...There was no way I couldn't have noticed.
Why did I not give it to Mion...?
Since Mion was the only one who didn't get anything, wouldn't it have just been standard practice to give it to her...?
At that time, I had noticed that something was wrong.
That's why I said it.

<Keiichi>
"Just protecting myself.
 ...If I didn't give it to Rena, then walking the streets at night would be scary."

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!!
 No doubt! No doubt!"

<Keiichi>
"I thought about giving it to Mion, but it just didn't feel right!"
Something dark flickered briefly in Mion's eyes, but at the time I didn't notice it.
I had thought to give it to Mion... Why didn't I?

<Mion>
"Heh heh heh, you know it!
 I sometimes wonder why I wasn't born a boy."
Mion herself had said that with a laugh, so I didn't realize that I had hurt her.

<Keiichi>
"That's right.
 Mion is more suited for cool things!
 So I think having you help out here was the right choice."
"...Huh?"
 Shion asked, probably thinking she misheard me.

<Keiichi>
"That uniform; it would never suit somebody like Mion.
 ...But if it's Shion, I think it works."

<Shion>
"Huh,
 ......You mean that
 ...Ummm..."
Shion, like Rena often does, spaced out and turned bright red.
Mion seemed really happy.
She seemed happy that I complimented Shion.
Saying that it didn't suit Mion, but that it suited Shion... Saying that it suited her seemed to make her happy.

<Keiichi>
"Ah, ummm... Mion's younger twin sister.
 She's got a different personality, but she's a dead ringer for Mion."

<Mion>
"That's right!
 We look similar, but our personalities are completely different!
 I'm very kind and thoughtful, but Shion has a cold and scary personality...!"

<Keiichi>
"...I think that when you guys were born, Shion got all the feminine aspects.
 Unlike Mion, she's a cute, cheerful girl."
Mion made a strange face that was both angry and happy at the same time.
It seemed she was happy that I said Shion was cute.
Sneaking a look inside the box, to say that she just put some of the leftovers inside would have been a lie. There was an elegant meal stuffed inside.

<Keiichi>
"I-Is it really okay!?
 There's not like a ton of hot sauce mixed in or anything, right!?"

<Shion>
"Geez.
 I'm not my sister. I wouldn't do that kind of thing.
 If you don't like it you don't have to force yourself...
 I'll just go home and eat it myself."
I'm not my sister.
 That was how she said it.
Shion was insistent that she wasn't Mion.
She was saying that she was Shion, and that I shouldn't think of her as Mion.
When Mion was Shion, it carried a special meaning.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan is mysterious, right?
 She's a girl, but it's like she's a guy."
That's what Rena said.

<Rena>
"But you see.
 Even that Mii-chan... is actually really feminine."

<Keiichi>
"...Rena.
 How much did Mion pay you exactly?"

<Rena>
"Thaat's noooot trueee~!
 Geez, I'm trying to have a serious conversation, you know? You know?"
Rena began to pout. Now probably wasn't the right time to joke around.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan is the club president, so she's trying hard to lead everybody.
 But she's really a very cute girl.
 I really don't want you to forget that, Keiichi-kun..."
There never was a riddle to begin with.
...Rena was saying the answer right from the beginning.

<Mion>
"...So then I... I don't know what's going on anymore..."

<Rena>
"...Yeah."

<Mion>
"...I know Kei-chan didn't mean anything wrong.
 ...At least, he didn't intend to."

<Rena>
"Yeah. ...Keiichi-kun isn't the type of person to hurt others.
 So there's no reason for you to feel hurt by this, Mii-chan."

<Mion>
"...Then, what was it?

<Mion>
...Frustration? Sadness?
 I don't know at all..."

<Rena>
"...Did you want it?
 The doll, I mean."

<Mion>
"........."

<Rena>
"It wouldn't really help even if I gave you the doll I got, would it."

<Mion>
"...You're right."

<Rena>
"How about this, Mii-chan?
 Try asking Keiichi-kun.
 ...You might be able solve the problem if you tackle it head on."

<Mion>
"T-There's no way I could do that...!"

<Rena>
"Is it too embarrassing to do that now...?"

<Mion>
"...I want to try again,
 as somebody other than Mion.

<Mion>
This time, I can be more honest with myself...

<Mion>
Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty fond of the relationship I have with Kei-chan.

<Mion>
This might be selfish... but one more time..."

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun will definitely notice."

<Mion>
"...I wonder if that's true."

<Rena>
"Rena will cheer you on too.
 ...So let's find a way for you to ease your sadness.
 Believe me.
 ...I won't let anything happen that'll make you cry, Mii-chan."

<Mion>
"......I'll believe.
 ...I'll believe."

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun will definitely come to understand.
 He'll say he's sorry for saying something so callous...
 Then he'll bring you to that store, and buy that doll for you as a present."

<Mion>
"......Yeah.
 ......Yeah."

<Rena>
"And then... Mii-chan, you'll say
 thank you.
 ...You can't fool around.
 Say it honestly."

<Mion>
"......Yeah.
 ...Geh...."

<Shion>
"...If I said I wanted it,
 ...Kei-chan... would you buy it for me...?"
Mion said it quietly, doing her best to quell her embarrassment.
I would have reflexively begun to lightly tease her to hide my embarrassment...
...but like Mion, I quelled that impulse.

<Keiichi>
"Okay, Mion.
 ...As thanks for everything until today, I'll buy you whichever one you want."
My voice cracked with the unfamiliar words.
In order to not lose to Mion trying her best, I tried my best as well.

<Shion>
"B-But, ...I'm not Mion, I'm Shion..."

<Keiichi>
"...Shion, then.
 I'll buy it for you, Shion."
Shion looked down. Red-faced, she pointed at the doll in the dress through the store window.

<Shion>
"Is...
 Is...
 ......Is it really okay?
 The one in the dress... is a little expensive, isn't it?"

<Keiichi>
"...This isn't a matter of price.
 This is a matter of feelings."

<Shion>
"When I... was saved by Kei-chan from those unsavory customers today... I was really happy.
 ...Even though my co-workers didn't save me, Kei-chan did.
 ...You grabbed me by the shoulder really firmly, right...? 

<Shion>
Right then... you were really cool.
 Even then... I was so embarrassed, I couldn't properly express my gratitude..."
I clamped my hand down on Shion's head, and ruffled her hair roughly.
 ...Like how I would to Rena and the others.
When I did that, Shion, like Rena would have, spaced out and blushed slightly...

<Keiichi>
"You don't have to think too hard about it.
 ...I should have just given it to you back then.
 If I did that, then everybody would have had a good laugh."
...Shion didn't respond.
She had turned bright red, like she was trying to hold back both laughter and tears.

<Keiichi>
"I'll go buy it for you right now.
 Wait right there."

<Shion>
"Ah... I-I'll go with you."
Saying that, she grabbed onto my arm once again.
 ...She wasn't trying to be stoic any more.

<Shion>
"...I think I know why... my sister likes you.
 .........Hey.
 ...Is it all right...
 ...If I start to like you a bit too, Kei-chan?"
The unfamiliar situation made my head start to spin...
 Whooaaaaaaa... wha-wha-wha-what am I doing...!
I had reached my limit.
Smiling wryly to hide my embarrassment, I dragged Shion into the store with me.

<Keiichi>
"E-E-E-Excuse me!!!
 I want to buy that doll in the dress that's in the window!!"
After a moment, I heard a voice of acknowledgement, and an apron-clad employee soon appeared.

<Mion>
"K-Kei-chan?
 And... why are you here!?!?"

<Shion>
"This has nothing to do with you.
 I'm on a date with Kei-chan right now."

<Mion>
"Huh...
 WhaaaaaAAAaaaaaa
...!?!?
 Wh-Wh-Why is Kei-chan...?"
E-Even if you ask why... I'd like to know the answer myself...
Mion looked at me with an expression of confusion and surprise...
 But that was the same with me!
...If she was there... then who was next to me!?!?

<Shion>
"I said it right at the beginning.
 I'm Shion Sonozaki.
 My sister's younger twin.
 Kei-chan, you even called me Shion, didn't you?"
'Shion,' saying that, pouted cutely...

<Mion>
"Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha-What is going on...
 Tell me... Shion...!"

<Shion>
"Not much.
 I was wondering what kind of person this Kei-chan you were so infatuated with was.
 So I happened to give him a ticket to the Dessert Festa. 

<Shion>
...There, when I was being bothered by all sorts of troublesome customers, Kei-chan gallantly appeared...
 ...and saved me by kicking them all to the curb
...
 or something like that."

<Mion>
""WhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAaaaa~~...!?!?""

Both Mion and I raised our voices pathetically, expressing our confusion to the utmost.

<Keiichi>
"...Mion...
 You phoned me...
 ...yesterday, right?"

<Mion>
"...I didn't.
 ...I have no idea what you're talking about..."

<Shion>
"I delivered that bento for you, didn't I, Kei-chan?
 That was me, right?
 Or was it my sister?
 The person known as Mion Sonozaki put together a bento, and bravely went to a boy's home to deliver it, maybe? 

<Shion>
Ohh, you're a lot bolder than you look, sis~!"
With a loud pop, a trail of smoke began to rise from Mion's head...

<Mion>
"No, I... I don't know I don't know...!"

<Shion>
"See, Kei-chan.
 My sister says she doesn't know.
 So everything up until yesterday was me, Shion Sonozaki.
 You might have thought it was my sister pretending to be me, but with this, there's no doubt, right?"
...I couldn't tell up from down at that moment...
If there was a mirror around, I could have seen my eyes go wide from the shock...

<Shion>
"Now, little miss shopkeeper.
 Could you wrap up that doll in the window?
 It's the first present from the person I've come to love, so make sure you tie it up nicely with a ribbon."
Mion, completely flustered, was being cornered by a sly-faced Shion.
...My brain had stopped working.

<Mion>
"Wai... wha...
 ...huh
 ......Kei-cha~...n..."

<Mion>
".........What... is going on..."

<Shion>
"Well, let's go!
 Kei-chan!
 It's already dark out, so I'll see you home.
 Sis, sorry, but could you phone the house in Okinomiya and have them send out a car?

<Shion>
Maybe a van that we can fit a bike into, please."
In contrast to Shion, who had glee written all over her face... Mion was an empty shell and looked like she could burst into tears at any moment.

<Mion>
"......Ooo......Kei-cha~...n..."
After that, Mion's grumblings were unrelenting...



[Watanagashi Ch.6]

The next day.
...It was a strange day, where Mion was desperate to regain her composure.
Every time our eyes met, she would say that she had something to do, or that she had to use the washroom, and run off.
Unable to just watch, Rena was taking care of her the entire time.

<Satoko>
"...Mion-san... She's acting totally strange today."

<Keiichi>
"I know the whole story... but it's hard to explain..."

<Rika>
"...There are times when girls are emotionally unstable.
 It's best to just leave her alone."
...Hm?
Turning around, I saw Rena calling me from the hallway.
 ...I wondered what it was.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, over here, over here."

<Keiichi>
"What is it, calling me over like this?
 Is it a secret?"

<Rena>
"Ummm...
 ...That is...
 ...It looks like it was a disaster.
 ...Ahahahahaha."

<Keiichi>
"Uh... Yea~h."

<Rena>
"Mii-chan seemed pretty broken, but I somehow got her working again."

<Keiichi>
"I'm surprised you managed it...
 How did you exactly...?"

<Rena>
"Same way I do with the television.
 Just come at it from a 45 degree angle and HIYAAAA!"
Saying that, she made a chopping motion.
...You know I can't tell if you're joking or not, right?

<Rena>
"She'll be fine by tomorrow.
 Also, there's something I want you to do, Keiichi-kun."

<Keiichi>
"...I didn't mean to do anything wrong, but I still feel guilty.
 ...I'm listening."

<Rena>
"Thanks.
 ...You see, Mii-chan is just going to pretend the last few days never happened."
Never happened, huh...
 ...I see... well, that's one way to run from it...

<Rena>
"So, you see...
 Keiichi-kun, could you pretend too?
 Then Mii-chan can go back to normal."

<Keiichi>
"J-Just doing something as simple as that... is it really going to be okay...?"

<Rena>
"Please, until Mii-chan gets her feelings in order, just go with it."

<Keiichi>
"...Okay...
 ...
I got it."
Even though I shouldn't have been at fault... for some reason I felt guilty.
The one at fault here was the one who knew about the entire situation and pretended to be Mion for an entire day: Shion...!!!
Ugh... but... she never once said that she was Mion...
 ...Ugh...
 What am I supposed to be angry at!?
Seeing me stomping the ground impatiently, Rena giggled.

<Rena>
"But Keiichi-kun, you knew as well.
 That Mii-chan has some cute things about her."
Rena talked in a calm voice as her hair rustled in the wind.

<Keiichi>
"......Yeah.
 I know that she'll never let it be boring."

<Rena>
"...Good."
Following this curt reply, Rena looked up at the sky and stretched.

<Rena>
"As long as you realize that, Keiichi-kun, these past few days will soon be nothing more than a story to laugh about."
Copying Rena, I also began to stretch as I looked at the sky.
The clear sky towered into the distance.

<Rena>
"There's no club activities or anything today.
 I'm sorry, Keiichi-kun, but just for today, can you go home by yourself?
 It'll all be back to normal by tomorrow, so just for today.
 ...Okay?"
If all it took for everything to go back to normal was to leave Mion alone for today, then it was an easy decision to make.

<Keiichi>
"Got it.
 ...I can't say it directly to Mion, so I'll say it to you.
 ...I still feel kind of guilty about it. So I want to apologize..."

<Rena>
"...Ah, no!
 The root of the problem was Keiichi-kun saying something insensitive, right?
 So if you learned anything from this, you need to look a bit into gaining a sense of delicacy."

<Keiichi>
"Right, right. I'll try."
That day, was the shortest day of my life.
Rena was talking to Mion while accompanying her around the entire time.
It looked like a really fun conversation, so I reflexively thought about joining in, but I had made a promise not to.
It seemed that Mion was also trying her best to ignore me.
...So likewise, I did my best to ignore her.
For the first time in a while, I ate lunch alone.
Mion and Rena ate theirs by themselves.
As I let out a sigh in my ashen mood, Rika-chan came over and patted me on the head.

<Rika>
"...Both Keiichi and Mii learned a whole lot."
I'd never say it like that.
 ...It made it sound like we were having romantic problems. I didn't like that one bit.
Hopefully the teacher wouldn't notice and call us to the staff room after school or something...

<Rika>
"...I'm sure that Keiichi will grow up to be a wonderful adult.
 ...*pat pat*"

<Keiichi>
"...Hmmm.
 ...Rika-chan is the studious type, so maybe you'll grow up to be an amazingly wonderful adult?"

<Rika>
"...Of course.
 When I grow up I'll be super amazing."

<Satoko>
"My, when I grow up I'll be an amazing lady, you know?"

<Keiichi>
"No matter how old you get, you'll still be a brat. You can put money on it."

<Satoko>
"Wha-Wha-Wha-What did you saaaaaaaaaAAaaaaay!?!?"
As Satoko snapped her fingers a washbasin fell from above, hitting me squarely in the head.


<Keiichi>
"Owwwwwww....
 What do you think you're doing SatokooooooooOooo!!!!"
*bang* *smash*
 *pinch* *squeeze*
 It was a day I could thoroughly appreciate the value of having friends.



[Watanagashi Ch.7]

Today was Saturday, so school ended in the blink of an eye.
It really felt good to go home with the sun so high in the sky.
On any other day, our club would have been up to mischief during our ample after-school time, but today Rika-chan had a rehearsal for tomorrow's Watanagashi to go to.

<Keiichi>
"How is that going, Rika-chan?
 Do you have it down in practice?"

<Rika>
"...I'll try harder than last year."

<Mion>
"You were so exhausted and sweaty after last year's ceremony."

<Satoko>
"She'll look far more fit for the role this year!
 Please, look forward to the fruits of her training."
The Watanagashi Festival everyone had been talking about was tomorrow, wasn't it?
The festival being in June felt a little early to me, but the onset of summer came quickly this year, so it fit the image of a 'summer festival' pretty well.

<Rika>
"...Okay, we'll be off, then."

<Satoko>
"Look forward to tomorrow!
 Good day to you all!"
Satoko and Rika-chan waved to us energetically, then left.

<Keiichi>
"You know, I never asked. Where is the festival happening, anyway?
 I don't remember there being anywhere around here that seemed suited for hosting one."

<Mion>
"They do it at the Furude Shrine.
 We went there for a walk one day, remember?
 It was that place with the really good view."
...Oh... Right, I remember.
There was a shrine all the way up on that hill, wasn't there? It seemed far too grand for Hinamizawa.

<Mion>
"There's a great meeting hall in the shrine too. The older people get together there and sing karaoke or practice calligraphy from time to time.
 It's more like a recreational facility than a simple shrine!"

<Keiichi>
"I see.
 I guess it makes sense that it looks so grand, then."

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, is your family going to help set up today?"

<Mion>
"Yep. We have male hands for that.
 Most of our relatives come from town to help."
Male hands, huh? ...Well, I mean, I have nothing to do at home today, so...

<Keiichi>
"Would it be a problem if I squirmed my way in there to help out too?"

<Mion>
"Huh?
 ...You want to help us, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"...Not if it'll bother you all.
 I was just kind of interested."
We had bon dances and other festivals in the town I used to live in, but I didn't even know where they took place, much less wanted to help.
 You could say that I had absolutely no connection to the region.
Having come to Hinamizawa, though, it really made me feel like this place was a home that I had returned to.
Before I knew it, I harbored a little interest in the small, community activity of preparing for a festival the day before.

<Rena>
"I wonder if you'll be able to, Keiichi-kun.
 There's a lot of building tents and setting up chairs.
 I hear it's pretty hard physical labor!"

<Keiichi>
"I mean, I wouldn't be doing it alone, right?
 The more hands we have, the faster it'll go."
Mion looked happy to hear that, but at the same time, her expression was complex, tinged with hesitation.
Rena gave her the last push for me.

<Rena>
"It's decided, then!
 You should go for it, Keiichi-kun.
 He's all yours, Mii-chan. Put him through the wringer!"

<Mion>
"Well, I can't argue with a recommendation from Rena.
 Okay then, go home first, put on some work clothes, and come to the shrine.
 Oh, and you might want to bring a towel to wipe your sweat, too."

<Keiichi>
"Got it!
 I may look scrawny, but I actually quite like breaking a sweat under the hot sun."

<Mion>
"Careful you don't hurt your back, okay?
 Right, enough of my old man spiel.
 ...I'll go to the shrine too, as soon as I've changed."

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, you do your best too!
 Bye-bye!"
Mion waved vigorously to us and left. As far as I could tell from her gallant, retreating figure, she seemed to have recovered from the weak state she had yesterday.

<Rena>
"Girls are quick to get over things.
 Mii-chan is already fine."

<Keiichi>
"Right.
 Her switching back to normal so cleanly really makes it easy for me to talk to her."

<Rena>
"It was kind of funny though, wasn't it?
 Kind of like Cinderella.
 Like, you can't meet her anymore once the magic wears off."
Rena began to giggle a fair bit in amusement.
 ...Did she like this sort of thing?
Incidentally, me going along with it gave me a weird, hard-to-describe feeling. Did I turn myself into a plaything, or did they do it for me?

<Keiichi>
"If you think it's so funny, then you should try pretending to be a different Rena, too."

<Rena>
"Yeah, that sounds like fun!
 Keiichi-kun, what kind of Rena would you want to meet?"

<Keiichi>
"One with a model class body line,
 the looks of an innocent young idol, and the patience to see to my every whim."

<Rena>
"I-I can't do that...!"

<Keiichi>
"She'd be great at cooking, and make me lunch, and come to see me in the mornings..."

<Rena>
"I do that already..."
I pull Rena's head into a tight grip, then start to pet it.

<Keiichi>
"You're Rena Ryuugu, right?
 Rena, not Reina!
 So you just stay as Rena forever, got it?"

<Rena>
"...Thanks!
 Have fun helping set up the festival~!"

<Keiichi>
"You got it!! Let's meet up tomorrow!!!"
I got changed right away, and, slinging a towel around my neck like Mion suggested, I set off for the shrine.
At the shrine... There were more people than you'd imagine even live in Hinamizawa there,
 all cordoning off areas and setting up tent frameworks, chatting amongst themselves as they did so.
...All right, where is Mion?
 The liveliness of the throng didn't make it easy to look for her.
I searched around as if I already worked there, and suddenly, the principal called out to me.

<Principal>
"Hm! If it isn't Maebara-kun. Interesting!!
 Have you come to help with the Watanagashi setup?"

<Keiichi>
"Um... uh, hello.
 Yes, I was just wondering if there was anything I could help with."

<Principal>
"How commendable your attitude is!!
 Feel free to sweat to your heart's content!
 Ga-ha-ha-ha!!"
Spurred on by the principal, I came upon a group of people setting up tents.

<Man>
"Oh, what's this? It's Maebara-chan.
 Did you come all this way to help us?"
I hadn't found Mion yet, but I supposed I'd just get in her way if I ran into her.

<Keiichi>
"Yeah!
 I'm here to help!!
 Just tell me where you need me!!"

<Man>
"You young ones have all the vitality~!
 Here, grab some work gloves.
 Ever built a tent before?"

<Keiichi>
"No, never!"
Delighting in teaching a new skill to someone younger, plenty of people happily taught me all sorts of things.

<Man>
"Okay, kid, go inside the tent and tie up just the cords for the top.
 After that we'll stand it up and tie the rest of them!"

<Keiichi>
"Butterfly knots are okay, right?
 ...There, and... there..."

<Man>
"All done?
 We're standing it up!!
 One, two, three!!"
What was once nothing more than a collapsed tent was raised on four splendid legs before my eyes in mere moments.
 ...Whoa...
 Seeing it put together like this is actually pretty moving!

<Man>
"Come on, no time to stare in wonder!!
 We've got a lot more to do!"

<Man>
"We packed the tents into the truck, so go get them from there.
 They're heavy, so take someone with you!"

<Keiichi>
"Nah, I'm good! I may look scrawny, but I'm actually pretty strong...!
 Whoa!?!?"
They look light enough, so I thought they were...but they're heavy!!

<Man>
"That's why I told you to have someone help!!
 Come on,"
said the man, lifting it up with a grunt and taking it away under his arm.
...Either I'm weak, or these old guys all have superhuman strength...

<Man>
"Let's go! You're the youngest one here, so we're going to make you sweat for it!!
 Do your best!!
 Beer after work is the best~!!"

<Keiichi>
"Umm, I'm a minor..."
Sweat dripped from my body.
 I had been fully and completely absorbed in helping them.
I would never have thought the cold barley tea from the women's society could taste this delicious.

<Senior>
"You're so young.
 Make sure you drink a lot."

<Keiichi>
"Th-Thank you..."
It was then that I realized a crowd had formed near the shrine a ways off.
When I took a closer look, I saw a girl dressed in shrine maiden garb and a handful of old men looking like they were preparing for the ceremony together.

<Keiichi>
"...Is that Rika-chan?
 Heeey!! Rika-chaaaan!!
 Do you beeeest!!"
I shouted, and it seemed like she heard me.
Rika-chan, positively exploding with vitality, answered with a smile.
The older guys with me watched Rika-chan as well, with distant gazes.

<Senior>
"Rika-chama is doing a great job."

<Senior>
"She seems far more used to this than she did last year!"
The old lady who gave me the tea clasped what looked like prayer beads in her hands and said,

<Senior>
"Rika-samaaa~, we thank you, we thank you..."
and just like that, began to respectfully pray to her.
...Huh?
I just remembered that they called it the Furude Shrine.
 ...Wasn't Rika-chan's full name Rika Furude?
The man standing next to me answered my question.

<Man>
"That's right.
 Rika-chama's Furude clan is ancient and honorable, and has worshipped Oyashiro-sama for generations."
...Huh.
 I'd always gotten the feeling she wasn't quite your average person, but it turned out she was from an esteemed family.

<Man>
"After her father, who was the shrine priest, died the year before last, she's really been doing her best to learn the rituals.
 ...I wish the priest could have been here to see how wonderfully she's grown up."

<Keiichi>
"What?
 Rika-chan's father passed away?"

<Man>
"Okay! Break time is over.
 Let's get the chairs we're not using back to the gym in Okinomiya.
 Maki-san, pull the truck around here and take a few people with you."

<Man>
"All right, Maebara-kun, let's get to work on one last job!"
Geh...!!
Y-You're gonna make me do more work...???
I can't tell if they know I'm a minor or not, but the older men all cheer me on, encouraging me to do my best and that the beer will be great.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, workin' hard, I see!"
I passed by Mion.
 She was carrying a big cardboard box. It looked like she was right in the middle of working as well.
Judging by the sweat seeping into her shirt, it seemed I wasn't the only one with his hands full.

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, I'm workin' my ass off!!
 You work hard, too!
 The beer's gonna be great!!"

<Mion>
"Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"
We were worked to the bone until the sun began to set and it started cooling off.
It was soon full-fledged night, and the clear sound of the higurashi eased the moderate pain I felt.
The older guys began their night-before drinking party in a tent a fair bit off, causing quite a ruckus.
The shrine grounds, on the other hand, had turned into a lonely road tickled by the cool evening breeze, despite being so festive just a little while ago.
 ...The wind felt good.
I leaned on one of the stone guardian dogs at the front of the shrine. I gave my legs a good stretch as I let my mind wander, and suddenly, a paper cup filled with barley tea was thrust before me.

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, great work!
 Here's some tea for you."

<Keiichi>
"You're so considerate~!
 Thanks, Mi—"
Her voice sounded exactly the same, but it felt somehow different.

<Keiichi>
"Wait, you're...!!"

<Shion>
"Heya! It's Shion.
 Don't go giving Mion all the credit.
 She isn't considerate at all. Don't get us confused, okay?"

<Keiichi>
"Sh-Shion, you little~!!
 Now that I've caught you, you're not getting away!"

<Shion>
"Ah-hahahaha!
 It was your mistake, Kei-chan.
 I've never said I was anyone other than Shion☆."

<Keiichi>
"Urgh... I guess I can't argue with that..."

<Shion>
"Hee-hee.
 ...That's right! You're no match for my older sister, so I can't let you be a match for me, either!
 Anyway, your tea!
 It's going to get warm."

<Keiichi>
"...Mgh."

<Shion>
"Come on, please cheer up.
 I'm trying to make it up to you with this tea."
...Well, she did come all the way here to give it to me.
 I guess I'll accept it.
I took the cup and downed it in one gulp.
...And then suddenly, aahhhhhhhhhh!!!
 I heard a loud shout and it got stuck in my throat...

<Keiichi>
"*cough* *cough* *hack*...!!
 Which one is it this time!?
 Is it the real Mion!?"

<Mion>
"Sh-Shioonnnn!!!
 Why are you hanging out with Kei-chan again!?"

<Shion>
"Because unlike you, I'm very considerate.
 Kei-chan was so sweaty. I couldn't leave him alone, so I brought him some tea.

<Shion>
...By the way, why are you holding two cups of tea?"
Mion's face went bright red, and she tried to hide the paper cups behind her back.

<Mion>
"Ah, er, well...
 This is...!"

<Shion>
"There's no way you, such a rough, timid, good sister of mine would ever briskly bring a male classmate tea, is there?
 So what are they?
 What are those two cups of tea?"

<Mion>
"These are...
 Well...
 Umm...
 Ummmm...
 Right!
 I was just so thirsty... I figured I'd drink two...!"

<Shion>
"Ahahahaha, that's so like you.
 Come on! Chug! Chug!"
As Shion cheered at her, Mion downed both the cups of tea, one after the other.

<Mion>
"Urgh, *cough* *cough*...!!"

<Shion>
"What a fabulous drink that was! I expected nothing less from you.
 Kei-chan, you give her a hand too."
Wait... Suddenly this situation has gotten unbelievable.
 ...Mion doesn't usually get manipulated so easily like that...
 I've known for a while now, but... Shion is terrifying.

<Keiichi>
"......Mion, ...You can't hold your own against Shion?"

<Mion>
"I hate her!
 And lately I hate her even more~!"
Just then, I heard the snap of a camera shutter.

<Tomitake>
"Good evening.
 The festival is coming up tomorrow!
 Thanks for all your hard work setting it up today."

<Woman>
"Good evening.
 ...Oh, Shion-chan?
 It's quite unusual for you to come here."

<Mion>
"Oh, hey, it's Tomitake and Takano-san!"

<Shion>
"Good evening. It's been a while, hasn't it?"

<Tomitake>
"Hey there, Keiichi-kun.
 You really did a bang-up job today! I'm impressed."

<Keiichi>
"It was nothing... Do you know Shion, too?"

<Tomitake>
"Ha ha ha! Indeed I do.
 I come every year, after all.
 Still, if they changed hair styles, I still wouldn't be able to tell them apart."

<Mion>
"Don't lump me in with someone like her."

<Keiichi>
"Ah, err..."

<Woman>
"Good evening. Do you recognize me...?"

<Keiichi>
"............I'm sorry, but I don't."

<Mion>
"She's Miyo Takano-san.
 Do you remember when you were at the doctor's office when you still had a cold, Kei-chan?
 Miyo-san is one of the nurses who works there."

<Takano>
"Call me Takano.
 I'm pleased to meet you.
 Tell me when you're coming in for treatment. I'll prepare a huge needle for you."

<Keiichi>
"...That's very thoughtful of you..."
Tomitake-san seemed to be quite entertained at the Sonozaki twins being in the same place, and he took picture after picture.

<Tomitake>
"Wow, I'd heard you two were identical twins, but it really is quite something to see you side-by-side.
 You really do look exactly alike!"

<Shion>
"We're not just alike on the outside! See, our underwear matches, too☆."

<Mion>
"Gyaahhhhhhh! You idiot, what the heck are you doing!!?"
...Things have never been as lively as when the two of them are together.
I'd thought they were exactly the same at first, but I've started to get a handle on which one is which.
Mion is Mion, and Shion... well, she seems a far better actor than Mion was.
In the first place, somebody that could spurn Mion so easily wouldn't have shown such weakness to those lardbuckets at Angel Mort!
If that was the case, then that cowardly behavior from that day was all... it was all a complete act!

<Takano>
"They were even more alike when they were little.
 I heard even their parents had a hard time telling which was which."

<Keiichi>
"......That's really easy to imagine.
 ...I totally understand what they must have gone through."
Takano gave me kind of an odd look, but explaining would have been a pain so I didn't bother.

<Mion>
"Tomitake, are you going straight back to Tokyo after you get your pictures of the festival?"

<Tomitake>
"Yep. Though I would rather just stay here forever.
 Silly adult things, that's all."

<Shion>
"I hope your photos win a fabulous prize soon. I've been praying for it!"

<Tomitake>
"Thanks!
 Next time I come, I'll bring the pictures I took of you all today."

<Takano>
"Maebara-kun, you did a lot of work today.
 You must be tired from all the physical labor you're not used to."

<Keiichi>
"Huh? Well... I'm tired, but it was still pretty fun."

<Takano>
"Ah, youth. I'm so jealous."
Takano-san smiled with an adult elegance that no one in my circle of friends possessed.
The wind caught her hair... She gives off an intelligent beauty.

<Ooishi>
"Oh, why, hello, everyone."
It seemed like our merry crowd was standing out—this time, an overweight older man addressed us.
...And again, it was someone I thought I knew.
 If I recall correctly... he's a policeman, isn't he?

<Takano>
"Oh, Ooishi-san.
 Good evening.
 Doing a preliminary security inspection for tomorrow?"

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha.
 Something like that.
 Oh? If it isn't Tomitake-kun.
 It's certainly been a while!"

<Tomitake>
"I'm honored you remembered my name."

<Ooishi>
"You really do love Hinamizawa, don't you?

<Ooishi>
The apartments around here are far cheaper than the ones in Tokyo.
 You should just move here and get it over with.
 I know a realtor I can introduce you to."

<Tomitake>
"I appreciate the thought.
 I'd very much like to follow up on that."

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha!
 All right, everyone, have a good year.
 And happy new year to the Sonozaki twins, too."

<Shion>
"Happy new year, Detective Ooishi.
 ......We appreciate your work.
 We'd like to end this year's festival with the least amount of inconvenience possible."

<Ooishi>
"That's pretty strict on me.
 ...Na-ha-ha-ha-ha."
Detective Ooishi left us with a low laugh and headed off to talk to some police officers standing a ways away.
...I gave Mion a glance, and saw her making an annoyed face, as if she were glaring bullets at someone she hated.

<Takano>
"......Yeah.
 It'd be nice if the police didn't have anything to do during Watanagashi this year."

<Tomitake>
"Ah-ha-ha-ha.
 You like this place too, don't you?"

<Takano>
"Oh, you mean to say you dislike it, Jirou-san?
 ...I quite enjoy such fantastic stories, you know.
 Especially with the times being so dry and uninteresting."

<Tomitake>
"The curse of Oyashiro-sama, you mean?"

Curse—Tomitake-san used a troubling word.
Then, suddenly, someone tugged on my arm.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan,
 I'm pretty hungry.
 Wanna go to the tent with the drinks and have some candy and sweets?"

<Keiichi>
"Hmm... I'm up for that.
 I've gotten a little hungry as well."

<Mion>
"Okay, let's go...!"
A moment later, Shion said something to Takano and Tomitake that stung my ears and gave me a start.

<Shion>
"I wonder who will die and who will disappear this year."
I pulled back from Mion's grip and stopped abruptly.

<Keiichi>
"Shion...
 What did she just say?"

<Mion>
"....................."
It felt like the air around us dried out all of a sudden.

<Mion>
"Let's go, Kei-chan.
 ...They're talking about something silly anyway."

<Shion>
"......You still haven't told Kei-chan?"

<Mion>
"I make it a point not to spread stories like that."
Shion's cold and quiet tone and Mion's harsh voice were quite the contrast.

<Keiichi>
"...Hey, wait, hold on. What are you talking about...?
 If you know something, then tell me.
 It doesn't feel right being the only one left out, you know...?"
I don't understand this. Someone explain it to me.
 ......However, Mion didn't seem to be at all willing to grant my request.
She squeezed my hand in hers a bit, but when she realized I would hold my ground on this topic, she let go.

<Mion>
"...I'm gonna go to the drinking tent first then.
 If you don't come soon, Kei-chan, there won't be any left for you!"

<Keiichi>
"Argh, I get it already!
 I'll be there soon."
Mion left, trotting towards a particularly noisy tent on the other side of the shrine grounds.
Before she got there, she stopped and turned back around.
I showed no signs of going after her, though, so she ran off.

<Tomitake>
"I could tell you if you haven't heard, I suppose...
 But it might be smarter not to ask, and go with her to eat dessert."
...Hey, now. You've already gotten my full attention here. I'm not going to leave without asking at this point.

<Shion>
"I think Kei-chan has the right to hear this too.
 ......My sister was just stealing that from you."
Shion's voice was bristling with thorns, as if somehow blaming Mion.

<Keiichi>
"...What on earth are you talking about?
 I don't really like people acting so self-important."
Takano-san, realizing how prepared I was, looked across the group. After confirming that there were no objections, she opened her mouth.

<Takano>
"Do you believe in curses, Maebara-kun?"

<Keiichi>
"Curses...?
 ......I think they're interesting, but I don't really..."
I felt their cynical stares, and winced.
...It was like they were telling me it was stranger not to believe in curses...

<Shion>
"You're not wrong, Kei-chan.
 Curses are just superstition.
 It's only natural that you wouldn't believe in them."

<Takano>
"...Mm-hmm.
 Besides, you can take all the time you need to decide whether to believe in curses after you've heard us through,"
said Takano-san, giving a little smile.
They're trying to scare me.
 ...At least, that's what it feels like.

<Tomitake>
"All right... I'll start.
 Keiichi-kun, do you know about the Hinamizawa Dam Project?"
Oh, yeah. The other day, at Angel Mort, Shion—or Mion, rather—told me all about it.

<Keiichi>
"You mean the plan for the giant dam that would flood all of Hinamizawa, right?"

<Tomitake>
"That's right.
 Residents of the town banded together to fight it, and a fierce battle with the government unfolded."
I've heard that, too.
...The entire village united, using all the power at their disposal—mass media, political influence, and other things—and fought the country. The way Mion described it made it sound like a boast.

<Tomitake>
"...Oh, you know quite a bit about it.
 Yes, you're right.
 It's practically an epic tale, how just a thousand or so villagers banded together and rejected the government's plans."

<Shion>
"Did you hear this from my sister?
 She likes those kinds of 'epics,' you know."

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah.
 She told me."

<Tomitake>
"There was, however, an office for the Hinamizawa residents' opposition faction.
 It was this shrine."

<Takano>
"You know the assembly hall? That's where it used to be.
 Now that the whole thing is over, the senior citizens just use it for group activities. At the time, though, it was their last bastion."
Takano-san explained this, pointing a finger towards the assembly hall. I had been carrying things in and out of there all day.
...I mean, I would understand if they put an office like that in the mayor's house or something.
 But having an office on shrine grounds made it feel kind of like a base camp for Sengoku Period warriors.

<Tomitake>
"That was basically the mindset, though.
 Placing the main force in the shrine dedicated to Oyashiro-sama, Hinamizawa's guardian deity, was like a prayer for victory."
Oyashiro-sama...
That was definitely it.
They mentioned Oyashiro-sama's curse before.
 Is it the same Oyashiro-sama?

<Tomitake>
"Do you know about Oyashiro-sama, Keiichi-kun?
 It's the name of the god worshipped at this shrine.
 It's said that he protects all of Hinamizawa."

<Keiichi>
"Well...
 I don't really know much about him."

<Tomitake>
"I see. I think Takano-san knows more about the rest.
 Tag, you're it."

<Takano>
"Well, that is generally the whole story.

<Takano>
Oyashiro-sama is the ancient god passed down in Hinamizawa, and the villagers say he has been protecting this sanctuary from the poisons of the outside world."
So essentially, he's a basic, standard guardian deity.
I guess you can find that sort of god anywhere you go.

<Takano>
"There's research into whether worshipping Oyashiro-sama is a manifestation of a kind of elitism, too.
 What I mean is that the worshippers might think of themselves as 'chosen people.'"
...Believing yourself "chosen"—a nationalistic belief that you are part of a superior race, or that you're a special clan chosen by the gods.
They believe that they're a superior clan, so they believe strongly in cooperating with others, but they also end up being exclusionary towards other clans.
...I won't go into too much detail, but it's the sort of national and religious ideas that lead to war.
 Of course, that goes for Japan, too.

<Takano>
"A long time ago, the people of Hinamizawa strongly believed themselves different from humans, that they were above them.

<Takano>
They believed that interaction with the lower world would sully their souls.

<Takano>
......So everyone believed that if one from the lower world came to the village, they would be sullied and suffer the wrath of Oyashiro-sama. Apparently that kept everyone away."

<Tomitake>
"Villages that hate outsiders come up all the time in mystery novels.
 This was once a classic example of a xenophobic village."

<Shion>
"...Well, they'll deny it to preserve their pride. It was all a long time ago, after all!
 Things are different now."
Shion followed up quickly, having sensed the thorns in Tomitake-san's words.
 ...Tomitake-san, embarrassed at what he said, scratched at his head.
Hmm...
...So this shrine worships Oyashiro-sama, thinks of Hinamizawa as holy ground, and it's a symbol of their traditional hatred of the outside world.

<Keiichi>
"...I get it.
 So that's why they chose the shrine of Hinamizawa's guardian spirit as their base of operations—to resist the sullied dam construction project that came from the outside."
"Correct,"
 smiled Takano, pleased.
 ...She must dislike stupid people.

<Tomitake>
"Superstition, every last bit of it.
 The villagers gave everything, desperate to oppose the dam construction.
 ......And right in the midst of it...
 the incident drove home the finishing blow."
...Oyashiro-sama's
 curse.

<Shion>
"The person managing the construction site of the Hinamizawa Dam was murdered.
 Four years ago, I believe?
 It took the newspapers by storm. Do you remember it?"

<Keiichi>
"Uhh... No, not really..."

<Tomitake>
"The construction manager was murdered and dismembered."
...Such a gruesome incident...
But...it was just that—an incident.
A person caused the incident, after all. Should they really put it down to the curse...?

<Takano>
"Then the following year,
 the man who had organized Hinamizawa's group of dam proponents...
 He fell from a cliff while on vacation and died.
 Apparently, it was an accident."

<Tomitake>
"Of course, most of Hinamizawa was hostile towards him.
 The police were all over the case as if it were a homicide, but in the end, it was judged to have been an accident."
...Now it's an accident.
...This is the most curse-like one, but it's still far-fetched.

<Takano>
"And then, on the next year...
 This time, the priest of this shrine contracted an unknown illness and suddenly died."

<Shion>
"...This may sound a little rude, but the old priest was kind of a wait-and-see type.
 The whole village was in an uproar about the dam, but he just kind of didn't seem to want to bother.

<Shion>
The shrine was the symbol of the opposition movement, and its priest—well, his attitude worked against him. 

<Shion>
...The villagers at the time had hoped for a leader, but their hopes were betrayed. Some people were apparently pretty angry, too.

<Shion>
So at the time, all the older people were like:
 'This is Oyashiro-sama's curse.'
 That's what they said."
......It did seem like every year, dam-related people the village had resentment towards were dying. It was pretty creepy.

<Tomitake>
"Oh, and also...
 It's interesting. All of these incidents and accidents always happen on the night of the Watanagashi Festival."

<Keiichi>
"...What...!?"

<Takano>
"See? ...Starting to sound like a curse now, isn't it?"

<Tomitake>
"Then the year after that...
 In other words, last year.
 The sister-in-law of the man who was the leader of the dam proponents—the one who accidentally died—was discovered dead, having been beaten to death.

<Tomitake>
Of course, they caught that criminal."

<Takano>
"See?
 Really seems like a curse, huh?"
...Four years in a row.
...Each one of the incidents and accidents were relatively commonplace,
 but every single one of them happening on the night of the festival worshipping Oyashiro-sama? That's not normal.

<Shion>
"...The old folks have been blindly accepting Oyashiro-sama's curse because of the incidents these past few years...
 Even younger people, too. At first they thought it was stupid, but now nobody makes fun of it."
Yeah, I can see where she's coming from.
...Even me. Even if I didn't think there was a curse at all, thinking about all the incidents like this makes me feel like... maybe it's real?

<Tomitake>
"For example, just look at the preparations for the festival you were doing today.

<Tomitake>
Everything might have gone crazy during the battle against the dam, but just a few years ago, the Watanagashi Festival was never this well-attended."

<Shion>
"Well... I guess you're right.
 If we didn't have Oyashiro-sama to talk about, we wouldn't all be coming to a festival like this, huh?

<Shion>
There's a lot of people who say that infidels might be punished, so they really need to go to Oyashiro-sama's festival."
Shion nodded as if she were mocking herself.

<Tomitake>
"So how about now?
 Keiichi-kun... You're starting to get the feeling that maybe, just maybe, the curse is real, aren't you?"
......I mean... You can't just laugh off people related to the dam construction project all dying like that.
If even I feel like this now, then the more superstitious members of the village must feel stronger than that.

<Keiichi>
"......Well, I mean...
 ...I still don't think there's a curse.
 I can understand those that believe there is, though."

<Shion>
"Wow, Kei-chan!
 You can really keep a cool head about this."
Shion grinned, realizing I'd rejected the curse.

<Takano>
"If it's neither a curse nor a coincidence...
 then...
 what should we make of these incidents?"
Takano-san said, smiling playfully, as if posing a riddle.
Neither a curse, nor a coincidence...
But every year, someone dies.
...What should we make of that, then...?
Tomitake-san, catching on to the fact that I had no idea what to make of it, opened his mouth and came to my aid.

<Tomitake>
"......Takano-san is suggesting that it might be the work of real people."
Eh!?
 ...Simple process of elimination would have gotten me there. I was a little taken aback at not having realized the answer immediately.

<Takano>
"Well, think about it.
 If it's neither a curse nor coincidence, then people must be willingly carrying it out. It's the only explanation, right?"
Takano-san pressed on. I smiled bitterly in spite of myself.
Here I was just a few minutes ago, thinking the very concept of a curse was absolutely absurd.
 When she suggested it was someone's doing, I ended up thinking... there wasn't any way it could be a person.
But Takano-san was right.
It was either a curse or it was a person's doing.
If unrealistic things like curses didn't exist... then the obvious next step would be to start thinking it was people behind it.
...But if that was the case...
I glanced at Shion...

<Shion>
"...If the culprit is a person, then they'd have to be someone from Hinamizawa.
 That's what the police officer, Ooishi-san, thinks right now, too."

<Keiichi>
"......H-Hey, wait...
 That can't... be..."
I thought I now knew the reason Mion didn't want to talk about this.
...If Oyashiro-sama's curse really existed... then that's fine.
 It would be divine judgment for the dam project business.
However... if Oyashiro-sama's curse didn't exist (which it obviously didn't)... then the culprit would most likely be someone from Hinamizawa.
The villagers had worked desperately to oppose the dam construction project...
I knew they had used all sorts of methods to fight against it.
......If one of those methods was...
 ...maybe......

<Shion>
"People whisper that Oyashiro-sama's curse could be the doing of a secret group in the dam resistance movement."
...Shion dryly put words to my exact thoughts.
Of course, I didn't expect it.
...She was from Hinamizawa, so I didn't think she'd come out and say it herself.

<Shion>
"...If you calm down and think about it, anyone would come to the same conclusion.
 There wouldn't be a motive for anyone but people who benefit from opposing the dam project, right?"

<Keiichi>
"I-I guess that's true..."
Admitting to the existence of a darker side of the dam conflict would be rude to Mion, who spoke of it so highly.
So I couldn't just accept Shion's seemingly-logical viewpoint...

<Shion>
"One more thing... the police probably don't know this.
 ...There's proof that someone from Hinamizawa committed these crimes, and the people of Hinamizawa know it."

<Keiichi>
"...Eh? ...What!?"
Shion rebukes me to keep my voice down.

<Keiichi>
"...S-Sorry...
 ......but, this proof...
 What is it...?"

<Shion>
"It's the fact that one person dies, and one more person disappears."
One more person... disappears.
......Did that mean that someone besides the one who died from the curse was a sacrifice...?

<Keiichi>
"What do you mean by 'disappear'...?
 ...They just vanish and you never see them again?"

<Shion>
"That's right.
 Suddenly and without a trace."
As she spoke, Shion pretended to do a trick with her hands like she were making a magician's hat disappear.
One dies a mysterious death, and one disappears, never to be seen again.
 ......A strange vanishing act.
But then why... How does that equate to someone from Hinamizawa being the culprit...?

<Takano>
"Well, actually...
 Hinamizawa has this one reeeeally old legend.
 ...It's about how people offer sacrifices to Oyashiro-sama to calm his wrath."

<Keiichi>
"S-Sacrifices...!?"

<Takano>
"Yes.
 They say they used to wrap a living person up in a bamboo mat and let them slowly sink down into a bottomless swamp."
Takano-san, though explaining something pretty terrible... has a look of glee on her face as she did so.

<Takano>
"As far as I can glean from the literature, it actually took three days and three nights for them to sink.
 ...See? Even people a long time ago liked symbolism.

<Takano>
As the body sunk, Oyashiro-sama's anger would be quelled.
 Both were submerged into the deep.
 ...Heeheehee."
Takano-san was the only one laughing at this. Was she telling a joke or something?
Shion didn't move to deny it, but I felt a difference in temperature between her cool expression and Takano-san's.

<Shion>
"This whole conversation... Well, I think you can imagine after hearing it, but it's the secret history of Hinamizawa.
 Everyone who has been in Hinamizawa for a long time knows it, but they don't talk about it."

<Tomitake>
"Takano-san's not from here, but she knows quite a lot.
 She really likes local history, folk legends... stuff like that.
 She learned about it all by herself, too."

<Takano>
"I'm really not all that amazing.
 Just curious, that's all.
 ...Like a child.
 I just want to see scary things for the fun of it."
Tomitake-san laughed, a little bit embarrassed.

<Keiichi>
"W-Wait a minute.
 ...What does that mean? The other person who disappears during the incidents... You're saying they're offered as a sacrifice!?"
"Yeah."
Shion answers in one word before anyone else can speak.
Someone dies, then someone disappears.

<Tomitake>
"...Hmm...
 Well, whether they actually get sacrificed or not is a different issue.
 But every time something happened in the past, one person died, and one other person disappeared.

<Tomitake>
...For example, the first one, where the dam site manager was killed. Apparently one of the people responsible for that still hasn't been arrested."

<Keiichi>
"...Couldn't that... couldn't that just mean he managed to get away?
 I don't see why we should treat him as a sacrifice..."

<Tomitake>
"Well, that's basically what I think, too.
 ...There was also the year after that, with the leader of the dam proponents."

<Keiichi>
"Err... You said he fell from a cliff and died while on vacation, right?"

<Takano>
"Apparently his wife fell as well.
 The police investigated fervently, but they were never able to find the wife's corpse."

<Takano>
"The river under the cliff was actually pretty high at the time, though.
 She could have just been buried under the sand at the bottom of some lake downstream or something."
The perpetrator of a dismemberment like that wouldn't want to be caught, so they'd be desperate to run away and hide, too.
I thought I'd heard about cases where the corpse wouldn't surface after the person drowned in a swelled river like that.
...She vanished because of an unfortunate accident, but I still didn't see the connection to sacrifices...
......If you took each of the past incidents in turn, none of the disappearances evoked that terrifying of an image.

<Shion>
"The year after that, with the priest suddenly falling ill and dying, is much clearer.
 His wife left a suicide note. 

<Shion>
They found it in their house the night the priest died. It said something along the lines of her quelling Oyashiro-sama's wrath through her death."
......The curse... It seems to turn up in this one, though...

<Tomitake>
"Well, we may never know the truth of the matter.

<Tomitake>
The swamp the wife drowned herself in was the giant, bottomless one Takano mentioned before.
 The police investigated it, but all they could find were several of her possessions—they never found the corpse. 

<Tomitake>
The police suspect it was a faked suicide, and they're still investigating it now."
......Someone dies every year, and in the same way, someone goes missing every year.
Is she trying to tell me that everyone who vanished was kidnapped by some extremely efficient means and dumped into the bottomless swamp, still alive, and drowned to death...?
But a curse? That's unbelievable in its own right.

<Tomitake>
"And the next year... what was it, the dam proponent's sister-in-law?
 She was killed."
 So... at that time, someone else... 'vanished'?

<Shion>
"Someone did disappear.
 ...It was a boy around my age named Satoshi Houjou.
 He's the nephew by marriage of the woman killed."
Shion cut in with a slightly strong tone of voice.
...She knew the boy who had disappeared pretty well... At least, that's the vibe I was getting.

<Takano>
"Well, that about sums everything up.
 One person always dies, and one person always suddenly disappears."
...Leaving the suddenness aside...
...The fact was that each incident involved one person disappearing.

<Keiichi>
"Err... So, that means...
 The first person who dies is because of Oyashiro-sama's curse, and the second person who vanishes is because the villagers sacrifice them? Is that it...!?"

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, there is no curse.

<Shion>
......Somebody kills the first person under the guise of the curse, and someone takes away the second person to be a sacrifice."

<Keiichi>
"But, Shion, that means... That means the criminal is in the village!"

<Shion>
"That's what I've been guessing from the start.
 ...It's pretty shocking, though, you know? 

<Shion>
We live in the Showa period. It's kinda hard to believe people are committing murder like it's nothing, using some ancient justifications, huh?"
...It didn't have anything to do with our discussion... but I got the feeling that maybe Shion didn't like Hinamizawa very much.
Mion enjoyed talking about Hinamizawa and its 'epic tales.'
So she had avoided talking about Oyashiro-sama's curse, which didn't paint Hinamizawa in a good light no matter how you looked at it.
She was trying not to give me a bad impression of the village, so she didn't say anything.
...Shion, on the other hand, was somehow different.
She wasn't rejecting the concept of a curse to purge Hinamizawa of this bad impression, but rather because she strongly believed that a member of the village was the criminal behind this.
...Her conviction seemed a bit removed from the tight sense of community held by the people of Hinamizawa.
Once upon a time, they looked so alike you could mistake one for the other
 ...but talking to her now, I was getting a powerful feeling that Shion had a completely different personality than Mion.

<Keiichi>
"......Then everyone else... they all think someone from Hinamizawa did it, right...?"
Neither Shion nor Takano-san answered that.
The deafening silence told me all that needed to be said...

<Keiichi>
"...Then let me ask another question.
 If someone from Hinamizawa is the culprit, then who is it?"
Neither Shion nor Takano-san had a reply to that question, either.
...Though it may have been rude to ask, I had hoped they wouldn't have one.
...The reason I asked was to argue that their explanation that the culprit was from Hinamizawa was nothing more than one possibility.
Shion caught on to my plan. She gave a pained smile at my petty spite and opened her mouth to speak.

<Shion>
"All I said really just amounts to circumstantial evidence, anyway.
 If any of us knew who it really was, we'd have gotten them into police hands already."
As would anybody.
 ......Then what about Takano-san?
She, too, smiled dryly as Shion had and opened her own mouth.

<Takano>
"...Umm, well.
 I'd like to clear one thing up.
 I'm not a detective or anything, all right?
 In all honesty, I'm not really interested in who the culprit is."

<Tomitake>
"Ahahahahaha. ...Takano-san, you sure are a handful."
Tomitake-san gives a bitter laugh at her surprising opinion on the matter.

<Takano>
"You see...
 I just like cruel and atrocious ancient traditions and fairy tales.
 I only enjoy them from a curious onlooker's perspective.

<Takano>
So even for this string of incidents, it's not so much finding out who the culprit is, but enjoying thinking about how the old traditions displayed by the incidents themselves still seems to have some pretty deep roots around here..."
Though she described herself as nothing more than a curious onlooker, her smile was as sharp as the tip of a blade... Women like her felt very strange and a little scary to me.
...Maybe it's just that I was in fearful awe of the person whose emotions I couldn't comprehend.

<Shion>
"Well, I don't think any of this is 'interesting' at all.
 The Watanagashi Festival is coming up tomorrow, but I don't want anyone to die, or disappear."

<Keiichi>
"...Tomorrow, huh......"
That's right.
 ...It had completely slipped my mind.
...The string of murder incidents people attributed to Oyashiro-sama's curse—it wasn't over.
If last year's incident wasn't the end, then tomorrow night at the festival... would someone die, and someone disappear...?

<Takano>
"I do wonder who will die tomorrow and who will disappear, though."
Takano-san said, running a comb through her hair with elegant movements... with a thin smile and a voice that nearly made me shudder.
She almost looked like she was enjoying the thought of the incidents that could happen tomorrow...
Then, out of the blue, we heard a loud round of applause. They seemed to be ending the drinking party early.
Right, I was making Mion wait this whole time, wasn't I?
 ...I should go back to her soon...

<Tomitake>
"You're teasing the kid too much, Takano-san.
 Now Keiichi-kun thinks it's all true."

<Takano>
"Heehee. I apologize.
 It's that bad habit of mine again..."
said Takano-san, sticking out her tongue bashfully. The strangeness in her expression was nowhere to be found.

<Tomitake>
"When Takano-san sees an innocent child like you, she can't help wanting to poke fun at them. It's a real bad habit.
 Keiichi-kun, you listen to everything so earnestly that she ended up getting carried away."
Unlike Takano-san, Tomitake-san seemed like a totally normal person with common sense.
They were apologizing after realizing what kind of impression they'd given me.

<Tomitake>
"The stuff Takano-san just said is all fiction.
 If it made you harbor any bad impressions about Hinamizawa, then we apologize for that."

<Takano>
"...Geez, Jirou-san."

<Tomitake>
"You apologize too, Takano-san.
 Tell him you're sorry for scaring him!"
Takano-san and Tomitake-san were arguing and messing around now...
 The strained air around us had already dissipated.

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, you should get going soon, too.
 Mion is the jealous type.
 If she sees me she'll probably start a fight, so I'll just be going home."

<Keiichi>
"Really?
 Then I'll go see what Mion's doing and apologize for making her wait, I guess..."

<Tomitake>
"Sorry for being such a nuisance, Keiichi-kun.
 Could you tell Mion-chan we're sorry for borrowing you for so long?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, yes. I don't think telling her will make her feel any better, but sure."
Tomitake-san and Takano-san, standing next to each other, both began to chuckle.

<Shion>
"Okay then, Kei-chan.
 ...Let's try and run into each other at tomorrow's festival!"

<Keiichi>
"We'll see each other.
 I mean, it's us we're talking about, after all.
 We'll be making so much trouble it'll be hard for you not to find us."
Shion and I said our goodbyes to Tomitake-san and Takano-san.
...Before we could leave, Takano-san called out to us.

<Takano>
"Thanks for listening so earnestly to what I had to say.
 You're just so good at listening. I had a great time talking to you."

<Keiichi>
"Good at listening...? No, not at all..."
I was just in a state of perpetual bewilderment from all the shocking topics being thrown at me one after another.

<Takano>
"Did you like my story today?"

<Keiichi>
"......Well... It was pretty interesting."

<Takano>
"Then I'll tell you some more sometime, okay?
 There's a lot of pretty interesting legends and fairy tales about Hinamizawa.
 Of course, a lot of strange and creepy ones, too. 

<Takano>
I'll choose a bunch of my favorites and tell you about them."
I was kind of happy, but kind of worried...
 I can't help but smile dryly and scratch at my head.

<Tomitake>
"Keiichi-kun, you can go now.
 Takano-san is just messing with you."
They say goodbye again and run off.
I heard Tomitake-san call out behind him in a clear voice that we would see each other at the festival tomorrow.
When I went to the tent Mion was waiting for me in... she was nowhere to be found.
I made her wait so long... Maybe she got mad and went home...
After asking some adults passing by, I heard that she went home, talking to some relatives.
...Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
But my regret for having made Mion wait...
...wasn't enough to triumph over the impression Takano-san and Shion's uncanny story left on me.
Serial murder incidents had happened four years in a row.
...Would tomorrow's events make this the fifth?
And... the possibility that someone from Hinamizawa was carrying this all out under the guise of the curse.
The queer tradition of ritual sacrifice, entirely unbecoming of the Showa period we lived in.
I regretted it a little, though it was too late.
...If none of those creepy stories had anything to do with me...
 ...then I should have let Mion pull me away from that crowd.
 I felt a little ashamed about letting my cheap curiosity get the better of me......



[Watanagashi Ch.8]


<Rena>
"Wah!
 It's Keiichi-kun! Good morning! Good morning!"
Rena was ecstatically waving her arms at me, already brimming with energy.

<Keiichi>
"What do you mean 'good morning'? It's already evening!
 Just say 'hello' or something."

<Rena>
"But, but... This is the first time I've seen you today, so I think 'good morning' is right. It's right."

<Keiichi>
"...I got it, I got it.
 Okay, then good morning it is. Good morning, Rena."
I grabbed Rena's head and rubbed it with my hand.
 She squirmed, reveling in the motion like a cat.

<Mion>
"Heya, Kei-chan!
 Sorry about yesterday. I left without telling you."

<Keiichi>
"Ah... No, it's my fault.
 Sorry for making you wait so long."

<Rena>
"Are you talking about setting up for the festival yesterday?
 How was it, Keiichi-kun?
 Did you do your job properly?"
The slight muscle pain throughout my body and my sluggish movements were already obvious...

<Mion>
"I did great.
 I'm pretty worn out now, though~!"
I grin dryly and the three of us break out into laughter.

<Keiichi>
"Where are Satoko and Rika-chan?
 Are we meeting up with them at the festival?"

<Rena>
"Yep.
 Rika-chan's actually been there since yesterday because she has such an important job.
 I think Satoko-chan stayed with her, so they're already at the shrine."
Right, I just remembered!
Today was Rika-chan's big performance.
 She'd been practicing especially hard for this day.
 ...As her friend, I needed to make sure I went and cheered her on!!

<Keiichi>
"All right! Let's go right away!!"

<Mion>
""Yeeeaaahh~~~!!""
As we got closer to the shrine, we started passing by more people and seeing a lot of parked cars.
 It began to get noisier, too... I thought I could hear something like a bon dance song.
Without being able to restrain my impatience, I dashed up the entire flight of stone stairs!

<Rena>
"K-Keiichi-kun, you're going too fast...
 ...Wait for meee~~...!!"

<Mion>
"Man, Kei-chan, you're such a little kid."
Whooaaa!! The shrine grounds... they were packed with people! It was a festival if I ever saw one!!

<Rena>
"Wow! They went all-out this year too!! Amazing, amazing!!"

<Mion>
"They're coming from Hinamizawa.

<Mion>
Huh? The old man from the Kimiyoshi branch family is here too!
 He'd been struggling with health issues since Watanagashi last year, but it looks like he got better!"
Yeah, there were a lot of villagers here that I didn't really know.
They must have all been pouring in just for today.

<Rena>
"Oh!
 It's Satoko-chan!
 Heeey!"

<Satoko>
"Oh, if it isn't everyone!
 Yes, hello to you all!!"

<Keiichi>
"Yo, Satoko.
 There's a lot of people today!! Don't get lost in the crowd, okay?"

<Satoko>
"W-Who do you even think you're talking to!!?"
Satoko, too, seems somehow energetic. Of course, I'm the same way.

<Rena>
"Huh? Where's Rika-chan? She still has free time, doesn't she?"

<Satoko>
"Rika was giving her respects to the mayor and other important people.
 She shall come before long."
I see. Rika-chan is the shrine maiden for today's festival, after all.
 ...It's probably a pain for her to say hello to all the elders.

<Rika>
"......It really is a pain.
 Hello, everyone."

<Rena>
"Ha... hau~~~~!!!!
 Rika-chaaaaan!!
 I-I-I want t-to t-take you hooomee!!!"
Rika-chan wore an immaculate shrine maiden outfit that looked fresh off the shelves.
...It was a perfect fit for her somehow mystical appearance!

<Mion>
"How does it fit?
 It's not too long, is it?
 My grandma gave me some safety pins just in case the sleeves are too long."

<Rika>
"......It's all right.
 It really is comfortable."
As she spoke, she began to do some twists and stretches.

<Rena>
"...It's great, it's great! It's so kyuute~~ Hau~~~!!"
There was approximately one person here getting a nosebleed from watching Rika-chan move.

<Rena>
"K-K-Keiichi-kun, don't you think she's kyuute? Don't you?
 If you don't, then she'll be all mine, and I'll take her home with me~~!!"

<Keiichi>
"I think she's really kyuute.
 Totally cool.
 Enough that I want to pretend to be her big brother or dad and take pictures with her. 

<Keiichi>
If we take a picture from two different places and make it stereoscopic... we can eat—or, rather, stare at—a real-life Rika-chan at our houses whenever we want~~!!"

<Rena>
"Hau~~~!!!! That sounds great, that sounds fantastic~~~!!!!"
Rena's eyes and mine glittered with stars as our noses bled and we drooled.

<Satoko>
"...Rika, you'd best stay away from them..."

<Rika>
"......Yes, or I might get locked away in a basement somewhere."

<Mion>
"A-ha-ha-ha!
 You look like you're enjoying it, though, Rika-chan!"

<Rika>
"......Mii, you're being harsh."
We all laughed together again.

<Mion>
"Okay, let's not hang around here! Let's get to the festival!!
 There's not much time left until Rika-chan's big debut."

<Keiichi>
"You're right. Great!! Let's go, everyone!!"

<Club Members>
"""Yeeaaahh!!!"""

<Festival Stall>
"Yo!
 If it isn't the daughter of Sonozaki!
 Eat up!!
 The yakisoba is packed full of pork~!
 This year we filled it up as much as we could! We even put in fried calamari!!"

<Mion>
"Gotcha, old timer!
 The yakisoba this year looks like quite an achievement.
 You have squid, too... You put a ton of time into this, didn't you!?"

<Rena>
"Wow! It's tasty! It's tasty!!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah. The squid is delicious, but the aroma is just fantastic.
 It wonderfully compensates for how soft it tends to be.
 There's a delightful amount of squid and pork in it, too.
 ......Yep! Not bad at all, I say!"

<Mion>
"Haha.
 Kei-chan, you sound like you could walk into a cooking program and become the host!"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 When I see Keiichi-kun acting like it's so good, it somehow tastes even better."

<Keiichi>
"I don't discriminate among delicious food!
 So anything that I say is tasty has got to be worth trying out, right?"

<Rika>
"......Then, Keiichi.
 Please, give us your opinion of this yakisoba again!"

<Keiichi>
"I'll do it in two words.
 ...Absolutely Scrumptious!!
 If I had a second stomach, I'd buy another one right now!"
Having heard my three-star rating, a whole line of people suddenly formed in front of the yakisoba stand.

<Mion>
"Wow, that's amazing.
 Kei-chan said it was so good that a little crowd started to form... not bad!!"
It was nothing to brag about, but I still decide to stick out my chest and put on airs.
 Mm-hmm.

<Satoko>
"Oh, is that so?
 Then perhaps I shall try it out.
 Mister, mister, could I perchance bother you for one takoyaki?"
Satoko bought a stick of takoyaki—balls of fried octopus—from the adjacent stand, and after blowing on it, put one of them into her mouth.

<Rena>
"How is it, Satoko-chan?
 If you give it a good rating, then Rena will buy it too~!"
Chomp, chomp,
 chew, chew.
 Gulp.

<Mion>
"Now, it's time for Hinamizawa's very own food critic, Judge Satoko Houjou, to give her impressions!"

<Satoko>
"......Ummmm......
 ............Mgh......"
Though she was all for it a moment ago, Satoko hesitated to give her thoughts.
 ...Hey, now, what's the matter?
Everyone else takes one of their own and puts it into their mouths.

<Rena>
"...Huhhh?
 Rena got gipped."

<Rika>
"......Mine's bad, too.
 ...There's no octopus in it."
...This takoyaki vendor...
Could this be some sort of summer festival only 'octopus-free takoyaki' stand!?!?
An evil takoyaki stand that skimped on the octopus because they figured it would make them good money today...!!

<Mion>
"Ah, mine has some.
 ...Yeah.
 It's pretty good, considering there's octopus in it."

<Satoko>
"...How am I supposed to... explain that this octopus-free takoyaki is any good...?"
Everyone wondered about that.
......Our quizzical looks seem to be drawing equally dubious stares from the people in line...

<Rena>
"Umm, err... How about this?
 Takoyaki without any octopus is really healthy~☆.
 And even people who don't like octopus can eat this delicious takoyaki~...☆"
After hearing that, several surprised guests left the line.
It had the exact opposite effect...

<Mion>
"Alright, then I'll give it a try next.
 A self-inspired take on takoyaki, in which you can clearly taste the simple flavors of the flour, green onions, and pickled ginger! 

<Mion>
The unaffected taste is bolstered by the absence of octopus..."

...It wasn't half bad, but after hearing the "there's no octopus in it" clause, even more people left the line.

<Keiichi>
"...R-Rika-chan, any good comments?
 ...You can be honest."

<Rika>
"......400 yen is too much for this."

Gehah!
 That was too honest!!
...Even more customers leave the line, dealing a lethal blow.
There were other takoyaki stands around, after all.

<Mion>
"Well
~~...
 I mean, umm...
 We might not want to be doing this~...
 Hey, Satoko!
 You started all this, so give us a great big turnaround!"

<Satoko>
"Mgh... I cannot do it!!
 How do you expect me to lavish praise upon takoyaki without any octopus in it!?"
Gah, you idiot!!!
Satoko's angry outburst was the finishing blow.

<Rena>
"Ah, ack!
 The customers are all gone...!
 Huh?
 The guy is staring at us.
 ...Why is that? Why is that? Hau~~!!!"
Sigh.
 ...There's no saving this crowd.
Perhaps I, Keiichi Maebara-sama, will lend a generous hand...

<Rika>
"......Keiichi-kun, you could do it.
 We want you to save the takoyaki vendor who didn't put any octopus in."

<Keiichi>
"...Don't smile as you say something so bitter.
 ...All right, fine.
 This may be the only chance you'll get to see a pro at work, so watch carefully."
I shoved the stick into an octopus-less takoyaki and crammed it into my mouth.
As before, there wasn't any octopus in it.
...But Mion's had some in it.
 ...That was the important point.

<Keiichi>
"The man who runs this takoyaki stand... He truly loves takoyaki, in every meaning of the word.
 No, it could even be said that he adores it."

<Club Members and Old Man>
"""Ehhh...?!?!"""
Everyone gasped in surprise.
 ...Including the takoyaki vendor glaring at us.

<Keiichi>
"This man truly does love takoyaki.
 And because he loves it, he doesn't want to create halfhearted, random ones.
 ......Isn't that right?"
The takoyaki vendor looked down, unsure.
Those watching were listening intently, wanting to know why octopus-less takoyaki deserved such a high rating.

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san, if he really and truly loved takoyaki that much, why did he make takoyaki without octopus at all?!
 Is he not betraying that very takoyaki!?"

<Keiichi>
"You may be right.
 In one sense, it is a betrayal.
 However...... It's the best possible compromise this man could find.
 This man is making real takoyaki today, as he always does! 

<Keiichi>
However, only one or two of them on each stick are the real ones."

<Mion>
"Well, you're right.
 The one I ate had octopus in it...
 ...and considering it did actually have it, it didn't taste bad at all, you know?"

<Keiichi>
"Right.
 That was a bona fide takoyaki... 

<Keiichi>
...And as for the other ones...
 It was the biggest compromise he could make against the biases of the general populace, who all think that there need to be eight pieces on the stick, or else it's not real takoyaki."

<Rena>
"Huh? Keiichi-kun, I don't understand what you mean.
 Why is one of them the real thing, and all the other ones are fakes? Why?"

<Keiichi>
"The secret... lies in the octopus.
 Mister, this octopus...
 It's true Akashi octopus, isn't it?

<Keiichi>
In recent years, the number of octopuses caught in Akashi has decreased, and their prices have risen drastically.
 The prices are now so high... that you wouldn't think of using them in takoyaki."
Then the man, who had been looking down this whole time, mumbled...

<Festival Stall>
"...Yeah, that's right.
 Akashi octopus... It's very expensive..."

<Keiichi>
"But this man absolutely had to have the Akashi octopus!

<Keiichi>
He could have bought much worse-quality octopus for cheaper, as much as he wanted, and he would have still been able to fool everyone!

<Keiichi>
There are plenty of other scamming takoyaki vendors who claim theirs are from Akashi, even though they're not!!

<Keiichi>
But this man wouldn't accept it! He wouldn't tell lies!
 Akashi octopus are supreme!!!
 He would never relinquish this one stubborn conviction!!!
 This man loved takoyaki!
 That's why he never lied!! 

<Keiichi>
Yet... There was one point that he absolutely had to compromise on."

<Satoko>
"W-What might that be...?"

<Keiichi>
"The number.
 The popular opinion is that a stick of takoyaki should have 8 pieces on it.
 Even if it's real Akashi octopus, he couldn't charge 400 yen for just one piece, could he?! 

<Keiichi>
If he didn't have eight pieces, nobody would buy them...
 ...This man wept over it!!

<Keiichi>
In order to make just one true piece of takoyaki...
he wouldn't ever let himself lie through the other seven!!!!"
Oh, whoooahhhh!!! The octopus-free takoyaki vendor burst into tears.
I gently clap one of his shoulders.

<Keiichi>
"No matter what anyone else says, I will never forget how genuine you are.
 You, sir, are a true vendor of takoyaki!!!
 You are the only one in the world with the right to call himself that!!!!"
Clap clap... clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap...!!!!
As I embraced the shoulders of this man, shedding his manly tears, those watching delivered a round of applause, moved by my speech!

<Keiichi>
"Everyone!!
 I beg of you, please, eat some of this true takoyaki vendor's takoyaki!!
 If we don't treasure genuine men like this, then how can we protect the true path of the takoyaki!? 

<Keiichi>
If nobody else will eat them, then I will eat them aaaalllll!!!"

<Rena>
"Wah, wah, everyone watching is lining up!
 Keiichi-kun, you did it! You did it!!"

<Mion>
"I think it's more they thought Kei-chan's propaganda speech was interesting rather than that the takoyaki actually looked good.
 ...Kei-chan, you could probably sell plain old rocks if you tried!"

<Rika>
"......You would do well at product demonstrations in a supermarket."

<Satoko>
"...I suspect he would be good at selling off suspicious wonder-knives."
Absolutely stunned at my successful pitch, the guy manning the stall next to this one called out to me.

<Festival Stall>
"Hey, hey, you guys, do that for my sweets, too!!"

<Keiichi>
"Great! You all get the gist of it, right?
 It's your turn this time, Rena!"

<Rena>
"Okay! I'll do my best~!!
 ......Hau~~!!!
 When apricot sweets are cold, they're very, very good~!!
 The apricot is sitting so quietly an' nicely on top of the syrup.
 Hau, it's sho kyute!! 

<Rena>
I wanna take it home~~! Hau~~~~!!!!!"
...It looks like she lost herself in this midway through...
...but a girl giving it such natural praise was itself bringing in some customers!!
A line was quickly forming behind Rena!

<Keiichi>
"Next up is the okonomiyaki stand!!
 Satoko, you're up!"

<Satoko>
"Umm, rather, well...
 The crunch of the fried tempura batter mixed with yakisoba is simply to die for!! 

<Satoko>
With a huge piece of bacon laid on top, when you bite into it, it all comes flooding out... chomp chomp chomp!!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeaahh!!
 That's freakin' great!!
 N-Now I want to try some, too!!"
Then, a huge line formed at my words!!
What on earth is this?
...So basically, all these onlookers are just following us around to all the stands.

<Rika>
"......When people hear about food from others and then try it for themselves, it tastes a lot better than it normally would!"
So that's it.
Even Rika-chan was gorging herself on the food, getting sauce on the bib she'd put on to prevent her shrine maiden outfit from getting dirty.

<Mion>
"Nice! The older guys are getting into it, too!
 Okay, Kei-chan, which one should I do!?"

<Keiichi>
"Right! Mion, you go to the stand next to that!! Show them the depths of your power!!"

<Rena>
"Huh? B-But Kei-chan, the stall next to that is..."
Whoops!
A goldfish-scooping stand!
 A bit out of our element.

<Mion>
"No, as club president, I won't flee no matter who or what my opponent is.
 Let's get started!"

<Satoko>
"...I look forward to a splendid performance, Mion-san!!!"
The onlookers were also watching Mion with hopeful eyes.

<Festival Stall>
"Welcome, welcome!
 Here's your net and bowl."

<Mion>
"Okay, here we go."
"......Hmm! The goldfish are energetic today!!
 They really look delicious!
 Small things like these—you could crunch 'em down whole~!!!"
Mutter mutter...!?

<Satoko>
"...Mi... Mion-san... wh-what in the world are you saying...?"

<Rena>
"......Mii-chan... You eat them?
 Did you... did you eat the one Rena caught last year too?"

<Mion>
"N-No... I-I didn't say anything like that...!!"
Mion's face went red and she shook it vehemently in denial.

<Keiichi>
"Well, I mean... You just said so yourself that they really look delicious."

<Shion>
"Yes, you did indeed say so.
 My sister is omnivorous. She eats anything that can go in her mouth."

<Rika>
"......If they taste good, then maybe I'll try one next time."

<Rena>
"N-N-N-N-N-N-No, Rika-chan, don't! You'll get sick...!!!"
...Wait a second.
 Hey, what the hell?
 Shion... How long have you been here!?!?

<Shion>
"Heya, Kei-chan, Mion, everyone! Good evening."

<Mion>
"Ah... aaahhhhaaaaaaaahhh!!!
 Where did you come from, Shioonnnn!?!?"

<Shion>
"I've been here since the bit with the yakisoba.
 You were all so loud that I found you right away."

<Mion>
"Geez!!
 You've got nothing to do with this, do you!?!?
 Go somewhere else already!!"

<Shion>
"Geez, Mion, don't treat me so cruelly.
 ...Right, Kei-chan?
 You're okay with me being here, right?"
she asked, grabbing my arm and pushing her chest into it.
 Bounce.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun... Your nose is bleeding..."

<Keiichi>
"When you squish a jelly donut, the jelly comes out, right?
 It's the same.
 This isn't something I have any control over..."

<Shion>
"Heh, is that right?
 Then will more come out if I squeeze harder?

<Shion>
Eei! ☆
 Squeeze."
S-Shion's... her cleavage, it's... it's right up against my chest......
 Driiiiiiip.

<Mion>
"Gyaahhhh!!!!
 Shion, what the heck are you trying to dooooo!!?"

<Satoko>
"...How vulgar!!
 I seem to have misjudged you!!"

<Rika>
"That looks fun. I'll try it too."
Rika-chan clasps onto my other arm, too.
 Rub.
A plentiful, plump feeling on my left shoulder, and the sour sensation of a young, unripe fruit on my right......
 Ha... Hau~~~~!!!!!
Boom boom baaaang!!!!!
Shion, Rika-chan, and I, our faces now bruised, fell to the ground, limbs sprawled.

<Mion>
"Nice job, Rena..."

<Rena>
"E-E-E-E-Everyone's so dirty...! Hau..."

<Rika>
"......Rena punched me.
 It really hurts..."

<Satoko>
"R-Rika, you get what you deserve..."
Sh-Sheesh...
Now that Shion was here, the energy around us had increased by 120%...

<Shion>
"Fufu, ah-hahahaha...!
 Your friends are so much fun, Mion.
 I never get bored of them."

<Mion>
"Agh, right.
 If you weren't here, it would be way more fun, you know!!!"

<Shion>
"Ahahahahaha!
 I want to stay with you all, but if I continue seducing Kei-chan, my sister looks like she's literally going to bite my head off.
 So I'll retreat for now.
 I'll be back.
 See you, Mion!"

<Mion>
"Don't be back!!!
 Get the salt! Someone get the saaaaalt!!!"
After teasing her older sister so much, Shion ran away into the crowd of people and disappeared.

<Satoko>
"......I feel that I have borne witness to a rare side of Mion-san."

<Rena>
"When Mii-chan is with Shii-chan, she looks kinda kyuute!!"
Rena smiled happily, earning her a whack on the head from Mion.

<Mion>
"Don't say dumb stuff! Let's get to the next stand already!!"
We went about just like that, really noisy and lively, to the other stands.
We were paying money towards the beginning, but midway through, the guys running the shops thought we were just too funny, and we ended up being able to fool around without paying much more.
Thuuump!
The vigorous sound of a big taiko drum echoed through the air.

<Satoko>
"Rika, it looks like it's time."

<Rena>
"Ah... Yep, looks like it."
Right, it's just about time for Rika-chan to appear in the offertory dance...

<Rika>
"......I'm a little nervous."

<Mion>
"Believe in yourself!
 All of your sweat will definitely amount to something, Rika-chan."
Mion slapped hard on Rika-chan's back!

<Satoko>
"That's right. You'll do fantastic, Rika!!"

<Rika>
"......I'll do my best."

<Rena>
"Yeah! That's the spirit~!"
I ball my hand into a fist and raise it into the air.

<Keiichi>
"We're rooting for you, Rika-chan!! Go for it, yay! Remember?!"

<Club Members>
"""Go for it, yay!!!"""
Rika-chan gave the best smile I'd ever seen, then pivoted on her heel and ran off.

<Rena>
"Okay... we should get going too!"

<Keiichi>
"Right. Let's go cheer her on!!"

<Satoko>
"You mustn't!
 You must keep silent during the performance!"
I got it, geez! I rubbed a hand through her hair. She was worried about her good friend up to the end.

<Mion>
"Then we'd better hurry!
 All the good spots will be taken!!
 Come on!!"
Mion ran off, and everyone else followed a moment later.
A large amount of people had already clustered into the tight space to watch the edifying dance.

<Keiichi>
"Wow, this is... this is a lot of people!!"
I turned around to look at everyone else, but nobody was there.
Wh-Where did everyone go?!
...They probably got lost among all these people.
Finally, I spotted the back of Mion's head on the other side of the crowd.
 It definitely doesn't look like I can get over there.
...Well, we got separated. No big deal.
 We can just meet back up when Rika-chan's dance is over.
I gave up on finding the others and wandered around, trying to look for a place where I'd be able to see better.
...It didn't take long for me to realize I'd have to settle for watching between the heads of the people in front of me, though.
Thuuump!
Once again, an even louder taiko drum resounded.
This one was to announce the beginning of the dance.
I couldn't see very well, but it seemed like Rika-chan had come on stage with the elders, who were in priestly garb.
I heard low exhalations of admiration and the seniors rubbing their prayer beads in gratitude.
Everyone's heads were in the way, and I couldn't see. It was really frustrating.
We should have cut playtime short and come here to get good spots earlier...
After Rika-chan intoned the prayer, she took the festival hoe and walked to the pile of quilts stacked on the altar.
That's right.
 The point of the ceremony was to purify bedding and to hold a memorial service, wasn't it...
Then, the solemn offertory dance began.
She had practice using a mochi-pounding mallet... The awkwardly-shaped festival hoe Rika-chan held seemed really heavy.
Back and forth, up and down. It was doubtlessly difficult to even lift in the air, but she sweated and waved, raised, and dropped it, again and again.
She couldn't just deal with it and do it grudgingly. As the shrine maiden, she needed to retain the dignity and solemnity present at this festival.
......There must be a ton of pressure on Rika-chan's shoulders right now...
......Damn!! Why am I cheering her on from a place I can barely see her?!
I'm her friend, so I should be right up in the best spot rooting for her!

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, over here!"
Someone tugged lightly on the back of my shirt collar.
 ...It was Shion.
 She beckoned me outside the crowded ring of people.
She had a mischievous grin on her face, and I took it as her saying she knew a good place nobody else knew of.

<Keiichi>
"Shion? ...What's up?"

<Shion>
"Shh!
 Just be quiet and come with me."
After she told me so, she ran in a big detour around the throng.
Man, it's great to have someone who knows the lay of the land here at times like this!
 Impressed though I was, I nearly lost sight of her right away.
No more getting separated for me.
I ran after her so that I wouldn't be left behind.
As I wondered in anticipation what kind of secret spot Shion had in mind, we left the crowd of people and went around to the back of the shrine grounds.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, wait... Where are we going...?!
 We're getting further and further away!"

<Shion>
"Shhhh!
 Just stay quiet and follow me. You'll understand soon."
Shion gave me a wink that reminded me of Mion as she said that.
No sign of people, and not much moonlight—it was dark.
 We had gotten pretty far away from the crowd of people on the shrine grounds.
...How are we supposed to see Rika-chan's dance from here?

<Keiichi>
"I see. ...There's some high spot around here, isn't there?
 Like a rooftop, or somewhere we can look down at it, right?"

<Shion>
"What? Why do we have to climb onto the roof?"

<Keiichi>
"Well, how else are we supposed to see Rika-chan's dance?"

<Shion>
"Did you really want to see Rika-chama's dance?
 Kei-chan, could it be that your strike zone is really low?"

<Keiichi>
"...I don't think we're understanding each other here.
 Weren't you going to show me somewhere I could see Rika-chan's dance from easily?"

<Shion>
"What?
 ...Who made that promise?"
Ngahhh!!
 What's going oonnnnn??!
Why me?!
 Why do I always misunderstand Shion?!
Is it my fault?!
 Am I just reading the wrong things into it?!?!

<Keiichi>
"T-Then why did you call me all the way out here?!"
With an expression that indicated she wasn't fooling around, Shion pressed her index finger to my lips and said slowly and quietly,
(...This place is a dark, dead, empty spot. You can't see it from the festival grounds, and now a male and female of the same age are all alone together.)
......Eehhhhh?!?!
 C-C-C-Could this be?!?!
 Shion... She's not planning something crazy again, is she?!?!

<Shion>
(Shhhhh!
 Look over there...!
 See?)
Shion whispered, pointing into the dark underbrush...
And there we saw... two figures, one male, and one female.

<Keiichi>
(Wha... What's that?
 ...............I-Is that...)

<Shion>
(We're right at the scene of a rendezvous, of course~.
 See, look closely.
 Can you tell who they are?)
I peered intently into the dark at Shion's suggestion.
...Oh, it's Tomitake-san and Takano-san...!
The two of them were clearly breathing quietly and glancing around to make sure nobody knew they were there, as they crouched before the entrance to a wooden, storehouse-like building.

<Keiichi>
(...Wait, Shion.
 ......Could this be what you wanted to show me?)

<Shion>
(Kei-chan.
 You can see Rika-chama's dance any year, but you won't ever get another chance like this, okay?)
......I had thought the Sonozaki sisters each had their own personalities, but at times like this they seemed all too similar...

<Keiichi>
(I'm going back!
 Don't call me for something like this again!!)

<Shion>
(Ah, if you move now, they'll see us...!!)
At our noisy argument, Takano-san suddenly turned around!

<Takano>
"......Oh, my. Who might that be?"
We held our breaths and tried to wait it out, but it seemed like Takano-san was now acutely aware of our presence.
Shion and I exchanged glances, then gave up and climbed out from behind the bush.

<Shion>
"Well, hello there.
 The moon sure is beautiful tonight, isn't it?"

<Takano>
"My, my.
 If it isn't Shion-chan and Maebara-kun.
 Good evening. Yes, the moon certainly is pretty."

<Tomitake>
"What's this...? Keiichi-kun, you sure are smart, you know that?
 Having a secret date in a place like this?
 Then I guess we accidentally interrupted something important. A-ha-ha-ha!!"
You're the ones who were meeting up secretly!!
Tomitake-san and Takano-san laughed to themselves, and it got on my nerves for some reason.

<Shion>
"Wait, so you two weren't having a little rendezvous, then?"

<Tomitake>
"O-Of course we weren't.
 Though I don't dislike that kind of romance."

<Takano>
"Heehee...
 Unfortunately, this wasn't the location of a rendezvous either of you would want to see.
 Sorry for not living up to your expectations."

<Shion>
"Hmm.
 If this wasn't a rendezvous, then what were you doing?
 Tomitake-san, were you messing around with the padlock on the door just now?"
Huh? After she said that, I looked at the two of them again...
 And I definitely saw it.
They were hunched in front of a warehouse door, fiddling with a pretty heavy-looking padlock.

<Tomitake>
"......Guess we've been found out, huh?
 We were trying to break into the warehouse... 
but don't tell anyone, all right?"

<Keiichi>
"D-Don't tell anyone...?
 Are you thieves or something?!"
I demanded unthinkingly, just because of how absently Tomitake-san was grinning.

<Takano>
"Nah, never.
 Thieves are people who steal things, right?
 It's not like we were trying to take anything out of here."

<Shion>
"I see...
 Then why are you trying to unlock the door?
 This is the forbidden storehouse for ritual tools.
 They say only the Furude family and a mere handful of others are allowed in."
Forbidden storehouse...?
 I took a few steps back at that and looked on the entire warehouse.
It certainly looked like one, built removed from any signs of people, almost as if in secret.
...It was filthy, revealing how little it was ever opened.
And...it was built to be durable, giving it a strange, overpowering impression...
Now that I looked at it more closely, it was certainly different than normal warehouses.

<Takano>
"This place...
 They're called ritual implements.
 Basically, this is a warehouse where they store such tools used in rituals.
 ...Well, more accurately, maybe it's a temple where the implements are enshrined.

<Takano>
The ritual hoe Rika-chan is using for the offertory dance was inside here until today.

<Takano>
Of course, if anyone but the Furude family enters...
 ...they bring 'impurity' into it, so absolutely no one is allowed a single step inside it.
 ......It's a sanctuary."
Shouldn't we absolutely NOT be coming to a place like this, then?!
However, Takano was wearing a childlike expression—an innocent smile at best, and terribly cruel grin at worst.

<Takano>
"I told you I was researching Hinamizawa's folk tales and legends out of an interest in them, didn't I?
 A lot of the answers to questions I'm curious about are hidden away inside here.

<Takano>
I've waited all this time until today for this chance."
A chance.
 ...Everybody's eyes were fixed on the dance at the shrine grounds today.
 This was the ultimate blind spot.

<Shion>
"Heh, I see.
 I didn't know you had lockpicking skills, Tomitake-san."

<Tomitake>
"...Stop it.
 I don't want to be doing this, okay?"

<Takano>
"Sorry for taking you along with me, but
 this was all thanks to you, Jirou-san.
 I really am grateful."

<Tomitake>
"Sheesh...
 This is the only time, understand, Takano-san?
 I don't want to be sneaking into places like this."

<Takano>
"Heehee... You really are a good person, Jirou-san."
Ker-clink.
...Tomitake-san undid the padlock and placed it to the side.

<Tomitake>
"It's open."

<Takano>
"Thank you.
 ...At long last."
Takano-san gulped. With an unusually excited air about her, she gave the heavy door a shove...
The sharp smell of mold and dust flowed out from the gap in the doors...
I had claimed curses didn't exist, but... in this situation, I could believe in them.
...If we went into such a holy place with our shoes on... it feels like we could be punished somehow.

<Takano>
"How about it?
 You're accomplices, too.
 You came all the way here, so why not come in and take the tour? 

<Takano>
It'll be a little field trip to a museum of precious cultural artifacts that conceal the secret history of Hinamizawa.
 ...And it's only open today. Heehee..."

<Keiichi>
"W-We're not... accomplices, or anything..."

<Shion>
"...Aren't you interested, though?
 Come on, let's take a peek,"
Shion said, predictably, linking her arm with mine.

<Keiichi>
"B-But... We definitely shouldn't be doing this...!
 This is a holy warehouse, isn't it?
 You said ritual implements, right?!
 I really feel like we shouldn't go in...!"

<Shion>
"I'm a part of the Sonozaki family, so I have a good guess as to what we'll find in there,
 but I want you to see it too, Kei-chan."

<Keiichi>
"You want to show something to me...?"
I thought it was just a ploy, but Shion's eyes looked entirely serious.
...Of course, she was the sort who could lie with a straight face.
Of course... I was an average boy, too.
My curiosity was at least twice that of a normal person.
Sleeping, forbidden treasures, never to leave this warehouse. Chances like this don't come around too often.
If I had to choose, then... I want to see!
Until the locked door is open, though...
 I dunno about this...!

<Shion>
"If you're not interested, Kei-chan, then you can leave now.
 I think you'll wonder about it later, though,"
Tomitake-san spoke after listening to our discussion, himself having sat down on the stairs to take a short rest.

<Tomitake>
"I'll keep watch here.
 Go in and check it out with them.
 I'm not too interested...
 but it might be pretty interesting for a young guy like you, Keiichi-kun. ......Fu-fu-fu!"
he said, laughing mischievously.
 There was no ill will in his laughter.

<Keiichi>
"Tomitake-san, do you know what's in here?"

<Tomitake>
"Kind of.
 Takano-san told me all about it."

<Shion>
"Must be a pain to have to go along with your companion's unique hobbies, huh~?"
Tomitake-san didn't answer that, only responding with a pained smile.
Takano-san had this kind of scary air about her, like she'd drop absolutely everything else for something she had an interest in and go straight for it, but...
Tomitake-san, on the other hand, seemed like the gold standard of what a normal person should be.
...Having him tell me so frankly to go check it out suddenly made the guilt feel lighter.

<Keiichi>
"Okay......... but just a little.
 ...If it's not interesting, I'm leaving."
"You got it!" Shion gave me another Mion-like wink.

<Takano>
"Looks like we're decided.
 Shall we go inside?
 ...Jirou-san, we'll leave this to you."
Tomitake-san waved his hand to see us off.
The inside was pitch black, but Takano-san turned on the battery-powered lantern she'd brought, revealing a pretty cramped front room.

<Tomitake>
"It's so dark in here.
 Everyone, take care not to trip over anything."

<Takano>
"I appreciate the concern.
 ...Okay, doorman, keep a good watch.
 We're shutting the door now."
Takano-san smiled spitefully, as if leaving Tomitake-san out of something fun, and began to close the door.

<Tomitake>
"Man...
 ...All right, everyone, have fun."
There was a low, heavy, and loud noise... and we were completely cut off from the outside world... and covered in silent darkness.
 ...Takano-san's lantern was the only light we had.

<Takano>
"It'll be fine.
 It's an outdoor lantern with backup batteries inside.
 It won't go out or anything."
Looks like Takano noticed my uneasy expression.
 ...I couldn't help but blush a little and avert my gaze.
Deeper inside, there was a heavy and old-but-sturdy door with solemn decorations on it.
...It was the last door sealing away what was within...

<Takano>
"Strange how it has an antechamber even though it's just a warehouse, isn't it? 

<Takano>
...I believe it's set up this way so that you open one door at a time, never letting the room with all the tools be seen from the outside."
Takano-san explained this, awfully impressed by the construction.
...But still... it's really dark in here.
 ......Huh?
 That, over there, it's...
I spotted a circuit breaker hanging from a clump of wiring, clumsily attached to the wall.

<Keiichi>
"Oh, here, isn't this the light switch or something?"
I flip the biggest switch I can find, and with a *click*, the pitch-black room was illuminated by an old, bare light bulb.
Everyone scrunched up their faces at the sudden strobe-like brightness.

<Shion>
"Don't!!"
Before she even finished, Shion slapped my hand and flipped the switch back.
There was another loud *click*, and the room returned to darkness, with only the lantern for illumination...

<Keiichi>
"Oww..."

<Shion>
"You can't, Kei-chan.
 We snuck in here, remember?
 If you turn on the light, it might give us away...!"
I'm scolded by Shion fairly harshly...
It looked like she was worried about whether someone had seen them from the momentary light.

<Takano>
"It's all right.
 It was only for a moment."
Takano-san remained a relaxed adult.
...It seemed like she was confident she could talk her way out of it if someone did see us...

<Takano>
"Let's go in.
 ...Here we go...
 There."
The even heavier door opened... and this time, it wasn't just the dust that came out with the air—there was also a nasty smell.
......One smell was like opening a dust-filled cupboard in the back of a kitchen that hadn't been opened in years... 
and the other smell, the nasty one, was hard to explain... but it was like the raw odor of a fish market.
From how the sound echoed, this room felt far larger than the first.
Takano-san held up her lantern and revealed the contents of the expansive room.

<Keiichi>
"...Whoa...!!"
At the back wall of the storehouse, right in front of us...was a Buddha-like holy object, standing there, looking down at us.
I was taken aback by its unseen force, lit up by the slender beam of the lantern.

<Takano>
"That's the guardian god of Hinamizawa...
 Oyashiro-sama."

<Shion>
"...It's far grander than the one at the shrine."
Oyashiro-sama.
...So this is the spirit protecting Hinamizawa.
The one guarding the holy land of Hinamizawa from the impurities of the outside world, and the one delivering punishment after punishment upon those who attempted to sully the land with the dam construction...

<Takano>
"...It looks like... there are far more tools stored here than I thought, but...
 This is so sad.
 None of them have been maintained.
 ...How unfortunate that they're in such a state..."
Even in the dim light, I could see a lot of strange objects lining the walls, ceiling, and shelves.
Takano-san, speaking as if in a trance, was infatuated by the various implements filling the dark room.
...They weren't very festival-like, or traditional, but instead... this was more like the workshop of a blacksmith or a carpenter...
 There were a lot of large wooden and metal tools packed in here.
Putting it bluntly, it was all pretty boring stuff.
I'd imagined there would be more artistic things in here from the Heian period, but...
 these are a far cry from being cultural artifacts.
My expression betrayed my dashed hopes, and they caught on right away.

<Takano>
"......Oh...
 ...Is this not interesting for you?"

<Keiichi>
"I'm not into literature or art, so...
 ...I can look at this stuff, but I don't really understand its value."

<Takano>
"Fufu.
 ...Keiichi-kun, you really do look like you don't get it.
 I guess that's only natural."
Takano-san reached into a paper bag that she'd been holding the whole time, took out a worn scrapbook, and began to flip through it.

<Takano>
"...Then just for you, Keiichi-kun, I'll tell you an old story.
 It's a common tale in this region.
 If you go to the library, it would even be on their recommended reading list."
Telling stories... in such a dark, creepy place?
......She must have a horror story in mind.
Shion's face belied nothing but calm.
If she had the same personality as Mion, she'd have found fault with me being scared.
...I'll endure it for now and pretend to be calm.

<Takano>
"Okay?
 All right... I'll read it."
After confirming that I was going to be quiet and listen, she began to speak softly, like a kindergarten teacher reading a picture book...

<Takano>
"Long, long ago, in a certain village in the mountains, there was a swamp.
 This swamp was very, very deep. Some even called it bottomless.
 People said it was connected to Hell, the land of demons."
The rumors said that it was deeper than the ocean, and that anyone it swallowed would sink into the underworld—a bottomless swamp.
Its name was Onigafuchi...
...Wait.
I thought back to the story I heard yesterday about the sacrifices sinking in the bottomless swamp.
 ...Could that be the swamp she's talking about?

<Keiichi>
"...So then the village... was Hinamizawa, right?"

<Takano>
"You catch on quickly.
 That's right.
 ...Though it was called Onigafuchi Village at the time."

<Keiichi>
"Onigafuchi Village...
 ...That's a pretty inauspicious name..."

<Shion>
"It evokes quite the image, doesn't it?
 I hear that the name was changed in the Meiji period."
...The name of the swamp connected to Hell was called Onigafuchi, which meant "The Demon's Abyss."
...And the true name of this village, Hinamizawa...
 ...was Onigafuchi Village.

<Takano>
"The villagers belonged to that abyss—or to hell, in other words.
 ...They lived their lives worshipping the swamp said to connect to it.
 But then, one day..."
Demons began to appear, one after the other, from deep in the swamp.
...The villagers feared...
that hell was overflowing.
The demons mercilessly attacked the villagers.
They could only watch in fear.
...They could do no more than hide themselves and tremble...

<Keiichi>
"...So did someone exterminate them?"

<Takano>
"Unfortunately, there is no Momotarou or Superman in this fairy tale."

<Keiichi>
"Then... did they get the whole village together to fight them?"

<Takano>
"Heavens, no.
 The villagers weren't nearly strong enough to fight on equal terms with the demons."

<Keiichi>
"...Then... the only recourse would be to flee the village..."

<Takano>
"They couldn't do that, either.
 ...To the villagers, it was their beloved homeland.
 It didn't matter how terrifying the demons, they wouldn't have run away so easily."

<Keiichi>
"...Then... what did they do?
 Wouldn't they just get wiped out?"
Unable to fight, and unable to run.
 ...All they could do was wait for the village to be destroyed...
Then, when everyone had lost hope...
...their god...
 'Oyashiro-sama' descended unto them.

<Keiichi>
"I see...
 So Oyashiro-sama came down from the sky and beat up all the demons, then."

<Shion>
"...You're such a boy, Kei-chan.
 You always jump straight to using force to resolve things,"
Shion sighed, a little annoyed. Embarrassed, I held my tongue.

<Takano>
"The thing about Oyashiro-sama...
 He wasn't a violent god who would beat them up, like you're saying.
 ......He was a kind god, filled with love and benevolence."
The strength of Oyashiro-sama descended from the heavens couldn't be compared to that of the demons.
 They didn't even fight—they simply prostrated themselves before his radiant authority...
Oyashiro-sama urged them to go back to Hell from whence they came, but the demons wept and challenged him, saying they could never return.

<Takano>
"The world of the demons, too, has harsh commandments.
 They claimed they had been banished from Hell."
Demons...
 who didn't have a place to go, neither in Hell nor in the human world...
Of course, they were at fault for attacking the village.
 They deeply reflected on it and were sorry.

<Takano>
"As the villagers conversed amongst themselves, little by little they came to pity the demons, and...
 ...after talking with everyone in the village, they decided to live alongside them."

<Keiichi>
"A lot of fairy tales have them being exterminated or driven away... but you don't often hear one where they live in peace."

<Shion>
"You're right.
 Demons are supposed to symbolize all evils.
 A story where they decide to live together with humans is certainly strange."
When the demons first heard the villagers' invitation, they doubted their ears, but soon burst into tears of joy.
The villagers had given them a place to live.
It was said that in payment for this good deed, the demons shared their many kinds of power and secrets with the villagers.

<Takano>
"Oyashiro-sama was very pleased with this happy exchange.
 He gave the demons the bodies of humans so that they would be indistinguishable from the villagers.

<Takano>
He himself decided to stay on the surface and watch over the everlasting peace between them."
A land in which man, demon, and god live together.
...I had thought the word "demon" was a noun meaning "evil that needs to be exterminated."
A god may have mediated for them, but you don't often hear happy endings like that where both sides live in harmony.
...I see. I guess it is kind of interesting.

<Takano>
"Although the normal fairy tale ends there,
 it was revised quite a bit during the Edo period into a much longer story."
After that, the humans and demons intermixed, and eventually there was no difference between them.

<Keiichi>
"So the demons ended up disappearing?"

<Shion>
"No.
 Not at all.
 Half of them stayed just as they were."
The knowledge the villagers had received from the demons basically made them into something inhuman—what people call 'transcendent.'
They were well aware the power they had was heresy, and as those below worshipped them, they lived out their lives in secrecy...

<Takano>
"This story is the root of many derivative tales and pieces of fiction.
 It's the foundation, I mean.
 The basis."

<Keiichi>
"What do you mean by 'root'?"

<Shion>
"She means the part about the villagers having demon blood.
 ...What I mean is, all of the legends from around here are based on the premise that the villagers are descended from demons."
There was a hint of amusement in Shion's face as she said that.
 ...It was like she wanted to say that she, too, had demon blood in her.
...Is there any proof, though?
Maybe it's somehow rooted in historical fact beyond just fairy tales.

<Takano>
"Oh.
 ...Maebara-kun, then do you believe that demons really did come out of the swamp and breed with humans?"

<Keiichi>
"......Hmm, well, it's not that I don't believe it, but..."
When she said "demon," she meant the ones from Hell, but...
 ...In ancient Japan, the word wasn't necessarily used to denote only that kind, right?
The more well-known use involves the "drifting foreigner theory."
As the story goes, Westerners who were shipwrecked in nearby seas had such markedly different customs that they were called 'demons.'
Japanese people were relatively similar in appearance to other Asians, but everything about those from the West was different—their physiques, their faces, and their skin color.
In Japan, terms like "red demon" and "blue demon" evoke images especially of Westerners.
Lacking in skin pigments, Westerners would sunburn easily and turn red.
Being fair-skinned, I think blood vessels appearing on their skin would look blue, too.
A handful of accidental aliens would drift into Japan and came under persecution, being called demons.
They would flee into the mountains to survive, turn into bandit groups, and attack villages for food and the like.

<Keiichi>
"How does that explanation sound?
 ...Maybe it's a bit childish..."
Takano gave me a weird smile when, having come up with such an impromptu hypothesis, I unconsciously followed it up with self-deprecation.
Still, she didn't smile as if to make fun of me.

<Takano>
"It's not ridiculous.
 There are a lot of people who subscribe to the drifting foreigner theory.
 Even so, nobody actually knows what happened. 

<Takano>
Were they groups of foreigners who had turned to banditry, or were they really demons who had come from the bottom of the world...?"

<Keiichi>
"Then, ...er... Takano-san, which one do you believe?"

<Takano>
"The truth of the matter aside, I'd rather believe the more fantastic explanation.
 It's more fun that way, isn't it?"
Her answer made her sound a wee bit like a romanticist.
Here I'd thought she'd reject unrealistic stories like that.

<Takano>
"Now then.
 ......This is where... 
the fun begins."
Takano-san brought an end to her storytelling and waits for a moment as if to tantalize us.

<Shion>
"...?"
Suddenly, Shion looked around, as if something had caught her eye.
...Her head bobbed to and fro, like she was making sure nothing had changed.

<Keiichi>
"...? What's wrong, Shion?"

<Shion>
"......I'm sorry.
 Please don't worry about it."
Shion pretended as though nothing had happened.
Takano-san also made sure nothing had happened, then cleared her throat and broached the next subject.

<Takano>
"...I explained that half of the villagers have demon blood.
 That blood—they actually say that it's the blood of the kind of demon that eats people."

<Keiichi>
"...Man-eating demons?
 ......That escalated quickly."

<Takano>
"That blood still runs through the villagers' veins.
 ......They say that sometimes, the blood awakens from its slumber."
I thought the fairy tale had a happy ending, with the humans and demons living in peace... but it began to suddenly change into a brutal, bloody story...
...As Takano-san explained it, those with demon blood in them periodically awaken to their instincts as 'hunters.' 
So when this happens, it's said that they descended on the human villages looking for prey and conducted Onikakushi.

<Keiichi>
"What's an... Onikakushi?"

<Takano>
"Broadly speaking, it's when a demon kidnaps someone; when a person is 'demoned away.'"
 Takano-san's explanation was plain and simple... but when I imagined what it must have been like... it was terrifying.
They lose their human reason...
The villagers turn into real demons en masse...
 They attack the villages they loathe, in the dirty world of the masses below...
 ...and then they kill and eat their sacrifices.

<Keiichi>
"S-So they're no different from demons after all!
 ...What did Oyashiro-sama do?!
 Wasn't he supposed to be staying in the village and watching over them?"

<Takano>
"Oyashiro-sama knew about it, of course.
 Onikakushi isn't indiscriminate. The villagers apparently never kidnapped anyone other than the sacrifices decided upon by their god.
......A village inhabited by those both human and inhuman.
...It was like the heart-warming episode's colors had inverted, like negative film...
 ...revealing the painful...
 ...and ugly truth...

<Takano>
"So on the nights when they stole away villagers...
 this ritual became known as the 'Watanagashi.'"
Watanagashi.
...Tonight's festival was Watanagashi.
...I just couldn't reconcile the fun festival with the horrible tale Takano-san was telling me.

<Keiichi>
"Watanagashi, well, wasn't it...
 wasn't it about giving thanks to the futons we use over the winter or something?!"

<Shion>
"Kei-chan.
 ...'Wata' has another meaning, you know.
 It means 'entrails.'"
Shion, who had been silent until now, spoke up.

<Keiichi>
"Entrails?
 ......Oh, yeah, I guess that's true.
 Like, fish guts.
 ......Wait, what?!"
Like a jigsaw puzzle, the fun times I had today and Takano-san's grotesque tale clicked together in my mind.

<Keiichi>
"Watanagashi, so... 'gut-spilling'..."
I didn't think saying that could ever feel so nauseating...

<Takano>
"Yes.
 It's as you imagine, Maebara-kun.

<Takano>
...Right now, the Watanagashi Festival might just be a somewhat early summer festival occurring every June, but it used to be different.
 It... certainly wasn't the sort of event lively with street stands and festive chanting.
...It was more of a ghastly feast... the sort which would send a shiver down your spine and chill you to the bones...!!

<Keiichi>
"Th-That can't be true!!!"
I had no real reason to say that,
 but I couldn't help it.
...My fun memories from just a short while earlier swirled and blurred into noise, ...as if vanishing into a sandstorm. 
It felt like the name of the 'Watanagashi' had taken on a sticky dark, shadowy aura and was pressing down on my whole being, numbing my senses.
 My vision had turned gray, sapped of color, and everything looked like it was spinning dizzily.

<Takano>
"Why don't you think back to the offertory dance Rika-chan performed?
 Do you know...
 what she was doing up there?"

<Keiichi>
"No, I don't!
 I didn't even watch the whole thing, anyway...!!"

<Shion>
"Shhh!
 Kei-chan, you're getting too worked up."
Shion grabbed one of my ears, reminding me that this wasn't somewhere I should raise my voice.
 Even so, I still can't suppress this agitation I feel.

<Takano>
"Rika-chan was carrying a festival hoe.
 ...You've probably realized it already, but that's not a hoe for plowing fields."
 Takano-san cut off with a smirk... Did she mean to say that despite being a hoe, it actually serves as a sharp bladed tool...?
I didn't see the dance all the way through, so I don't know what kind of performance Rika-chan was putting on after I'd left.
When I told this to Takano-san, she kindly explained Rika-chan's dance to me.
To summarize what she said... After what I'd seen,
 Rika-chan would pierce the futons with that hoe,
 cut them open,
 and pull out the cotton inside...
She'd cut the cotton out, one bit at a time, and set it afloat.
 ......That's the kind of ritual it was.
...At Takano-san's strangely happy giggle, I felt, for some reason, violent displeasure.
Rika-chan... Every day during our lunch break, she'd take a rice-pounding mallet into the schoolyard... and she'd work so hard, sweating bullets, to practice for the offertory dance she had done today...
......All that effort...
 All that work...
 ...Takano-san disgraced it.
...Even though she worked so hard to practice for today......

<Shion>
"...Takano-san, I think you should choose your words more carefully.
 Kei-chan's pretty naive, so please don't tease him so much."
A moment before I opened my mouth to express how angry I was, Shion stopped me.
...Shion must have been fully aware of how that story made me feel.

<Takano>
"I'm sorry.
 ...I thought you'd like a story with that sort of shock value, since you're a boy."
Takano-san spoke without a hint of malice as she smiled gracefully.

<Shion>
"After hearing all that,
 ...Did you figure out what kind of stuff is in this storehouse, Kei-chan?
 See, look."
Shion pointed out one of the walls vaguely illuminated by the lantern's light.
......There was...
 ...Mere moments ago, they hadn't held my interest...
 They were just boring-looking tools lined up on the shelves.

<Keiichi>
"..................Ugh..."
All those uninteresting tools that I didn't understand how to use...
 They all suddenly took on a new meaning...... and I couldn't help but let out a groan...
At first they had looked like carpentry tools, like chisels or planes.
 ...However...
 when I thought back...
 I'd seen pictures of these sorts of tools before.
...Yeah, they... They came up in a Japanese history textbook.
Yes...... on the page introducing the <i>Kaitai Shinsho</i>, or the <i>New Text on Anatomy.</i>
These... aren't carpentry tools.
 ...These strangely-shaped tools... They're for dissection.
Everyone knows that in the Edo period, they would dissect the corpses of those who had been put to death in order to gain knowledge about Western medical techniques.
Illustrations of the dissection tools they used at the time came up in textbook supplements.
 ......The things hung up on this wall... all looked exactly the same as those.
Takano-san, holding the lantern, the only light source in the room, led us along the wall.
...She had the only light, so I had to walk after her whether I liked it or not.
Takano-san illuminated a coiled chain which left a bigger impression than the other things we saw.
The chain in itself was nothing unusual...... but further along it were metal fetters that were like hinges, clearly meant for binding people.

<Shion>
"Ke... Kei-chan,
 ......Look at that."
Shion tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to... ...a restraining table... that was clearly shaped like a person.
My spine froze...... My blood felt like it was turning into sherbet as it crawled up my back.
On each of the joints, there were things like chains and iron balls attached...
 It was like the table was searching for its next sacrifice, ready to spread their arms wide and close them in...
When I looked more closely...... there were many dark slices carved into it, as through from a knife or a saw...
They were the most clear-cut signs of usage you could ask for.
...It proved these tools weren't just for show—they were used for their original purpose.
If someone was strapped tightly onto this table... they probably wouldn't be able to move even a muscle.
...Their guts would be defenseless...... you'd take one of those eerie cooking knives lined up over there... stab them with it...
...and then you'd slice open their belly and dissect them......?

<Shion>
"......I'd heard the stories......
 ............But this is incredible........."
Before coming in here, Shion had mentioned she had a good guess of what was inside... but it seems to have exceeded her imagination.

<Takano>
"There's still more.
 ...How about it?
 More fascinating than a wax museum, isn't it?"
Takano-san had this happy expression like she was visiting a toy store for the first time.
...I don't get it.
This Miyo Takano person has nerves of steel.
Are these... these bizarre, grotesque objects... that fascinating to her?
I, for one, was not enjoying myself.
...I'll be frank.
This was all too weird for me.
 Still... there was something even more horrifying than all this.
That would be... none other than Takano-san herself.
Takano-san, holding the lantern giving off such a thin beam of light... If she suddenly turned it off...
...Then I would... What would I do when, the next moment, everything went totally dark......?
That's why I was scared.
......Takano-san had the only light... and anyway, I was scared.
...At some point, Shion had started holding onto my shirt sleeve.
It was a little annoying to walk like that, but... I didn't shake her off.
 ...That minor sensation allowed me to feel the presence of an ally, here and now......
Before we had even walked halfway through the storehouse... the air I felt on my skin changed completely.
These cruel tools lined up, all crammed together in this place...
Some were horrible ones made to take away sacrifices' freedom, and...
Some were tools made to efficiently disassemble and prepare the bodies for consumption.
...Those were just the things I understood.
There were plenty of other strange-looking objects that I couldn't even guess the purpose of.
...Now that I was here, I didn't have the slightest desire to hear the details... about what sort of terrifying reasons they were meant to be used for...
...At the very least, they were all completely different from the sort of clean, simple killing function of a katana.
Tools to kill people were, obviously, constructed in such a way that they could kill people.
If that was the goal, then the person you used them on would, obviously, end up dead.
The kinds of tools here, however, were different.
...The tools that were here...
 were for cutting people...
 for crushing them...
 for boiling them and cooking them...
 and for grinding them.
 ...They were tools of torture.
...They weren't made to kill people.
People dying was just an incidental result.
...Actually, they might not even kill them.
...If the sacrifices could die during such a horrifying ritual process, that would be nice, but...
...They don't even die in the end.
 ...They remain in a state of hellish pain... perhaps they were only being allowed to live...
Only now, in this moment, did I fully realize... just how terrifying and fearsome... that difference was.

<Takano>
"People, you see...
 Most of these wouldn't kill them, if used properly."
Takano-san, as if reading my mind, displayed a shocking smile...
......She described such horrors in a strangely medical way.
 ...Shion immediately answered the question I had.

<Shion>
"Takano-san is a nurse."
...There's a saying that nothing can scare a doctor...... I guess it's true.
Takano-san, having realized she'd scared Shion and I enough at this point, smiled soothingly.
...Then, she turned on her heel, raised the lantern, and began to walk again.
...If Takano-san left us here, we'd get even further away from the light...
Shion and I... no matter how scared we were, we were forced to follow Takano-san along on her field trip through the ritual storehouse......

<Takano>
"I suppose we've seen a bit of everything.
 See?
 This place is interesting, isn't it?"
she says, raising the lantern high in the center of the storehouse.
The dim lighting didn't change... but for some reason, it felt like I was able to see all of those horrible tools at once...

<Shion>
"Ke...... Kei-chan,
 ......look up......"
Shion stammered while grabbing the nape of my neck.

<Keiichi>
"Uh..............."
I couldn't tell because it was so dark, but... there were a lot more tools hanging from the ceiling as well.
They all looked like they were made of iron bars... but then I figured it out.
 Cages.
For cages... they were very small.
Cramped cages just for one, like a casket.
...If you got locked up in there...
 No, you wouldn't get locked up inside it.
 It was another tool meant for restraining people... where the iron bars would squeeze you tightly...
All the... so many, big and large... Things of all shapes... were hanging down...
...Takano-san's mention of execution by grilling crosses my mind...
We weren't just surrounded on all sides... by these terrifying instruments.
 Things crowding the ceiling... were even hanging over our heads...

<Takano>
"Maebara-kun, after seeing this, have you come to believe in all of it?
 The countless terrible rituals passed down in Hinamizawa?"
It's got nothing to do with believing in them.
 ......Now that I've been shown the real thing like this, there's no possible way to deny it.
......Even the nations of Europe, with all their beautiful landscapes and legends, were like a maelstrom during the terrible witch hunts in the Dark Ages.
It's well known that the era gave birth to countless gruesome forms of torture and execution.
Japan was the same way.
Didn't it have its own era of hellscape-like torturous feasts because of religious suppression and things of that nature?
...Hinamizawa itself had such a period.
 ...It had that much history behind it.
Even in Europe, land of the witch hunts—that was all far in the past, no more than a series of historical events, and in this age, nothing that abnormal would ever happen.
That must apply to Hinamizawa as well...

<Keiichi>
"...Just as Europe had its Dark Age,
 ...Hinamizawa had one too.
 ...That's how this should be taken.

<Keiichi>
...Even if these things all really happened in Hinamizawa,
 ...they're all long past.
 ...They don't have anything to do with the people living in Hinamizawa right now."

<Takano>
"Maebara-kun, you really do like this village..."
It didn't sound like she was making fun of me.
 Takano-san gave me a light smile.

<Shion>
"Takano-san, you're researching whether those customs survived into the present.
 ...You are, right?"
Shion suggested something...
 that made my heart leap into my throat.
...Are you telling me... that all these horrible things... are still going on even today?!

<Takano>
"...What I'm about to tell you is a secret, all right?
 I told you, Shion-chan, because you're an understanding person, but the other villagers don't want to hear it. 

<Takano>
...If things go awry, I could be ganged up on and punished."
Shion flashed a devilish smile, as if reveling in the immorality of it.

<Takano>
"Maebara-kun, you keep it a secret too, okay?
 If this gets out, I could suffer Oyashiro-sama's curse, or be made into a sacrifice.

<Takano>
If it's the curse, then I wonder what kind of death it'll be this year?
 ......It is tonight, you know.
 The night of Oyashiro-sama's curse."
Takano-san said, bringing her face right up close to ours.
...As if to say that if she had the choice, she'd rather suffer the curse.
 ...That was what she seemed to be implying.
Takano-san took a fairly worn notebook out of her paper bag, then began to flip through its pages...
There were all sorts of references and newspaper clippings attached to them, and it had all manner of things written inside.
The letters were very small and bunched together, so I couldn't tell at a glance what it was about.

<Takano>
"What I'd really like to do is search through the national library for newspapers from the era, but...
 ...Here it is."
......A photocopy of a page from some book was slid into the notebook, and it, too, was written in small, tight lettering.
Like the other pages, I couldn't tell what it was about just by glancing at it.

<Takano>
"This is a story that actually happened.
 It was around the end of the Meiji era.
 ...They discovered an unknown, mangled corpse, the victim of a murder, in Onigafuchi Village."
An old newspaper clipping attached to the page spoke of something that was no mere rumor or fairy tale.

<Takano>
"We don't have most police documents from the time anymore, so it's all based on oral traditions and memories.
 ......See? It's not very clear, but it looks like a cut-out of a newspaper from the Meiji era."
<i>"...Never before has there been a corpse treated with such cruelty and inhumanity / Could it be the work of a demon...?"</i>
Being a copy of a copy, it was very hard to make out, but it was more than enough to make me feel strangely tense.
Near the end of the Meiji era.
In old Onigafuchi Village, a mangled corpse was discovered.
The identity of the corpse was unknown.
 ...It wasn't even in a state where it could be identified in the first place.
It was missing a head, and each limb was separated from the body.
Skin had been peeled off the entire body, and there were markings that implied terrible torture in every place imaginable.
Not only that, but the belly had been cut open by a sharp knife, with the entrails completely dragged out.
The police immediately began an investigation, but since they couldn't even determine the identity of the victim—much less the criminal—finding answers was extremely difficult...

<Takano>
"Do you understand what it must have been like?"
I couldn't imagine such a strange sight... even if I tried.
This was the first time I was ever thankful for my lack of imagination...
 The victim surely wasn't allowed to go peacefully.
 On the contrary, they most likely had to watch the whole process... before finally being extinguished.
 What... what if that was me...?
 I couldn't even imagine it... and didn't want to, either.
As my brain was already far over capacity, however, there was no way I could imagine anything more brutal.
Then when I broke my gaze from Takano-san's... those strangely-shaped weird tools were... all around us.
I wonder if you could faithfully reproduce the mutilated corpse discovered at the end of the Meiji era... with the tools found in this place...
I want to deny it.
...I don't want to admit that something so terrible could have happened at all.
...Even so, they were so strange, so terrifying, these tools... and as if they had seen through my attempt to escape from them, they did nothing but ridicule me silently...

<Keiichi>
"So...... that creepy incident.
 ...What was it, in the end?"

<Takano>
"The author says that... regarding Onigafuchi Village's dreadful customs, they've survived into recent post-Meiji days...
 and that perhaps they lasted until around the beginning of the Showa period."
This corpse, at a glance, appeared to have been brutally killed after a period of torture...
In actuality, however... it was the pitiful sacrificial remains of the man-eaters' terrifying feast...
 ......The corpse was just leftovers...
It was so fantastic, so strange, that it didn't feel real.
 ...Was this an extension of the legends, too...?
...It happened in the Meiji era, though, which is just too recent to be called a 'legend'...
Also...... there's a newspaper clipping right here suggesting it......

<Keiichi>
"O-Okay, but... even if it really happened... it was a long time ago, right?
 I mean, the Meiji era ended a hundred years ago..."

<Takano>
"That's all.
 ...Only a hundred years ago.
 Besides.
 It kept happening even after the beginning of the Showa period.
 ...Like with the uproar around the post-war
 canned flesh incident,
 ......Oh, I apologize. 

<Takano>
That story was taboo, wasn't it...?"
Takano-san immediately stopped talking as if worried about Shion.
...Shion briefly looked somewhat angry, but that expression soon disappeared.

<Keiichi>
"......Huh?
 Takano-san, what did you just say?
 Canned flesh...?"
Just then, there was a huge CREAAAAAKING noise!!!
Everyone whipped around to look!!
...It was Tomitake-san, who had opened the door slightly.

<Tomitake>
"Ah-ha-ha-ha.
 Did I startle you?"

<Takano>
"Oh, Jirou-san, could you not resist seeing inside?"

<Tomitake>
"I'll pass on that.
 ...Ahahaha...
 I'm bad with this sort of thing by nature."
Takano-san held her stomach and had to muffle her laughter, as if she wanted to make a comment about his masculinity.

<Tomitake>
"In any case.
 The dance and ceremony are over, and everyone's going down to the stream.
 The festival will be over within minutes."

<Takano>
"Oh, that's no good.
 Maebara-kun is just such a good listener that I couldn't help telling stories."
...I'd really rather you not mention me in a place like this.

<Takano>
"Jirou-san, could you wait out front?
 I want to take a few pictures.
 There are actually a lot of tools I'd like to bring home, but we obviously can't do that."
Takano-san took a camera out of her paper bag and began to snap photographs.
......She looked like she was having fun, like she was on a scavenger hunt.

<Tomitake>
"Hm?
 Keiichi-kun, are you leaving too?"

<Keiichi>
"......I've seen enough.
 ...Shion, you're good too, right?
 Let's get out of here.
 ...I want some fresh air."

<Shion>
"I agree.
 Let's leave."
I did feel a bit of hesitation at leaving Takano-san by herself in this darkness...
When I thought about it, though, I realized that whatever kinds of evil spirits and ghosts lurked in the darkness, none of them could hold a candle to how scary she was.
Even if a phantasm were to appear, she'd be overjoyed and flash her camera at it.
It seemed like Shion shared my somewhat-rude mental images.
 We exchanged glances and smiled painfully.
We left Takano-san there, bathed in her strobe of camera flashes, and decided to go leave the ritual storehouse.
Everyone at the festival seemed to have gone to the stream, so their voices were very distant.
The voices of the bugs, on the other hand, were clear... lending an empty feeling of isolation to the place.

<Tomitake>
"How was it?
 Interesting?"
Tomitake-san gave us a somewhat mischievous grin.
He should have been able to tell by looking at how pale our faces were.

<Keiichi>
"...I should have kept watch outside with you, Tomitake-san."

<Tomitake>
"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"
Tomitake-san laughed so delightfully that it wiped away our dark feelings.

<Tomitake>
"How did you fare, Shion-chan?
 Were you scared?"

<Shion>
"...I was prepared for it, so I wasn't too afraid, but...
 seeing the real thing was... powerful."
Shion spoke like she wasn't scared at all.
...She really had been quite afraid, but seeing as how I was in way worse a state than her, I didn't have much room to talk.
As Tomitake-san grinned candidly, my mind, exhausted and locked up by nervousness began to calm itself...

<Tomitake>
"Was Takano-san an adult about this little expedition?
 You know how she seems like a child sometimes.
 I was worried she'd be way too excited."
Both Shion and I laughed, and left that as our answer.

<Tomitake>
"Hopefully she was only looking at things.
 I'm worried she'll sneak something out of there, or mess with a ritual implement too much and break it or something."
...Right, that's quite possible.
...She is alone in there right now.
She might pilfer something small and easily concealed, hiding it in her pocket.

<Shion>
"Ahahahaha, yeah.
 I can see that."
Shion said what I was thinking.

<Tomitake>
"You're sure she didn't break anything?
 I could clearly hear some noises like someone jumping up and down.
 I was getting pretty nervous..."

<Takano>
"I'm sorry.
 I ran out of film.
 Jirou-san, if you have any more, could I use some?"
Takano-san suddenly appeared while we were talking about her, taking everyone by surprise.
Tomitake-san smoothly grinned and responded as if nothing had happened.
 ...He's pretty mature.

<Tomitake>
"Ah, ah-ha-ha-ha!
 I'm all out of spare film.
 Sorry about that..."

<Takano>
"...Geez.
 You won't win any Pulitzer Prizes by not stocking enough film for any occasion, you know.
 ...I suppose that's it, then..."
Tomitake-san scratched his head apologetically.
Without film, we're done here.
...Takano-san seemed to have given up because of that, too.
We checked carefully to make sure we hadn't left anything inside, then closed the door and turned to the heavy padlock we'd left beside it.

<Tomitake>
"Takano-san... You didn't sneak anything out, right...?"

<Takano>
"How rude.
 I'm trying not to be <i>that</i> childish."
Ker-clack.
Tomitake set the padlock back to the way it was before.
...From a cursory glance, it didn't look like thieves had snuck in at all.

<Tomitake>
"Okay.
 Let's get over to the stream ourselves.
 If we don't at least set some cotton afloat, there won't be any point in coming to the festival!"
Tomitake-san spoke brightly, urging us all on.
...Setting cotton afloat down the stream...
...I shake my head a few times, driving away my dismal thoughts as to the double meaning.
Takano-san, looking a little let down, kept turning back to glance at the ritual storehouse.

<Tomitake>
"Let's just leave it at that, all right?
 You saw enough to sate your curiosity, didn't you?"

<Takano>
"Oh, not at all!
 Everything I found only renewed my interests.
 All those stories and legends suddenly hold water.
 After today, I'm going to have to change the way I look at all this!"
Wow... She's truly indomitable.
Her curiosity really is something else—still interested in all this, through and through...
We descended the stone stairs and all the people crowding the stream came into view.
Near the bottom of the stairs, we could clearly see people receiving cotton that had been cut out for them, then wishing upon the cotton and setting it afloat down the stream.
...The festival was already over.

<Tomitake>
"Damn.
 I missed my chance to photograph the best part of Watanagashi."

<Takano>
"Oh, but it's not too late.
 I'm going to go and set some afloat.
 Perhaps you could take pictures of me?"
Takano-san, with an impish expression, brought her head to Tomitake-san's shoulder.
Despite his age, he looked embarrassed...
I felt an honest respect for Tomitake-san, man to man, for dating such a handful of a woman...

<Takano>
"Good bye, then.
 Maebara-kun.
 Shion-chan."

<Tomitake>
"We're going down to the stream.
 Would you like to come with us?"

<Shion>
"No, no.
 I couldn't get in your way.
 Please, take your time~"
Shion waved her hand to them with an expression just as impish as Takano-san's.
...Tomitake-san, on his part, seemed to want us to come... but whatever...
Shion gave a big stretch and sat down on the stone steps.

<Shion>
"Ehehe...
 I'm pretty worn out."

<Keiichi>
"...Same here.
 ......I'm exhausted too."

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, this is your first Watanagashi, isn't it?
 You go on. Don't mind me.
 I'm tired, so I'd like to stay away from the crowd."
Yeah, if we were to go now, we'd barely slip into the end of the cotton-drifting ceremony.

<Shion>
"My sister and your other friends might be looking for you, too.
 Go on."

<Keiichi>
"Oh... yeah, right.
 They've been by themselves ever since we got separated.
 I'd feel bad if they were looking for me..."
Then, Shion suddenly got a playful look on her face, then put her index finger to her lips as if telling me to keep this a secret.

<Shion>
"My sister is the type that gets really jealous.
 If she knew I was hogging you this whole time, she'd never let me hear the end of it, so keep tonight a secret, okay?"
...Keep tonight a secret...
......Don't say things that are so embarrassing!

<Shion>
"Not only because of that, either.

<Shion>
...Considering what we were doing tonight, we really need to keep it secret.
 ...Oyashiro-sama's curse might happen tonight... and we four would be the prime candidates."
The loosening threads of tension became taut again.
Shion, however, burst out laughing.

<Shion>
"All right, I'm going to get out of here before I run into my sister.
 I really am tired, so I don't have the endurance to put up with her anyway."

<Keiichi>
"I can't tell if you get along with her or not."

<Shion>
"We... get along."
Though as she said that, her vague expression explained that there are a lot of oddities in a relationship between twins.

<Keiichi>
"I'm an only child, so I don't really get it.
 Make sure you get along with her, okay?"

<Shion>
"Right. Thank you kindly for your meddling.
 ...Okay, I'm gonna go.
 You should hurry up if you want to make it, Kei-chan.
 Watanagashi really is about to end."
Shion stood up and brushed the dust off her backside.
After watching her do so, I returned my eyes to the final ceremony of the Watanagashi Festival below me.

<Shion>
"Seriously, though...
 ...What was that sound, anyway?
 It was kind of unpleasant and creepy."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 What sound?"

<Shion>
"..................The sound.

 You know, the banging noise.
 ...It was really loud, wasn't it?"
I was giving her a blank expression, so Shion stared hard at me.
 I stared hard at her, too.

<Keiichi>
"Sorry, Shion.
 ......Could you give me the short version?
 What was making noise?"

<Shion>
"......Wait, Kei-chan...
 ...It didn't bother you?"

When all's said and done,
 it was like we were speaking two different languages.

<Keiichi>
"Shion.
 ...Explain it to me, without jokes, from the beginning, will you?
 What's this about a noise?"

<Shion>
"...Kei-chan, you quit joking around too.
 ......Really, honestly... it didn't bother you?"
Neither of us was giving any ground,
and both of us were staring at the other in disbelief.
We were answering questions with more questions, with no sign of an actual conversation in sight.
Baffled, I held in the urge to shout at her... and asked politely one more time.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm going to ask one more time, okay?
 I'll ask the questions."
Shion nodded silently.

<Keiichi>
"...Okay, here goes.
 ...You said there was a sound. What are you talking about?"

<Shion>
"The banging sound.
 It was like a kid was jumping up and down on floorboards, somewhere far away.
 ...It really didn't bother you...?"

<Keiichi>
"...There was nothing to be bothered by.
 ...When did you hear this?
 I never heard anything."

<Shion>
"Wait, Kei-chan... are you... are you serious?"
Shion, as if she didn't understand my plain and simple answer, pressed me further, her expression serious.
......I have no clue what she's talking about, but if it has Shion acting so like this... Whatever it was, it gave me the creeps, and sent a chill down my spine.

<Shion>
"It was while we were looking around the inside of the ritual storehouse with Takano-san.
 ...About the time she started her stories, I think it was?
 Little by little.
 Louder and louder.
 Off and on..."
She heard a banging sound, like a child jumping on distant floorboards...?

<Keiichi>
"That can't be true.
 Don't start trying to scare me after all that!"
I didn't hear anything at all.
...In fact, it was so utterly silent in there that my own heartbeat was almost deafening.

<Shion>
"Please don't try to scare me either, Kei-chan.
 ...It was like something was making noise in time with Takano-san's scary stories, and... I was totally creeped out the whole time."
......The chill rose from my spine to the back of my head.
...My blood turned cold as it crawled up my body.
When it reached my head, my mind froze over...

<Shion>
"You and Takano-san weren't paying any attention to it at all, so... I pretended not to hear it either, but...
 ...You heard it, right?
 It happened a bunch of times, and it was really loud."
...Shion's eyes were begging me to tell her I heard it.
...I had no doubt, however, that my own eyes suggested something entirely different—a 'you've gotta be kidding' look.
......In that storehouse, we were surrounded by brutal ritual tools that looked like they were from another planet, listening to terrifying old stories.
...The whole time, Shion had been hearing a sound that we couldn't hear, by herself.
...Should that make Shion, who heard it, tremble, or should it make me, who didn't hear it, tremble... I didn't know the answer to that at the time.
...For now, Shion seemed to have made that decision before I did.

<Shion>
"Ah...... ahahahahahaha."

<Keiichi>
"What are you laughing about..."

<Shion>
"I really got you, Kei-chan.
 I was fibbing the whole time!"

<Keiichi>
".........Whaaatt?!?!"
Shion laughed, saying how easily scared I was, and clapped me on the back.
...Her smile seemed somehow artificial, and actually made me feel worse.
Then, after leaving me with two or three generic, diplomatic goodbye phrases, she left, almost like she was running away.
All I could do was look after her... my mouth agape.
...At the end of the day...
 ...I didn't have a clue what was going on.
Shion laughed it off and said she had been lying, but...
 ...she couldn't possibly have been lying.
Of course not.
And now that I think back... Tomitake-san said the same thing, didn't he?

<Tomitake>
"I could clearly hear some noises like someone jumping up and down.
 I was getting pretty nervous..."
Tomitake-san, the most neutral party present at the time, had said he'd heard something.
......Then...... that noise...
 ...It was real...?
The banging sounds.
Sounds as though a child was jumping up and down on some kind of floorboards, far away.
Oyashiro-sama's curse... which happens every year, might happen again tonight.
The most plausible victim candidates were Takano-san, Tomitake-san, Shion... and me.
The bustling of the people sounded further away than I would have liked, and the sounds of the insects sounded too close for comfort.
...I'm near so much human warmth... and yet I can't ever go back there again.
......That was the ominous idea that sprouted in my mind.
Then, all of a sudden, I was pounced on from behind, causing my heart to lurch!!

<Rika>
"......Keiichi, we fooound you."
It was Rika-chan.
 ...When I turned round, Mion and Rena were there too.

<Mion>
"...We finally found you.
 Now we just need to find Satoko."

<Rena>
"Everyone got split up this year.
 We should make sure we have somewhere to meet up afterwards next year. Hau."

<Mion>
"You're right.
 It's a festival, so we should all be together!"
I listened to Mion's happy declaration with a little bit of guilt.

<Rika>
"......Keiichi, did you root for me while I was dancing?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, yeah!
 I saw it all!
 You did a great job, all the way through.
 No mistakes, either."

<Rika>
".............................."

<Rena>
"...Yeah.
 That's right, Rika-chan.
 That didn't count as a mistake~"
I tensed up as I realized I'd made a mistake of my own...
Mion slapped a hand onto my shoulder a little roughly.
 ...A gross sweat broke out over my whole body.

<Mion>
"...Did you do it too, Kei-chan?
 Did you get some cotton and send it down the stream?"
...You haven't yet, right?
 is what I could feel her saying.
...Without the courage to tell any more lies... I lifelessly shook my head.

<Rena>
"Huh?
 You haven't, Keiichi-kun?
 You should go now or it'll be over!
 It'll be over!"

<Keiichi>
"S-Sorry...
 This is my first Watanagashi, so...
 I don't really understand the rules and stuff..."

<Mion>
".........That's right.
 I'm sorry."
Mion took my hand and we started walking down the stone steps.

<Mion>
"...Hey, Kei-chan."

<Keiichi>
"What...?"

<Mion>
"Did you see Shion?"
My heart skipped another beat.
...Maybe Mion could sense my surprise through my hand.

<Keiichi>
"N-No...... Oh, well...
 ...I sort of think I saw her......
 You two look so alike, though... so it might have been you..."

<Mion>
"...You wouldn't have gotten that wrong.
 We're wearing different clothes."

<Keiichi>
"Huh? ......Oh... ...that's right......"
Mion's momentary silence was like a deathgrip upon me...

<Mion>
"...I just can't do anything about that Shion!
 Well, it's her we're talking about, so we can just leave her be."
Mion's expression returned to her former, usual smile, and we continued down the stone steps, her firmly pulling my hand along...



[Watanagashi Ch.9]

I let out a great big yawn.
It was like morning had arrived just as I got to sleep...
As Mom set up breakfast, she gave me a pained smile.

<Keiichi's mom>
"What's the matter, Keiichi?
 What time did you go to sleep last night?"

<Keiichi>
"Well, I wanted to go to sleep at midnight... but I had some trouble with that..."

<Keiichi's mom>
"You were probably all worked up from the festival."

<Keiichi>
"N-No, that's not it...! Crunch crunch!"
I crunched down hard on the pickled radish to hide my embarrassment.
...After all that happened yesterday, and our discussion about the sound Shion heard...
...That banging noise, like a child far away, jumping up and down on a wooden floor.
The story wouldn't get out of my head, so I had trouble sleeping...
It was a long night...
 ...and I kept jumping at the slight sounds of faraway tree branches, which should have been either unhearable or too insignificant to notice.
When I woke up to the morning sunlight and birds chirping, it made me feel pretty ashamed about it, but...
...I felt far from refreshed this morning.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kuuun! Good morning!
 Huh?
 Keiichi-kun, your eyes are all red!
 Why is that? Why?"

<Keiichi>
"Oh, hey, good morning.
 I didn't get much sleep last night.
 So I'm sleep deprived today.
 ...*yaaawn*"

<Rena>
"The festival yesterday was a lot of fun...!
 Rena's excitement took a long time to go to sleep, so I took a long time to go to sleep too! To sleep!"
In Rena's case, her excitement seemed to still be wide awake...

<Rena>
"They should have this kind of festival more often!
 So we can have lots of fun together again. Hau!"

<Keiichi>
"Mm, ah... Yeah."
Rena talking about the festival yesterday made me remember everything I had nearly forgotten from last night.
...The inside of the ritual storehouse had been so utterly different from the relaxed, bright everyday life of Hinamizawa.
All those stories that Takano-san told me, too...
The mysterious incidents that occurred on the day of the Watanagashi Festival every year.
The strange incidents where one person would die, and one would disappear.
...The old stories of Hinamizawa, flickering like a candle behind them.
 The numerous and horrifying traditions of Onigafuchi Village.
The villagers with demon blood in them.
The terrible, cannibalistic feasts.
The poor sacrifices kidnapped from human villages, victims...
 ...of the Onikakushi.
To quell the rage of Oyashiro-sama... the ritual involving living sacrifices.
......There were also many, many others.
 ...There were so many stories that just remembering them put me in a foul mood.
Most of them weren't fiction, either—they were true.
...We didn't need to fear them just because they were real, though.
 ...Since it all happened so long ago.
 Such a very long time ago.

<Rena>
"Where's Mii-chan? She's late."

<Keiichi>
"Huh...?"
Before I realized it, we had arrived at the place where we'd usually meet with Mion.
...Probably because I was so lost in thought.

<Rena>
"We agreed that if she isn't here by now, we can just go on ahead, right?
 ...Should we?"
Mion being late wasn't too rare an occurrence... but today she was unusually late.
......A few of the ominous tales from the night before came back to life in my mind again.
Who would die this year, and who would disappear...
......I-It couldn't have been... Mion...?

<Rena>
"What should we do, Keiichi-kun?
 ...If we don't get going, we'll be late."

<Keiichi>
"...She'll be here.
 She didn't call to tell us she'd be staying home today, right?
 Let's just wait five more minutes. Okay?"
Rena looked at her watch and seemed a little worried, but then she nodded with a satisfied smile.
Hmm...
If we had to wait five minutes, we'd have to run as fast as we could to school or we'd be late...
As soon as I thought that, we spotted Mion, running towards us, out of breath.

<Rena>
"Mii-chaaaaan!!
 You're laaaate!!"

<Mion>
"Hah!
 Hah!
 ...You waited?
 Y-You should have just gone on ahead..."
...Mion was breathing heavily, and her face was all red.
...Her house was right down this road, wasn't it?
 It wasn't far enough away for her to end up like this, was it?

<Rena>
"......Mii-chan,
 ...Are you not feeling well?"
Huh?
 ...Now that she mentioned it...
...Rena pushed Mion's bangs away and put her hand to her forehead.

<Mion>
"...Rena, your hand is pretty cold."

<Rena>
"Mii-chan... You're a little bit warm."

<Mion>
"It's no big deal.
 ...Give it half a day and I'll be fit as a fiddle."

<Keiichi>
"Are you really okay?
 ...You don't have to push yourself, you know."

<Mion>
"What's this?
 Kei-chan, are you worried about me?
 Ahaha... That's nice of you."
...That answer wasn't like Mion at all.
...She must have had it pretty bad.

<Rena>
"I-I just think you shouldn't push yourself so hard.
 We can tell the teacher you had to take the day off."

<Mion>
"I'm fine, I'm fine!
 I took some medicine.
 I think it's already working."
Mion forced an energetic expression onto her face and flexed her biceps at us.

<Keiichi>
"Okay... then let's go.
 Don't overdo it... but, of course, there's...
 ...the time."

<Rena>
"Wah?!
 W-We need to run or we won't m-make it~!!"

<Mion>
"Ah-hahahaha!
 This morning sure is thrilling!
 Maybe it's just what I need to shake off this slowness!
 Let's run!"
Hey, wait... You're sick! Don't go overboard...!
Mion began to run vigorously anyway.

<Rena>
"...Mii-chan is older than us, right?
 She knows her own body better than anyone."
I decided to leave it at that and assume she was fine.

<Keiichi>
"Great, then we should get going too!!"
We began to run after Mion...
The school looked the same as always.
The hours passed listlessly, and my lack of sleep took its toll...
If there was a sport where people competed by sleeping, I'd be world champion right now.
The trick to overcoming this sort of dangerous situation was to hold your pencil upside-down.
...Why, you ask?
So you don't draw strange patterns all over your notes while half-asleep.
If you were holding your pencil upside-down, that wouldn't happen, would it?
Bump bump bump!
 Bump bump bump!
Something that felt like an eraser hit me in the head six times.

<Keiichi>
"Ow, ow... What was that for, Satoko?!"

<Satoko>
"I-I haven't done a single thing...!"

<Keiichi>
"Who else would play a prank on me like this?!
 Oh, it was chalk, not an eraser.
 ......Eh?"
Behind me... like a female outlaw might hold razors, was the teacher's shadow, holding three pieces of chalk in each hand...
 Rumble rumble rumble......

<Chie>
"Maebara-kun.
 ...Go and wash your face."

<Keiichi>
"Uh,
 ......R-Right,
 g-gladly...!"
That alone was enough to wake me up... but I flew out into the hallway, as if shoved out by the pressure exuded by the teacher's sheer power.
If I was going to wash my face anyway, then I would rather use the sinks out front, rather than the ones in the dark restroom.
 ...Thinking that, I left the hallway and went to the entrance.
The sunlight was strong.
 ...So strong you wouldn't think it was June.
I turned the faucet, and with a lifeless bubbling noise, lukewarm water came pouring out.
...If I let it run for a few moments, would it get cold?
...I looked at it absent-mindedly for a little while.

<Mion>
"I knew you'd choose these sinks, Kei-chan.
 The ones out front just feel better, don't they?"

<Keiichi>
"Hm... Mion?
 ...*Yaaawn*
 No cutting class now~"
I stuck my hands into the water to find it had gotten so cold that it seemed strange it had ever been warm.
I scooped it up and splashed it against my face.
Once I was done, I moved out of the way and Mion did the same.

<Keiichi>
"...Mion, how is your cold doing?
 You're sleepy because of the medicine, not from lack of sleep, right?"

<Mion>
"Hm?
 ...Ahahahaha. Actually, this is a secret, but... after the festival yesterday, I got wrapped up in the party my relatives were having.
 And well... things dragged on a while."
Things dragged on?
So, you mean to say...
 ...You didn't have a cold or anything...

<Keiichi>
"So you really are just tired?!
 If you were up all night, just say so! That was confusing..."

<Mion>
"Nahahaha...!
 Give me a break.
 I really don't feel well, you know!"
...I suppose she'd be feeling lousy either way.
 Still, you treat colds and sleep deprivation in completely different ways.

<Keiichi>
"I was worried over nothing.
 Man... I guess that's just like you, Mion..."
Mion scratched her head, a little embarrassed.
...She didn't seem to be feeling well, but now that I knew the cause, I didn't need to worry too much.
 It would go away with a little rest, after all.

<Mion>
"Oh, but my head really is pounding, so
 the teacher told me I should go home early."

<Keiichi>
"Ack, you cheater...!
 So are you going home now, Mion?"
Now that I looked again, Mion had her bag with her. She must have been on her way home.

<Mion>
"Yep. I feel bad about it, though.
 I'll get some rest at home like a good girl.
 ...Sorry I can't make it to the club.
 Would you take over as leader for today, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"......I don't know if that will happen.
 We have that unspoken rule where we don't do the club unless everyone is there, don't we?
 We never did it when you had to go to your part-time job, did we?"
Mion laughed wryly, saying we didn't need to worry about her.
No matter how much fun we have, though, I think that feeling guilty about friends who can't share in it is the sign of a really fantastic friendship.
In that sense, the club Mion has created is a wonderful thing.
As I thought about it, the moisture on my washed face dried up.
...I suppose we were talking too much.
 If I didn't get back to the classroom soon, I could get in trouble.

<Keiichi>
"Okay, later.
 I'm going back.
 Be careful on your way home.
 Don't wobble into a sewer or a brook, got it?"
I left it at that, turned around, and started heading back to the classroom.

<Mion>
"Oh, ...One more thing, Kei-chan."
Mion stopped me, and I turned my head to listen.

<Keiichi>
"What's up?"

<Mion>
"This may sound weird, but don't think too hard about it."

<Keiichi>
"Well, that depends on what it is."

<Mion>
"Last night, near the end of the festival.
 ...Did you see Tomitake-san or Takano-san anywhere?"

......I suddenly tensed up.

<Mion>
"You know Tomitake-san and Takano-san, right?
 You remember, Kei-chan, when the four of you were talking during setup the day before?"
If I could, I wanted to forget about sneaking into the storehouse that night as soon as possible.
...So hearing the names of the people I was with at the time really got to me.
...Besides that, though.
...Why was Mion... asking me a question like that...?
I ended up staring at her, unable to answer immediately...
...Was she asking to see if I had seen them or not, or was she asking the question knowing that I had...? I couldn't tell.

<Keiichi>
"......W-Well... Maybe?
 ...I might have seen them around, I don't know..."
My vague response was clearly not to Mion's liking.
...What answer was she expecting from me...? There was no way for me to know.

<Mion>
"............I see.
 Then, one more question.
 On the same night,
 did you see Shion?"

My heart leapt into my throat again.
 ......The tiny needles buried underneath Mion's words pricked into me.

<Keiichi>
"...That... didn't you ask me that yesterday?
 ...I think I told you that I wasn't sure if I had or not..."

<Mion>
"Hm, did you?
 ...I guess I just thought I'd get a different answer if I asked you again."
I suddenly noticed something in Mion's eyes... something indescribable.
Tomitake-san and Takano-san.
Shion, too.
...She was asking me about them.
......There was no doubt about it.
...Last night, the four of us snuck into the ritual storehouse... she knew everything.
...S-So... So what?!
 There's not really a curse anyway......!
...That's right.
Even Shion and Takano-san said yesterday during the festival that there was no curse.
...And that rather than a curse, it was the doing of the villagers...
 ..................................My blood curdled.
...Mion was...
 ...almost without a doubt...
 ...aware that we snuck into the storehouse...?
It was nothing strange.
......I screwed up bad flipping on the light switch last night.
...If Mion had been searching for me, it was simple to imagine... that she had seen that momentary light and come to find out what was going on.

<Mion>
"...Did you really not see her?"

<Keiichi>
"W-Why are you so intent on knowing if I did or not?"

<Mion>
"It's not important.
 ...It's just that there are some people...
 ...who are speaking poorly of Tomitake-san, Takano-san, Shion, and you, Kei-chan.
 ......I didn't really hear what they were saying, though."
Unpleasant sweat dripped down my arms... and the sound of it hanging from my fingertips was so annoyingly loud...

<Mion>
"I don't believe that you were doing something bad.
 ...I just wanted to ask a bit about it, so I did.
 ...Sorry for making you uncomfortable, okay?"
......I found myself unable to reply.
...My reaction must have made it obvious what the truth was... and yet I couldn't explain myself.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, you weren't with Tomitake-san, Takano-san, or Shion.
 ...Right?"

<Keiichi>
"......Um.
 ......Yeah."
I finally wrung out an answer between ragged breaths. Mion's expression softened a little.

<Mion>
"...That's good.
 I'll have to tell them.
 You weren't involved in anything bad, Kei-chan,
 so... I'll make sure to tell everyone."
...Yeah... please do.
...Tell them I wasn't... doing anything bad.
...To everyone... make sure...
 ......Everyone.
 ......Everyone... who is everyone...?

<Mion>
"Okay, later.
 I'll be better tomorrow!
 Bye-bye!"
W-Wait, Mion!!
 What do you mean by 'everyone'...?!!
Just then!!
 A freezing cold hand touched the back of my neck!!!!

<Chie>
"Hey!
 You're late, Maebara-kun.
 How long does it take you to wash your face?"
......It was the teacher.
...I was taking so long she came out to get me...

<Keiichi>
"Ah, I'm sorry...
 I was just speaking to Mion......"
I turned around, but Mion had crossed through the schoolyard without me realizing it and was now standing at the gate.

<Chie>
"Come, back to your studies!
 Quickly now."
The teacher was being insistent. We returned to the entrance.
...I looked back one more time, and Mion was nowhere in sight.

<Rika>
"......Keiichi, you haven't seemed well all day."

<Satoko>
"It's clearly because he had far too much fun yesterday!"

<Keiichi>
"I don't want to be told that by the one who got lost. Your face was all red and you were nearly crying!"

<Rena>
"Ah, ahahahaha~!!
 S-Satoko-chan was so...so kyuute last night! Hau~!!"
My friends did their best to try and cheer me up... but it didn't lighten my mood.
Was it far worse than I thought?
 ...Had I really done something that terrible last night...?
These thoughts remained with me... for the rest of the day.

<Rena>
"...Bye, Keiichi-kun.
 I'll see you tomorrow!"
By the time I realized it, I was in front of my own house.

<Rena>
"...Mii-chan had a cold, right?
 ...Could you have a cold too, Keiichi-kun? Could you?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh? ...I'm fine.
 I may look scrawny, but I've never missed school because of a cold!"

<Rena>
"Both you and Mii-chan didn't look so good today, though..."

<Keiichi>
"...Thanks for worrying about me.
 I'm fine! Idiots don't catch colds, remember?"
Rena smiled, then waved to me and left.
...Hoo.
...With my shoulders bobbing up and down from breathing heavily, I entered the house.
As soon as I got back in, Mom called out to me.

<Keiichi>
"What?"

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi?
 I'm sorry, but could you go to the library and return a few books for me?"

<Keiichi>
"...Huh? I don't feel like it...!"

<Keiichi's mom>
"Your dad and I have to wait inside the house for a phone call right now, so we can't leave.
 I need to return them today. Could you please do it?"
......Sheesh.
Did it have to do with Dad's job?
 No point in arguing if they bring that up.

<Keiichi>
"I guess so... but
 I don't know where the library is."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Oh, you don't?
 It's a little bit past Okinomiya Station..."
Just then, the phone rang.
My parents' faces immediately turned grim.
 ...Mom snatched up the receiver.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Hello!
 Maebara speaking.
 ......
 I'm sorry?
 Yes. He's right here."
Then she thrust the receiver at my face.

<Keiichi's mom>
"It's for you, Keiichi.
 Don't take too long, okay?"
I tried to ask who it was from, but asking the person on the phone directly would be faster.

<Keiichi>
"Hello?"

<Shion>
"Ah... This is Sonozaki. Well, the younger one.
 Hello.
 Do you have time to talk right now?"
It was Shion.
...The older sister shattered from an all nighter, but the younger seemed fine.

<Keiichi>
"Shion?
 I thought you'd be catching up on your sleep today, same as Mion."

<Shion>
"What?
 Is Mion playing truant today?
 Ah-hahahaha! That's so like her~~!"
She laughed warmly, but Mom glared at me, silently telling me to finish up.

<Keiichi>
"......Whoops... sorry.
 My parents are waiting for an important call, so I can't talk for too long.
 ...What do you need?"

<Shion>
"...There's something I wanted to talk about... but if we can't talk long, I guess that's that..."
She sounded a little disappointed.
...What would Shion want to talk to me about?
 Now I was interested.

<Keiichi>
"Then how about we meet in person?
 If you could show me where the library is too, that would be great."

<Shion>
"You mean the public library near the station?
 Yes, that's fine.
 I go past there on my way to work anyway."

<Keiichi>
"Okay, then you know where I usually meet up with Mion?
 At that intersection where the small path from the Sonozaki house splits—"

<Shion>
"Oh, Kei-chan,
 did I not tell you?
 I don't live at the main house; I live in Okinomiya.
 If we could meet by the ticket machines at Okinomiya Station, that would be great."
Main house?
Living in Okinomiya?
......Now that she mentioned it, it's always seemed like the Sonozaki sisters weren't communicating... did they live in different houses?
Also now that she mentioned it, Rena said she'd never met the younger sister, despite going over to play sometimes.

<Keiichi>
"Let's meet at the station, then.
 I'll go there right away.
 Bye!"
I set the receiver down, and Mom immediately thrust a large pile of library books in my face.
...Six volumes of long-form mystery novels.
 ...Mom had her own hobbies.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Thank you, Keiichi.
 Be back by nightfall."

<Keiichi>
"Got it.
 Okay, I'm going."
I supposed I'd change my clothes and grab my bike key.
I climbed the stairs to my bedroom.
Shion had been waiting for me already, so meeting up was a smooth process.

<Keiichi>
"Wow, Mion never keeps her appointments...
 I mean, honestly."

<Shion>
"Ahahahaha.
 Making my sister the standard for everything will get you in trouble."
Hm?
Shion seemed a little unsteady too.
 ...She was up all night with Mion, wasn't she?

<Keiichi>
"You didn't get any sleep last night either, did you?
 Don't try and hide it!
 You definitely went home from school early."

<Shion>
"Ooh, too bad!
 I've been at home all day in the first place.
 I'm smarter than Mion, after all."
Hey...
I don't think you can call playing hooky 'smarter'...

<Shion>
"You should finish your errand first.
 We don't have that much time.
 ...We're going to the library, right?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, thanks.
 My mom had to return some books by today.
 ...Is the library far?"

<Shion>
"No, it's really close by."
As she said that, we spotted the signboard for the library almost immediately.
If it was this easy to find, then I guess I didn't need Shion to show me where it was after all...
We rode around a bend and the building was right there.
Shishibone Public Library.
We lived in the country, so I hadn't expected too much... but it was pretty big.
The first floor was actually a government office, so the library was only on the second floor, but it still looked large enough to fit a decent collection of books.
We passed through the automatic doors and were greeted by the cool breeze of an air curtain.
The cicadas had been loud outside, but it was quiet inside the library.
The air conditioning inside was keeping the temperature at an ideal level for the books, which had that mildewy smell unique to old paper...

<Keiichi>
"...I guess every library is basically the same."
If there was one difference... it was that people studying for tests weren't taking up all the seats.
I was one of those people, but now that seemed like a distant memory.

<Keiichi>
"Hello, I have books I'd like to return."
The librarian went through the process of checking them in, and then returned my Mom's library card.
Shion was going around the bookshelves with a deeply interested look on her face, like she wasn't the type who went to libraries very often.

<Keiichi>
"...Sorry for the wait.
 I'm all done."

<Shion>
"Libraries sure are nice and cool, aren't they~
 I want to work in a library one day."

<Keiichi>
"Don't know whether to call that boring or dependable... It's a pretty small dream compared to your sister."
Mion would definitely want to be a hardworking employee for an international trading company, or some other crazy job that involved her running all around the world.
Compared to that... what Shion said is pretty heart-warming.

<Shion>
"Well, we need to keep our differences dear to us.
 We're not copies—we're two different people, called Shion and Mion."

<Keiichi>
"...Twins have a lot to think about, huh?
 Still, it sounds like fun.
 ...I don't have any brothers, so there's just me and my parents at my house.
 It can get a little uncomfortable."

<Shion>
"It's the same for me.
 I don't live with Mion, after all."
Oh, right, she said something like that, didn't she...
 Why, though?
 Sisters living apart is unusual.
We were getting tired of talking while we were walking.
...We ended up going to the lounge area, which was vacant, and continuing the conversation.

<Shion>
"Ahahahaha.
 Yes.
 Mion lives at the main house, and I live in Okinomiya."

<Keiichi>
"What do you mean by 'main house'?
 ...You make it sound like you're nobility."

<Shion>
"It's just the main house.
 The Sonozaki family's main house.
 Mion's the successor, so she lives with Nana and apparently studies all sorts of things as preparation to be the head of the family."
Mion... the head of the family?
It kind of fit her personality, but kind of didn't, too...

<Shion>
"Kei-chan, you just moved here, right?
 ...This will sound like I'm boasting, but we of the Sonozaki family are kind of personages around here."

<Keiichi>
"Huh? ...Seriously?"
The word "personage" didn't really match the extremely sociable air that Mion and Shion gave off.
From what Shion explained... The Sonozaki family goes way back to the beginnings of Hinamizawa. After the war, they had a bunch of successful ventures and extended their influence to a wide area.

<Shion>
"The Sonozaki house is a foundation under which the entire family cooperates.
 ...Though the current family head, Grandma, was the one who built it."
The entire family would provide backup to help one relative with a business venture...
 They were like a huge, living company.
This let them avoid tax-related problems and help relatives' ventures succeed, one after another, using large amounts of money.

<Shion>
"If you ever go for a walk through Okinomiya, pay attention to the signboards and stuff.
 There's a ton of shops that are managed by members of the Sonozaki family."

<Keiichi>
"...Now that you mention it...
 That toy store looked like it was managed by relatives as well.
 Does that mean your relatives operate Angel Mort too?"
...Even what few shops I was familiar with were involved with the Sonozaki family...
 It was definitely surprising.

<Shion>
"The family is particularly strong in finance and real estate.
 Even a lot of members of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry either have the last name Sonozaki, or are their relatives. 

<Shion>
There are Sonozakis in the city council and the prefectural assembly, too, since they have the Okinomiya area giving them strong electoral support."

<Keiichi>
"......Wait a minute.
 ...This is all... escalating pretty quickly."
Her relatives operate shops in downtown Okinomiya, and they're especially strong in finance and real estate...?
On top of that, a lot of those in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry are relatives, and there are even people elected to local offices...

<Keiichi>
"...So then...
 ......The Sonozaki family, it's... it's pretty famous in this area...?"

<Ooishi>
"Yes.
 It's crazy.
 Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"
All of a sudden, a cigarette-smoking, overweight old man interrupted our conversation.
...Wait... I know this guy......

<Ooishi>
"Hello!
 Good afternoon.
 Are you on a date today?
 Ah, what I would give to be young again."

<Shion>
"If you thought we were on a date, then why are you bothering us...
 Ooishi-san?"
That was it.
 He was Ooishi-san, a police officer.
...I thought it was this person who came to my rescue when I got involved with those delinquents before.
 ......Now that I thought about it, Mion didn't seem to like him very much.

<Ooishi>
"No, no, I apologize.
 I heard a familiar voice, so I came over to see."
Ooishi-san laughed coarsely, not showing any sign of giving up.
...As Shion watched him do so, I didn't feel the same sense of malice from her as I had from Mion.

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san, right?
 You're one tough guy.
 Two-timing the Sonozaki sisters, are you?"

<Keiichi>
"No, I... I'm not two-timing anyone..."
I turned around to look at Shion and plead for help, but she grinned and maintained her silence.
Her gaze wandered.
 ...She looked at the clock.

<Shion>
"Ah, I'm sorry, Kei-chan.
 ...I really need to get to my job."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 Oh... did you?"
Wait... Didn't Shion have something to talk about today...?
...Now this weird man is here, though...

<Shion>
"Yep. I'll see you later...
 Oh, I'll give you a call after I'm done.
 It'll be okay to call at night, right?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.
 Probably okay."

<Shion>
"Then I'll talk to you later tonight.
 Bye!"
Shion left so fast she was practically running.
...Ooishi-san was waving at me with a grin.
......I felt like I'd been left here as bait so she could get away.
 ...Maybe she was lying about having to go to work...

<Ooishi>
"...You're quite the big shot, being so close to the Sonozaki daughters.
 Maybe I should rethink how I talk to you, too. Nfu-fu-fu!"
Ooishi-san put a coin into a vending machine as he said something a bit appalling.

<Ooishi>
"Is iced tea okay with you?
 Do you want milk in it?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh?!
 Oh... no, I—"

<Ooishi>
"I'll put some in then, all right?
 Here you are."
He handed me a cup of tea, filled to the brim with ice, as I looked on absent-mindedly.
...I don't think I'm obligated to have a guy like this buy me a drink, but...
 He did get it for me, so I'll thank him.
Was Ooishi-san just killing time? We didn't know each other well, but he still engaged me in conversation about all sorts of dumb things.
...When I thought back to how I talked with Shion, this seemed like a total disaster...

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san, how much do you know about Sonozaki-san?"

<Keiichi>
"...Other than what I heard just now, nothing."
Until then, I hadn't known anything about either Mion or Shion other than the fact that they were interesting.
 I really did only just learn that she was the daughter of some prestigious family.

<Ooishi>
"The Sonozakis are a syndicate with this entire region under their thumb.
 Incidentally, her father is a high-ranked executive in a syndicate association that's well known even in the Kanto region. 

<Ooishi>
Did you know that?"

<Keiichi>
"What...?
 An executive...?"

<Ooishi>
"Have you ever seen where Shion-san lives?

<Ooishi>
It's the very picture of a gang boss's house, protected by high walls, barbed-wire fence, and security cameras.
 If you have the chance, you should go and visit her."

<Keiichi>
"............"
She'd mentioned Mion being a successor...... but... to a crime syndicate...?

<Ooishi>
"No, no, no, no, no.
 Not at all, not at all.
 A boring old syndicate isn't the only thing Mion Sonozaki-san will inherit.
 She's inheriting the Sonozaki family itself. 

<Ooishi>
...I'll leave it to you to mull over what exactly that means."
Ooishi-san had spoken lightly about all this from start to finish, but what he was saying wasn't light in the least... it was abrupt and unbelievable.

<Ooishi>
"If Mion-san wanted to, she could kill someone in the middle of the street and still cover it up.
 Not only would witnesses not show up, but she'd put pressure on the police, too."

<Keiichi>
"M-Mion would never kill someone...!"

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha... She wouldn't, she wouldn't. I'm just speaking hypothetically."

<Keiichi>
"...Umm... Your name, it was...
 Ooishi-san, right?"

<Ooishi>
"Yes, that's right."

<Keiichi>
"Then, Ooishi-san.
 ...Whatever family Mion comes from, it doesn't change the fact that she's the best friend I could ever have, and I'm proud of that.
 I don't appreciate people speaking ill of her."
I let my quiet anger show through in my gaze as I stared at him.
...Of course, I could never seem to tell what he's thinking, so I didn't know if it had any effect.

<Ooishi>
"Then let me be frank.
 ...If Mion-san was suspected of a handful of incidents, what would you think?"
Suspected? Incidents?!
You can't just say terrible stuff like that on a whim!

<Keiichi>
"Then it would be a misunderstanding, of course!
 Mion may say some dangerous things... but she's not the kind of person who would do something so awful!!"

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san, keep your voice down...
 We're in a library."
Ooshi-san shushed me, but in a state of heightened excitement as I was, I wouldn't be calmed so easily.

<Ooishi>
"...Please, calm down.
 As I said before, the Sonozaki family holds a lot of power in this region, for better or worse.
 So if anything happens, they would immediately be suspect. 

<Ooishi>
...I'd appreciate it if you understood that."
...Well... I know what Ooishi-san is trying to say.
Combining it with what Shion told me before, the Sonozaki family is huge, and controls everything from Hinamizawa to Okinomiya.
Mion, meanwhile, is its successor, who apparently holds strong influence over the entire family.
Still... that's all? That's the only reason they're suspecting her?!

<Ooishi>
"I'm just doing my job, here.
 Not to doubt Mion-san of anything, but to clear up suspicions surrounding her... Please think of it like that."
...He could talk a dog out of a meat truck.
He was the definition of a shrewd, unfair adult.
At this point, I began to think...
 ...that it was no coincidence I'd met him.


<Keiichi>
"...Ooishi-san, do you need something from me?"

<Ooishi>
"Yes, I do.
 Keiichi Maebara-san."
...he answered in an absent tone of voice.

<Keiichi>
"...Mion's being suspected of something, and you came to hear from a friend of hers: me.
 ...Is that it?"

<Ooishi>
"No, no, that isn't it.
 I didn't come to talk to a friend of Mion Sonozaki-san. I came here to talk to Keiichi Maebara-san.
 It would probably have bothered you had I visited your house."

<Keiichi>
"To me...?
 What do the police want with me...?"
Having realized this faked coincidental meeting had me as its target, my mood immediately turned foul.

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha.
 You don't need to be so tense.
 Calm down, and just answer a few questions."

<Keiichi>
"Am I... being questioned...?"

<Ooishi>
"Let's call it a chat with a guy you happened to run into. Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"
Ooishi-san freely suggested that I relax.
...That said, behind his eyes was a light, which I could only see sometimes, that was sharp as a hawk.
If I tried in vain to run away, he might actually take me in and bring me to an interrogation room or something.
 ...That was an undoubtedly unpleasant thought.

<Ooishi>
"...You had a roaring good time at the Watanagashi Festival last night, didn't you?"

<Keiichi>
"Don't beat around the bush, please...!
 I can't do small talk right now..."

<Ooishi>
"Last night, during the festival.
 ...Did you see Jirou Tomitake-san and Miyo Takano-san?"
......Gulp.
I could plainly feel myself give a start.

<Ooishi>
"Hmm? ...Where did I put those pictures?
 ...Oh.
 Here they are."
He opened a small notebook and removed two photographs.
 ...I didn't have to look.

<Keiichi>
"I... Well...
 Who knows?
 I might have seen them around, I don't remember..."
I was asked the same question for the second time today.
 ...I gave the same answer for the second time, too.

<Ooishi>
"Hm? Your memories are blurry?
 You couldn't have possibly been drinking or anything? Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"
Here, too... I got the same answer as I had from Mion.
...I realized he wasn't taking my vague reply well...
Why... is he asking me... the same thing Mion did...?
The dark feelings I had nearly forgotten due to my conversation with Shion came rushing back in a hurry.
......We snuck into the sacred ritual storehouse—a punishable act.
...It was on a tiny impulse...
 While it may not count for much now... I do feel sorry about it...

<Ooishi>
"I'll ask you again.
 ...Did you see Jirou Tomitake-san and Miyo Takano-san at the festival last night?"
His tone was soft... but there was a dreadfulness in his voice, clearly different from the first time he asked.
 ......I'm scared.
 That was exactly how I felt...

<Keiichi>
"...Er...
 Even if you repeat the question...
 m-my answer won't change..."
I don't really remember.
...There wasn't any better answer I could give him.
I didn't have the balls to say I didn't see them... nor the courage to admit I had.

<Ooishi>
"I see.
 ...I just thought that maybe I'd get a different answer if I asked a second time."
I'm too scared... to look Ooishi-san in the eyes.

<Ooishi>
"I'll change the question.
 ...Come, Maebara-san.
 Relax, relax."
Ooishi-san grabbed my shoulders and squeezed them, as if trying to give me a massage.
 ...It mostly just hurt, though.
Still...... why... would he ask the same things as Mion?
...If he's asking the same things, then the next question must be...

<Ooishi>
"On the same night of the festival,
 did you see Shion Sonozaki-san?"
......*clatter* *clatter* *clatter*
...I wondered what that sound was, and when I looked down, I saw that it was the unmelted ice in the cup I was gripping in my hands.
...My hands were trembling, rocking the ice back and forth.
...Realizing that, I hastily put the remaining ice in my mouth and crunched down on it.

<Keiichi>
"...S... Sorry...
 I may have seen her... but... well, you know, she looks just like Mion...
 ...I might have just mistaken the two..."

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha.
 ...But that can't be."
Suddenly, Ooishi-san grabbed both my shoulders and hunched down to give me a level stare.
...This must be what it's like... to be a deer in the headlights.
I want to look away... but I can't...
This is the first time I've experienced... such a piercing stare...

<Ooishi>
"Mion-san and Shion-san wear completely different clothing.
 You wouldn't mistake the two so easily, I would think.
 Maebara-san."
His voice was harsh.
 ...Harsh, the same as when Mion said it.
I could feel my heartbeat quickening.
...When I realized he could feel it through the hands on my shoulders, I got even more scared.
...Why... why are Mion and Ooishi-san... both asking about last night...?
Was sneaking into that storehouse so... bad...... urgh.........
...I shouldn't have let Takano-san talk me into it.
Tomitake-san casually said to check it out, too... so...
...Even Shion... If she hadn't encouraged me...
No... I understood.
I was the one most at fault here.
I shouldn't have let my curiosity get the better of me. I shouldn't have gone into the forbidden storehouse...

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-san.
 I think that's our cue to get out of here."
A young man wearing a suit came into the lounge.
...From the way he held himself, I knew immediately that he was Ooishi-san's subordinate.

<Ooishi>
"Hm? Oh, so it is.
 Closing time already?"
I hadn't realized it until he said something.
...The jingle and announcement telling patrons the library had closed had started playing without me realizing it.
...I was so irritated, so overwhelmed, that I couldn't even hear it.

<Ooishi>
"Well then, Maebara-kun.
 We're out of time, so allow me to take my leave.
 I'd like to talk with you more about this at your leisure, when we have more time."
...This isn't a joke.
 If I never saw him again, it would be too soon...
Ooishi-san followed his subordinate and left the lounge behind him.
 ...However, he spun back around.

<Ooishi>
"Oh, right, Maebara-san."

<Keiichi>
"...Wha...
 ...What is it...?"

<Ooishi>
"Those two questions I asked you before.
 ...You don't remember well enough to answer either of them, correct?"

<Keiichi>
"......Eh... r-right......"

<Ooishi>
"Just so you know...
 ...You saw them all yesterday.
 You were walking along, the four of you, having quite a pleasant time.
 ...Near the stone steps.
 I saw you with my own eyes."

<Keiichi>
"Ugh............"
...I caught my breath, and my heart seemed like it was about to stop.
...What a detestable person.
...He... he knew... and he was testing me...

<Ooishi>
"We'll meet again.
 Have a good year."
I sat there like a rock, unmoving... until I could no longer hear the clacking sounds of their footsteps...



[Watanagashi Ch.10]

I was on my way back home.
......The cries of the higurashi accentuated the already-lonely evening.
...More time had passed than I'd thought.
The orange of the dusky sky was being chased down, little by little, by an indigo color approaching from the east.
Exhausted from the slow climb towards Hinamizawa... without even noticing, I'd gotten off my bicycle and was pushing it uphill.

<Keiichi>
"............"
I don't understand any of this...
...No one had told me to my face that I'd done something wrong.
...No... In fact, it might have been much easier on me that way.
What happened yesterday... really was just my curiosity.
...It really was no more than a quiet prank... no more than having the courage to cross at a red light as long as you did it with other people.
The storehouse for ritual implements—hallowed ground, only accessible to the family of the priest.
For sure, I'd seen terrifying things that I'd never imagined would be there.
...Thinking on it now, though, it didn't matter what was stored away inside—it didn't make the wrong I had committed any more right.
...What the four of us did... Mion seemed to know about it.
...For some reason, even the police were trying to learn what the four of us did.
Did we do... something so bad......?
Really...
...It doesn't matter how wrong it was.
...I did something wrong.
 It was nothing more than that, and yet...
I couldn't accept it. I didn't apologize to Mion or Ooishi-san—all I did was shield myself with ambiguities...
I did something wrong yesterday.
...I set foot into a forbidden storehouse for a little bit of mischief.
I'll forget everything I saw in there.
I won't ever do something like that again, either.
...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
If I apologize like that... would they forgive me...?
The suddenly cool evening air left no room for such sentiment, however, as it mercilessly chilled my feet, urging me to head home as soon as possible...
...In the end, the evening air was correct.
If I trudged along such an isolated road, regrets would pile on top of regrets, but nothing would change.
Let's go home.
I'll go home, go to my room, put on my favorite music or something, and go to bed.
...That might sound plain and boring, but it's probably the strongest I've felt all day.

<Keiichi>
"............Hoo..."
Now that I've made a decision, there's no point in dawdling in a place like this.
 I sat back on my bike.
I pushed hard on the pedals.
I rapidly advanced forward.
I steadily gained speed.
The wind was cutting and mercilessly cold, but it actually felt good, as if it were softly punishing me...
I didn't eat much dinner before excusing myself early and returning to my bedroom.
My mom called me from downstairs.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi~
 You have a call!
 It's from Sonozaki-san!"
Sonozaki?
 Was it Mion?
...No, it was Shion.
...I just remembered.
She'd had something she wanted to tell me today.
Ooishi-san had interrupted us, so she didn't get the chance.
 ...Shion had said she'd call tonight...

<Keiichi>
"Hello?
 ...Is that you, Shion?"

<Shion>
"Hello.
 Ran into a bit of trouble today, didn't we?"
She said it so plainly that I got a bit annoyed.
 ...She was the one who left me there and ran.

<Shion>
"Don't say that.
 I gave you the signal to run away with me, didn't I?
 You just sat there looking dazed, Kei-chan."

<Keiichi>
"I-I wasn't dazed!
 ...All of a sudden you left me there, and after that, I had to put up with that Ooishi guy for ages!"

<Shion>
"Don't complain to me about it."
...I-I can't believe she passed it off like that!
She looks just like Mion, and yet inside, she's this different?
...I got a little irritated at myself when I realized I was, somewhere in my mind, hoping for the same reaction I would get from Mion, even though she's a different person.

<Keiichi>
"...Uh... sorry.
 Next time I'll run away first thing and leave you there."

<Shion>
"Hey, it's ladies first. Ahahahahaha!"
Shion laughed refreshingly.
...When I heard her voice, I realized that she wasn't really that angry or anything.
...It was just as she said.
...The cause of my temper was because it was my own fault for not leaving immediately.
...I'll stop blaming it on others.
 Blaming it on others would be...

<Keiichi>
"Anyway... You had something to tell me, right?"

<Shion>
"Oh, yeah.
 .........I mean, if you already know, then it's not something that bears repeating.
 ...Umm...
 ...Do you already know?"
Shion lowered her voice suddenly, as if she were glancing around.
...I had no idea what I could already know.

<Keiichi>
"...Sorry, but I have no clue what you're talking about.
 At least give me a hint."

<Shion>
"......So that means...
 ...you don't know."
She seemed to take my stupid-sounding question as evidence.
However, her voice didn't sound disappointed or exasperated in the slightest.

<Shion>
"Actually,
 ...It's about last night, during the Watanagashi Festival."
My entire body jolted as I was assailed by a terrible feeling...
...I-Is Shion... going to ask the same thing...?!

<Shion>
"Hello?
 Kei-chan, are you listening...?"

<Keiichi>
"...Uh... yeah.
 I am.
 ...What about last night?"

<Shion>
"The four of us... went in there, right?"
...She didn't beat around the bush.
Whether or not I wanted to admit it... that was the actual, honest truth, and I couldn't act like it hadn't happened...

<Shion>
"Then, after that, we walked away together... and then went our separate ways near the stone stairs, right?
 Takano-san and Tomitake-san went to the stream, and you stayed there, Kei-chan. 

<Shion>
I went over to see some relatives."

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah.
 Why do you ask?"

<Shion>
"......We won't make any progress if we keep asking each other questions... so let me ask this question first.
 Okay?"

<Keiichi>
"You mean... did I see Tomitake-san and Takano-san last night?"

<Shion>
"......Huh?
 ...Oh, yes.
 ...Did you see the two of them after that?"
...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't surprised.
...This is the third time I've been asked this question today.
Why?
 Why?
 What the hell was going on?!

<Keiichi>
"W-Why?!
 Why are you asking me that?!"

<Shion>
"No, Kei-chan!
 I'm asking the question.
 Please answer me."

<Keiichi>
"D-Did you, Shion?
 If you answer first, then I'll answer...!"
My shabby response betrayed how scared and small I felt now... after everything that had happened today.
Shion didn't say anything for a few moments.
...Just as I was beginning to think I'd really put my foot in my mouth with that response, she finally answered me.

<Shion>
"Of course, I didn't see them.
 My relatives were with me, and they can vouch for that."

<Keiichi>
"...I didn't see them either.
 People can vouch for me, too—like Mion, Rena, and everyone else."
Now that we knew our answers matched, she let out a sigh that sounded more relieved than anything else...

<Shion>
"Thank you for answering me honestly.
 ...Okay, then... I'll tell you.

<Shion>
...Apparently, last night, Takano-san and Tomitake-san died."

<Keiichi>
"......Sorry, Shion.
 ...What was that you just said?"

<Shion>
"Apparently, last night, Takano-san and Tomitake-san died.

 Takano-san was found burned to death.
 Tomitake-san was... well, it looked like a suicide.
 ...I found out this morning. 

<Shion>
...I heard my dad talking to a relative on the phone about it..."
Late last night.
A police car on its way back from festival security duty had discovered Tomitake-san lying in the middle of the road heading towards Okinomiya.
He had... clawed out his throat,
 and died.


<Keiichi>
"W-What? He... clawed out his own throat?
 Th-That bright, cheerful Tomitake-san committed suicide?!
 That can't possibly be right!!"

<Shion>
"The police did an autopsy!
 He did it with his own fingernails!
 He scratched at his throat so hard that he ruptured his blood vessels and bled out!
 He died in a pool of his own blood, that's what they said!!"

<Keiichi>
"I've never heard of such an insane suicide!!
 You can't just... scratch open your own throat like that!!"
I realized I was yelling too loudly, so I lowered the force I was putting into my voice...
I didn't want my parents to hear me, so I switched to the cordless phone and ran up to my own room.

<Keiichi>
"...Sorry for yelling.
 ...So?
 Was Takano-san... was that a suicide too?"

<Shion>
"In her case... it's a little unclear......"
Takano-san's body was found in the mountains of Gifu Prefecture.
Employees at a rest stop nearby reported to the police late that night that they could see flames in the mountains.
The firefighters dispatched there were the first ones to find her.
An autopsy concluded that it was the burned corpse of a half-naked female.
They initially considered the body beyond recognition, but directly after, there was a request for a dental comparison from the ×× prefectural police station in Okinomiya, and the results concluded that it was Miyo Takano.
The cause of death wasn't confirmed, but it was highly likely to have been a homicide, since she was in her undergarments, and her clothes were nowhere in the area.

<Shion>
"...The oil drum had fallen over, so it's also possible she burned herself to death."

<Keiichi>
"I-It couldn't possibly have been suicide!!
 If you're going to die, there are plenty of easier ways, aren't there?!
 This is... this can't be suicide!!"

<Shion>
"That's what I think!
 It's unthinkable that Tomitake-san would kill himself, too!"
After the two us rattled on at each other, there was a silence as we paused to catch our breaths.
...And as we calmed our nerves...
 right then, I understood what Shion's story actually meant...

<Shion>
"...I think it will end up being Oyashiro-sama's curse.
 We all did more than enough to deserve it, after all."

<Keiichi>
"D-Deserve...? Y-You've gotta be kidding!!
 It's not like I...!!"
Shion wanted to see it with me! I just went along with her!!
 ...I tried to say that, but I fell silent.
...Nothing would come of me blaming others.
...It didn't matter how much everyone else encouraged me... I could have put my foot down.
I lost to my own half-assed sense of adventure and agreed to go in with them
......
 Yes, it was my fault, and no one else's...

<Keiichi>
"......Shion.
 ...Last night, when we snuck into the ritual storehouse, did you predict things would turn out this way...?"

<Shion>
"...Of course not.
 I mean, I thought it was pretty risky... but I never even dreamed something like this could happen."
Shion's words were probably her true feelings.
...She knew she could get in trouble if we were caught, but that was the thrill of this little adventure.
 ...It was the same for me.

<Shion>
"Besides that, Kei-chan.
 ...Think about it for a moment.
 ...Didn't Oyashiro-sama's curse turn out a little strange this year?"
...It was already plenty strange, seeing as how Tomitake-san and Takano-san died like that.
Given all that, what could possibly be stranger...?

<Shion>
"I mean that they found two corpses.
 ...Remember what I said?
 Every other year, one person would die, and one person would disappear.
 ...This year is the first time two people have been found dead."

<Keiichi>
"...That may be true... but that's not a huge deal, is it?"

<Shion>
"It is, Kei-chan.
 ...Think about it harder.
 Listen.
 If two people died because of Oyashiro-sama's curse,
 then in order to quell Oyashiro-sama's anger, two people would need to be sacrificed."

<Keiichi>
"...Is that how it works...?
 So what?
 Tomitake-san and Takano-san died, so now two people are going to go missing this year...?"
...I don't understand why, but...
...When I said that, I felt my spine freeze.

<Shion>
"...I don't think anyone's been confirmed missing yet.
 ...I think that those two people,
 ...have yet to disappear..."
Shion, like me...was obviously getting the same feeling crawling down her back.

<Keiichi>
"Two people... have yet to
 disappear......?"
Shion didn't answer.
I couldn't say any more than that, either.
...A chill crept in through my clothes and tried to wrap into a fist around my heart... cold hands, feeling about on my chest...

<Keiichi>
"............"
Neither of us could say anything.
Tomitake-san opened the lock, and he died. Takano-san exposed the ritual storehouse, and she died.
...If two more people were to be sacrificed...
Then... they would be... none other than the ones who entered with them... none other than us...

<Keiichi>
".........No.
 ...This has... got to be a joke."
I wanted so much for her to pass this off as a joke, even now.
 ...That, though, was such an incredibly difficult and selfish request.
If Tomitake-san and Takano-san had died in a common way like a car accident, I could tell myself it was coincidence.
...Instead... he clawed out his own throat... and she burned to death, drowned in oil, in the mountains... 
...The two deaths were so out-of-the-ordinary... that I couldn't possibly dismiss it as mere coincidence.
It was as if... in exchange for sneaking into the ritual storehouse,
 there must be someone punishing us... some sort of cruel will working behind the scenes.
...Even so... I still didn't want to accept that terrifying truth.
...If I did, then I would have to acknowledge that a horrible crisis was growing near for Shion and I...
...That's why I argued against it.
 ...I argued, knowing I was running away.

<Keiichi>
"I... In the first place... it's not even in the newspaper, is it?!
 Such a monstrous incident would be all over the newspapers and television!! 

<Keiichi>
Magazine writers would flood the village, too, thinking it'd make for an interesting story...!!"

<Shion>
"Of course it's not getting reported by the media.
 ...That's how it was in the past, too."
When the incidents occurred for the third year in a row, there were some third-rate magazines that sniffed out the story and ran issues full of gossip columns about Hinamizawa.
Fearing that the region would develop a negative stigma, they negotiated with the prefecture and the police.
...Since last year, it became a big conspiracy, where no information about the incidents was allowed to be leaked to the media...

<Shion>
"I hear the elders and the top brass from the Sonozaki family put all the pressure they could on the police."

<Keiichi>
"Then you mean... their deaths... are going to be dealt with in total secrecy?!"

<Shion>
"That's how it is.
 ...Of course, the police are investigating it.
 That's being performed in secret too, though, so I hear the investigation itself is very restricted in what it can and can't do. 

<Shion>
You could essentially say they're interfering with a police investigation."
...This story was unbelievable.
...People died... and yet they don't publicize it and deal with everything in secret...

<Shion>
"If we break it down further...
 it means that no matter who dies on the night of Watanagashi, it won't go public."

<Keiichi>
"...Th-That's the biggest pile of bullshit I've ever heard...!"

<Shion>
"Kei-chan.
 ...Before, I said how the villagers could be the ones carrying out Oyashiro-sama's curse.
 ...That's what I mean. 

<Shion>
...At some point, a tradition was created here in Hinamizawa...
 where every year, you're allowed to kill someone on the night of Watanagashi under the guise of it being Oyashiro-sama's curse."
When someone dies on the night of Watanagashi... it turns into the curse of Oyashiro-sama.
The curse turns into the serial murder incidents.
...In order to avoid exacerbating the negative stigma surrounding Hinamizawa... those incidents are dealt with in secret...

<Keiichi>
"That's insane!!
 Dead and missing people turn up every year!!
 However bad the stigma gets, the police have to draw the line somewhere, don't they?!"

<Shion>
"...You could say the incidents happening every year is mysterious, but the police can get the job done when they need to.

<Shion>
After all, the incidents always get resolved individually.
 ...It doesn't end up being a 'string of incidents,' you know?
 It just so happens that something unfortunate happens on the night of Watanagashi every year. 

<Shion>
...That's all it turns into."
Most of the criminals responsible for the original dismemberment were arrested.
The last one managed to get and stay away... but the events were totally exposed and elucidated, so it was, in essence, resolved.
The dam-supporting couple who died in an accident on the second year—that was an accidental death, plain and simple.
...They made a lot of investigations into the possibility of it having been a homicide, but they didn't turn up anything.
 It ended up as an accident.
 It was resolved.
On the third year, the priest fell ill and passed away.
There were doctors present at the hospital at his deathbed, and they all had trustworthy medical certificates.
They even did an autopsy.
It concluded that it wasn't a homicide.
 ...That was resolved, too.
On the fourth year, the sister-in-law of the dam-supporting couple was murdered.
The criminal was an abnormal man with a history of regular psychostimulant usage.
He confessed that he thought Oyashiro-sama's curse was so interesting he wanted to try it out.
The criminal died of an accident while imprisoned, so this incident was essentially resolved as well.
...That's right.
None of the incidents had any relation to another, and each was independently resolved...

<Shion>
"So then why does an unfortunate coincidence occur every year on the night of Watanagashi?
 ...You can try and say it's a string of related incidents, but they're not related. 

<Shion>
...Yet, every year, someone always dies, and someone always disappears!"

The story Takano-san told me on the day before during the setup... now that the curse really had occurred this year, I couldn't just laugh it off.

<Keiichi>
"......Then... ...does that mean... ...it'll come for us too...? 

<Keiichi>
Just like how one person dies and one disappears every year... are you saying we'll be... taken along with Tomitake-san and Takano-san and erased too...?!"
...My lips had, at some point, become completely dry... and just saying that was... difficult.
Shion didn't respond.
...Her silence, however, was the clearest form of confirmation she could give me.

<Keiichi>
"...We... I mean, sure, we went somewhere we shouldn't have...
 ...but we were just looking, right?
 We didn't steal anything or take anything out... and we didn't tell anyone that we looked, right...?"
I was already regretting having committed such a wrong...
Even so... was it really so bad... that Tomitake-san and Takano-san deserved such cruel deaths?!

<Keiichi>
"...Besides, I didn't care about anything I saw in there at all!

<Keiichi>
Takano-san was the only one getting so happy over it, wasn't she?!
 Takano-san was the only one at fault!!
 I don't have anything to do with this!! 

<Keiichi>
I'm not interested, I'm not involved, I don't give a shit about what was in there!!!"
I knew saying so wouldn't solve anything.
I could feel myself, my cold self in the innermost depths of my heart, disgusted at my pointless howling.
 ...However... my emotions had broken through the dam, and I couldn't stop them anymore.

<Keiichi>
"I didn't have any interest in any of this from the start, damn it!!!
 All I wanted to do was watch Rika-chan's performance!!
 You were the one who pulled me away from that, weren't you, Shion?!?! 

<Keiichi>
I don't give a rat's ass whether those two were trying to steal something or try to meet up secretly or whatever!!!
 That's right! You're the one who made me go in there in the first place, Shion!!

<Keiichi>
You were all, 'Kei-chan, you need to see what's inside,' and you convinced me and then pulled me in!!!
 Why the hell did you do that?!?!
 I didn't have anything to do with this!!!
 What will you do? 

<Keiichi>
What are you going to do, damn it?!
 How are you going to take responsibility for this?!?!
 Huh?!
 Hey, are you listeni......... agh!"
Click.
Without any warning, the phone cut off with the soft sound of a receiver being slammed down.
...Shion was just as terrified as I was...... I just said some really self-centered things...
My riled-up emotions disappeared as if they'd never existed, and in their place surged waves of deep regret at having run my mouth so irresponsibly.
I could try to call out Shion's name from beyond the disconnected phone... but it was too late.
.........What have I...
 ......done?
...Shion was only trying to tell me as much as she could about this 'thing' about to descend upon us...
...As for me, I... could only whine like a child about it...
I went to call her back, but then remembered she lived in Okinomiya.
...I didn't know her phone number.
.........Since I had declared to Mion that I hadn't seen Shion last night, I couldn't just call Mion and ask her for Shion's phone number... I was too scared.
...I couldn't even call her back...!
I was stricken with hopeless regret...
......I returned the receiver to its stand, and I simply prayed... that Shion would call me back again.
Please, Shion......
......Calm down... and call me again......!
Ring ring ring ring ring...

<Keiichi>
"H-Hello, this is Maebara!!"
I swept up the receiver as though it wouldn't go through if I didn't grab it at that exact moment.

<Keiichi>
"No, it isn't.
 ...If you need Dad, I'll go call him."
I went to put the receiver back down, but the caller stopped me hurriedly.

<Keiichi>
"...No, nobody's here at the moment."
Clack.
...I don't know who that was, but what if Shion tried to call while I was on the phone?! ...I thought, bubbling with egotistic anger.
Hey, wait......
 Give it a break, Keiichi Maebara.
...These are the selfish emotions that made Shion mad at me, aren't they...?
...The more I thought about it,  though, the more I thought that Shion...
 ...had given up hope in the short time since we had our conversation, and didn't want to call anymore...
Calm yourself, Keiichi Maebara...
...If Shion does call again, then first, apologize in a calm voice...
...If you do that, then Shion should understand...
............
However... no matter how long I waited...
...The phone didn't ring again that night...



[Watanagashi Ch.11]

...There was no way I'd be able to sleep.
When she hung up the phone like that, I realized for the first time what kind of situation I was in, as well as who the only ally who would support me was.
I waited with bated breath for Shion to calm down and call me back.
What would I do if the phone rang while I was sound asleep...?
No matter how long I waited, however, it never rang.
......Exhausted, whenever my mind started to wander, I would jolt awake as though I heard the phone ring.
In the end, I brought the cordless phone with me into my futon and went to sleep with it in my arms.
...Though it still didn't amount to anything...
Morning came, and by that time, I was pretty sure she wasn't calling back.
...That was when a fierce drowsiness assailed me.

<Keiichi>
"Damn it...!
 This is no time for sleep, Keiichi Maebara!"
I slapped myself in the face a few times.
Then, I went to the washroom and washed my face, which was something I usually didn't do.
...That wasn't enough, either, so I even brushed my teeth.
After that, I was finally wide awake.
When Mom saw how strange I was acting, her eyes went wide...

<Keiichi's mom>
"What's wrong, Keiichi?
 Are you going somewhere today?"

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah.
 ...To school."

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, you don't look so good today.
 ...Do you have a cold?"

<Keiichi>
"...I'm not sick, I just didn't get much sleep.
 If I space out and start talking nonsense, just humor me..."

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha!
 I wonder what kind of nonsense you'll say! I wonder!
 ...Now I'm looking forward to it. Hau."
I felt utterly shattered, and I still hadn't picked myself back up this morning—and for precisely that reason, Rena's honest smile was a sight for sore eyes.

<Mion>
"Yo.
 ...What's up, Kei-chan? Rena?
 Good morning."

<Rena>
"Whaaat?
 Mii-chan, you look like you didn't get much sleep either! Either!"

<Keiichi>
...Mion had gone home early yesterday with sleep deprivation, but she didn't look too good this morning, either.
Her usual cheerfulness was completely buried in shadow.

<Mion>
"...Yeah.
 I went to bed at like, three.
 ...I'm a little tired."

<Keiichi>
"Th-Three?! Right after yesterday?!
 Hey, now... You can't keep staying up late!
 You probably read the first volume of a manga, thought it was interesting, then read the entire series, didn't you? 

<Keiichi>
I understand, I've done that before."
I joked, trying to shake off my sleepiness. I was trying to be considerate.
...However, neither Mion nor Rena smiled—in fact, they didn't even pay attention.
Rena's expression immediately darkened.

<Rena>
"............What?
 ...Wait... is it about the mayor?
 He still hasn't been found?"

<Mion>
"......Nope."

<Keiichi>
"Hey, wait a minute.
 What are you talking about? You can't find the mayor?"
Even the classroom, which was normally bursting with bright, joking voices seemed filled with a different sort of murmur today.

<Satoko>
"Good morning, Keiichi-san.
 ...Have you heard?
 It looks like something terrible has happened."

<Keiichi>
"...I don't really know this mayor person... but he's an old guy, right?
 Couldn't he just be wandering around, senile?"

<Satoko>
"The mayor is certainly not senile.
 He's a sprightly man who can teach both calligraphy and swordsmanship."

<Rika>
"......He probably got lost somewhere, like me."

<Rena>
"...A-A lost Rika!☆
 Hau~~~! I wanna take you home with me~~!!"
...Getting lost is only 'kyute' because children like Rika-chan do it.
 ...A worn-out old man getting lost isn't moe in the slightest!
...While my mind entertained dumb thoughts like that, our teacher arrived.
Everyone rushed to their seats.

<Chie>
"Good morning,
 everyone."
Good morning!
The class greeting was normal, but...
 ...the atmosphere in the room was heavy.

<Chie>
"Some of you may have already heard...
 but last night, despite the late hour, the mayor never came home.
 Is there anyone here who saw the mayor yesterday?"
...One or two hands went up in the silence, and they told her about having seen him.
...None of it seemed to be vital information, however, and everyone began whispering amongst themselves...

<Chie>
"If anyone has seen the mayor, please tell an adult about it, all right?
 ...Now then, let's begin class."
After that, the same old lessons began.
The rumors, once quieted, blossomed in flowers again at lunchtime.
...I could hear a few different conversations.
They were mostly related to the mayor's disappearance.
...Summing them all up, I came out with this.
Yesterday evening, the mayor went to a meeting at the shrine's assembly hall.
The meeting ended after the sun had fully set, and everyone left.
The elder's house was a bit far from the center of Hinamizawa.
...It was already late, and Hinamizawa doesn't have a lot of lights outside.
 ...Nobody saw the mayor after the meeting.
However, because he would have been hungry, he wouldn't have taken any side trips—he would have gone straight home.
...However, no matter how long his family waited...
 ...he never returned.
Some thought there might have been an accident.
...They left no stone unturned—they searched from the irrigation channels to the water wells, and even in the rice paddies, but they didn't find him.
Of course... there was a limit to how far they could search in the middle of the night.
The police were going to wait for daylight, then have the young men of the town help search.
 If after all that they still didn't find him, they were apparently even going to go looking in the mountains.
Even now, at this moment, the adults were probably all searching for him...
...The more they searched in vain...
...and the more time passed...
...the only thing that came to mind was...
 ...the curse.
 The rumors of Onikakushi—of the 'demoning away.'
...Had he become this year's sacrifice to Oyashiro-sama's curse, which had recently been occurring every year...?
That scary possibility, which everybody thought about but nobody could say aloud, was slowly but surely spreading throughout the village...
Was he demoned away... and offered as a sacrifice to quell Oyashiro-sama's anger...?
My classmates were whispering to each other that the curse didn't happen this year, so there shouldn't have been any sacrifices.
...I, on the other hand... I knew.
The curse did happen again this year, and there were two people that died.
...This may sound strange, but... I hadn't exactly thought the elder would be the one to go missing.
My reason was clear.
...Shion and I should have been a higher priority than him.
The four of us were thieves that broke the taboo and set foot into the sacred ritual storehouse.
If Tomitake-san and Takano-san had suffered mysterious deaths... then it should have been my and Shion's turn next......

<Keiichi>
"...This time should have been Shion and me... eh?"
...I laughed painfully to myself.
I'd yelled at Shion over the phone that I didn't want to end up in such a terrifying situation, but...
 now that someone other than me had disappeared, I could only think that I should have been the first to go.
......Onigafuchi, the bottomless swamp said to have been the place where they drowned sacrifices long ago.
...Just as it ran through my thoughts, the villagers must have also considered the swamp.
Maybe police divers were plumbing its depths even now...
...They probably wouldn't find anyone.
...Not a single missing person had ever been found.
They'd always suspected Onigafuchi, but not once have they ever turned up a corpse from it.
...After all, it was a devilish, bottomless swamp from which no one who sinks can ever return...
...I could hear someone telling their friend that in the classroom...

<Young boy>
"...Now that you mention it, Satoshi-san... he left around this time last year, didn't he?"

Huh?
 Satoshi?
......I've heard that name before.
 ...He was... right, he disappeared because of last year's curse.
The conversation was happening in the seat next to me, so I could hear it clearly.

<Young boy>
"...Didn't we search the whole village like this for Satoshi-san, too?"

<Young boy>
"We didn't find him, either.
 ...Hmm... What did we decide that was?
 ...A demoning away, right?"

<Young boy>
"Yeah.
 I heard he withdrew all his savings and ran away from home.
 Someone from the police said there was someone who saw him get on the bullet train at Nagoya Station!"
.........Ran away, huh?
I wasn't that interested in the reason, which seemed understandable in this case.
Everyone else who disappeared had their own reasons too.
Either they were still on the run because they were criminals, or they were a corpse that couldn't be found.
...It's not like any of them suddenly disappeared into thin air for no reason.
But,
 they disappeared.
...Someone disappeared whenever the curse took a life, as if by design.
They may have had various understandable reasons, but they still disappeared.
.........From that point of view, it really might have been a demoning away this time.
The mayor's disappearance was the first such incident without a clear reason behind it.
...Of course, coming to that realization didn't help to resolve anything...

<Rena>
"...It looks like I messed up the seasoning today.
 Ehehe... Sorry."
Normally, Rena's lunch would have been devoured immediately, but today there was still a ton left.
...That wasn't because Rena's lunch didn't taste good or anything, though...

<Satoko>
"Th-That isn't the case.
 Your lunch today is as delicious as always!"
Satoko dips her chopsticks into Rena's bento box and pulls bits of food out one after the other.

<Satoko>
"Yes, delicious indeed!
 Today in particular, in fact!
 Chomp chomp!!"

<Rena>
"Ahahaha... Huh? You know those are pumpkin croquettes, right?
 Are you okay?"

<Satoko>
"......Nggh...... ...Y-Yes!
 If it's your pumpkin, then it's delicious!"
...Did Satoko dislike pumpkin?
Regardless, she forced herself to smile and shoved more into her mouth.
...Everyone knew.
Nobody's lunch tasted very good today.
Satoko kept shoveling it down, repeating her remark on how good it was.

<Keiichi>
"...If it's that good, then I guess I've gotta have some, too. Satoko's gonna eat it all if we let her."

<Satoko>
"I-It's just so good, so I would certainly like it if Keiichi-san were to eat some as well...!"

<Keiichi>
"Well, sometimes I have to show my adult generosity, right?
 Okay, don't hold back on my account!
 Eat enough for the both of us today!"

<Satoko>
"Fu... fuwaaaaahhhh...!!"
...She really, really hated pumpkin, didn't she?
That made it all the more touching to see Satoko's own brand of generosity.
...I grabbed her head and started stroking it.
...Satoko, in a somewhat exaggerated fashion, was bawling, tears streaming down her face.

<Keiichi>
"No way.
 ...You'll never grow up if you give away such good food.
 Rena, you eat too.
 I only have leftover vegetable stew, but it tastes great after having sat overnight."

<Rena>
"...Yeah!
 The daikon radish has such a pretty color going through it. It looks delicious.
 I guess I'll have some, then~"
Rena reached out with her chopsticks, ...and at last, the usual lunchtime atmosphere began to return.
That was only at our desks, however.
...The dark tales of Oyashiro-sama's curse, which had recurred for five years in a row, didn't cease.
 The whole classroom remained stuck in this somber mood...
...Oyashiro-sama's curse had happened for five years straight.
Everyone had wanted the previous year to be the last.
...What was Oyashiro-sama's curse, anyway?
They were going to build a dam in Hinamizawa.
The people building it were bad.
So they were cursed.
...I would admit that much.
...Still, the dam project was frozen years ago, wasn't it?
 So why was the curse stubbornly persisting...?
I hit myself on the cheeks to perk myself back up.
Everyone was trying so hard to brighten the mood—I couldn't go straight back to thinking about the curse like that...!
I forced the grim story out of my head.
...Driving Oyashiro-sama's curse out of my thoughts was actually a good idea.
...In the end, that meant I would also be driving away the most terrifying thought of all—that I could be the curse's next target...

<Keiichi>
"...Mion's taking a while, isn't she?
 How long does it take to wash your hands?"
Mion had said she was going to wash her hands and left, and she hadn't come back yet.

<Rena>
"...Ahahaha.
 She's probably taking a little afternoon nap somewhere.
 ...I think she was up pretty late last night looking for the mayor, after all."
...I smiled wryly and let out a sigh.
...Today was no good.
However much we tried to lighten the mood, things always came back to the mayor.
 ...It was just a no-good day.
...I had just transferred here recently, so the shock of a curse happening five years running was... an unimaginably big one.
......Maybe I do need to appreciate that.

<Rena>
"...When Mii-chan was really little, the mayor would always spoil her.
 When she was going through her prankster phase... he loved her like his own daughter.
 ...She's told me that often."
......I see.
 ...Mion was in shock, too.
Someone disappearing at all because of a curse was a very scary thing.
...If the sacrifice was someone you knew, though... then the shock must be a hundred times worse.
Satoko, as if she'd come to the same conclusion, bit her lower lip and looked downward...

<Keiichi>
"Oh, Rika-chan is taking a while, too.
 Maybe they're taking a nice afternoon nap together?"

<Satoko>
"...Rika wasn't out that late.
 ...As soon as she yawned, everyone gathered around her and started saying 'good night, good night!'"
Now that she mentioned it, there were a lot of old people rubbing their prayer beads in fervent gratitude towards Rika-chan during the festival, too...
An image of the indulgent elderly came to mind.
...Had Rika-chan discovered a way to get herself to be pampered like that...???

<Keiichi>
"...Is there a reason the old people treat Rika-chan like an idol?
 Is she their ideal image of a granddaughter or something?"

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha!
 I don't know anything about that~!
 But, b-b-b-but, I want to see Rika-chan yawning~~~!!
 ...It's probably all like, fwaahh~...
 ...Hau~~~!! I wanna take her home~~~!!!"

<Satoko>
"......I don't personally think it's that cute.
 ...It's more of a 'gwahh,' and she opens her mouth really wide so you can see the back of her throat...?"

<Rena>
"R-R-R-R-Rika-chan's giant yawn~~~! Hau~~~~!!!!"
Rena's handy at times like these...
 I finally managed a heartfelt laugh.
...Oh, right.
I'm on day duty today, aren't I?
 I need to go water the flower garden.
The garden is right outside the teacher's lounge, too, so they can immediately tell if you don't do it right.

<Rena>
"I-I-I-I think Satoko-chan is kyute, not only R-Rika-chan~!!
 Giaaant~~yaaaawn~~!!!"

<Satoko>
"Gh-Gh-Gh, gheehehhhh~~~...!!
 Can't... breathe......"

<Rena>
"H-Hau~~!!
 I got a glimpse! It was so kyute!!
 Satoko-chan's is kyute too! I'm gonna take you home~~!!!!"
...Rena was strangling Satoko. I don't think that counts as yawning...
...You know, Rena is...
 ......
 I can't say it out loud... but she's a notorious... [censored], isn't she... (sweat)
Hearing Satoko make a weird noise like a chicken being strangled was kind of hilarious, and I couldn't help but laugh.
At some point, the classroom had erupted into laughter too.
...Maybe Rena was doing it on purpose.
Even if she wasn't, this nonsense was a welcome sight.
Anyway.
...Let's get over to the flowers while I still have time.
Slowly and quietly, lest I destroy the room's newfound peace, I left the classroom.
The watering can was hanging up outside the kitchen.
This building had originally been an all-male forestry service building, so there was apparently nothing so thoughtful as a garden here before.
When they decided to have a school share the space, they built one there as a modest gesture of appreciation.
But, well, the flower bed... it was a little... longer than you'd expect.
It went all around.
It went all over the place.
It was so big one would need to refill the watering can five or six times to get it all done.
I was doing this together with a kid who was also, thankfully, on day duty today...
 She was in the lowest grade, though, and a full size smaller than even Rika-chan.
I couldn't make a kid who would struggle just to lift the full watering can help me with this...
......If you were placed on day duty with someone who liked this sort of thing, they'd do it all for you, so it'd be cake.

<Keiichi>
"No point in blaming her.
 ...I give up. I'll just get started."
Watering can in hand, just as I was about to leave the building, the old man from the forestry office addressed me.

<Man>
"Sonny, there's a vegetable garden behind the warehouse, right?
 It's all just about dried up.
 Water that too, would you?"

<Keiichi>
"Oh, you mean that curry vegetable garden?
 The one with the potatoes and carrots, and other things that are only ingredients for curry?"
It's definitely the personal garden of our curry-loving teacher, but...
Making students responsible for its upkeep is getting them involved in her personal affairs.
I couldn't say that to his face, though, so I gave up and decided to carry out my day duties.
The sunlight out front was strong.
...The great chorus of cicadas was strongly underlining how nothing was different today than yesterday.
I passed by the classroom... and I don't know how it happened, but Rena and Satoko were in the middle of a huge melee.
While I was gone, the kids had arranged all the desks in a circle, forming a ring, while everyone was cheering them on.
......Yeah. That's how it should be.
Once school ended, we would need to return to reality, where talk of the elder's disappearance would once again be all over the place.
I wanted everyone to forget about everything and have fun, just like yesterday, if only while they were at school.
In that sense, Satoko's whirling elbow and Rena's backwards flying spin-kick made for a pleasant sight.
...Even if, as a result, they flipped over my desk...
 Agh, that's my pencil box!!
 ...Guh...... I'll just let it happen today.
I set to work, hastily watering everything, wanting nothing more than to be done as soon as possible.
That should about do it!
 No sooner had I thought that than I remembered that I had to water the teacher's curry vegetable garden too.

<Keiichi>
"...That's such a pain...  but I have a feeling that it'll come back to bite me if I don't."
I gave up, filled the can with water again, and headed behind the warehouse.
This was a place students didn't like to go—it was always damp here, and you couldn't discard the possibility of slugs and pill bugs being around.
So when I ran across her in a place like that, I was surprised.

<Keiichi>
"Whoa!!
 Oh... it's Rika-chan.
 ...Don't scare me like that..."
Rika-chan was just standing there like a puppet... devoid of life...
...I was the only one who was startled here.
Rika-chan didn't even seem to react to my appearance.

<Keiichi>
".........Rika-chan...?"
...Finally, she noticed me.
...Her expression was clearly abnormal.
...There was red under her eyes... stained with tears and dirt.
...There were blades of grass stuck in her hair, too, and her clothes looked as though she'd fallen to the ground.

<Keiichi>
"Rika-chan...?!
 Are you... are you hurt?
 Did you fall...?!"

<Rika>
"......*hic*
 ...N-No.
 ...That isn't it,"
Rika-chan said in the brightest voice she could manage as she rubbed her eyes...
She didn't look anywhere near normal, though.

<Keiichi>
"What happened?
 You weren't sleeping on the storehouse roof... and then fell off or anything, did you...?"

<Rika>
"......Don't worry about me.
 I have something I want to ask you, Keiichi."
...Rika-chan walked over and clung to me.
At first, I thought she was playing a trick on me.
...Eventually, however... I realized it was so that I wouldn't run from the question she was about to ask...
 I shuddered.

<Keiichi>
"What...
 ...what do you want from me?"
She looked straight into my eyes.
Her upturned eyes... bored right into me.
...It was as though they were trying to pull the answer out of my own eyes, without actually asking me the question.
It was scary... so I averted my eyes from hers...

<Rika>
"......Keiichi.
 Did you... do something bad on the night of the festival...?"

My body gave a jolt from its very core.
...Rika-chan, who was clinging to me, might have felt my shiver.
A nervous tingle crawled up from my feet... and after going up my back and freezing my entire body... it made its way into my brain...

<Rika>
"......Keiichi.
 Do you really not remember?"
"............"
My head... began to throb...
 ...I don't... I don't understand anything.
Mion asked me,
Ooishi-san asked me,
Shion asked me,
...and now Rika-chan was asking me...
We thought nobody knew... about what we did last night, but...
 In fact, everyone knew...?!
They all knew... and they came to ask me.
Again, and again... until I admitted it.
...When I thought about it... it was pretty clear the whole thing was out in the open.
...After all... don't Tomitake-san and Takano-san's deaths prove it?

<Rika>
"......Keiichi?"
...I... how should I respond?
We never should have entered the forbidden storehouse... and even though I regretted it so much, was she saying it wasn't enough...?
...However... I had all but decided what I was going to say.

<Keiichi>
"I... I'm not exactly a good kid, you know?
 ...I've done lots of bad things, so I can't remember anything specific."
Just as I had with all the others... I evaded the question.
Rika-chan... stared up at me with innocent eyes.
...Her eyes were so painful that I had to look away.
After a few moments of mutual silence, Rika-chan released me.

<Rika>
"...I'm sorry for asking you something strange.
 Please forget about it..."
she said, smiling her usual smile.
...Then, tap tap tap tap... she went running off, as if nothing had happened.
...As she retreated in silence, I could feel her accusing me...
............
.........

<Keiichi>
"...Ri... Rika-chan...!"
If she didn't hear my voice, then I was going to give up.
...However, she heard it.
...Rika-chan swiveled around and waited for me to continue.
...I was the one who had questions now.
Still... asking any of them could just be... a half-assed way of admitting what I did...

<Keiichi>
"...Hey, Rika-chan."

<Rika>
"......What is it?"
...If everyone knows anyway... then I should be able... to at least ask this, right?
Why is everyone asking me about the night of the festival?
...That evening...
 ...Had I done something... that wrong...?
I felt plenty sorry about it... and I only looked, anyway...
I didn't break anything, or steal anything.
 ...Really!
...Still... Tomitake-san... and Takano-san... they died so miserably.
...Since those two had come to such an end... there's obviously no way 'it' would forgive only me...

<Keiichi>
"............"
Rika-chan cutely tilted her head in confusion... and waited for me to say something.
......If I were to admit to what happened that night, though... she might suddenly do a one-eighty, as if flipping a switch.
...That would make sense.
...Rika-chan... was the shrine maiden...
She was the least likely to forgive me for breaking the taboo, wasn't she?
Upon reflection, wouldn't telling her... be more terrifying than telling Mion or Ooishi-san...?

<Keiichi>
"............"
...Rika-chan could just give up and leave, couldn't she?
...She didn't.
...She only, she only... was quietly, quietly waiting... for me to say it myself.
...Say it, Keiichi Maebara.
...If you really are sorry... then you should say so.
Of course... it's normal to hesitate, given the crazy way Tomitake-san and Takano-san died.
...A pulping machine called 'chaos' was grinding up my brain...
...The juice wrung out of it... turned into big droplets of sweat... which began to fall...

<Rika>
"......Keiichi."
Rika-chan suddenly straightened up... trying to pat me on the head.

<Rika>
"......I don't really understand what you're worried about, Keiichi."
...I had nothing to say to that.
 ...I lowered my head a little so that Rika-chan's palm could reach it.
...She petted me, kind of like one would a cat.

<Rika>
"......Do you know about the big storehouse a little way behind the shrine grounds?
 It stores the implements we use for rituals."
...My breath literally stopped.
...Rika-chan, though, wasn't acting in a coercive way at all.

<Rika>
"......Apparently, on the night of a festival, a cat snuck into the storehouse."

<Keiichi>
"A... cat...?"

<Rika>
"......Yes.
 A cat.
 Meow, meow."
Rika-chan knew.
...She realized I was in fear.
...I could tell she was desperately trying to choose the right words so that she wouldn't scare me.

<Rika>
"...The cat always wanted to explore inside the storehouse, but...
 ...I was mean to it, and never let it go inside.
 ......So, on the night of the festival... 

<Rika>
...the cat couldn't hold itself back any longer, and went inside."
The cat...
...It was clearly supposed to be Takano-san.
...Or, wait... was it... supposed to be me...?

<Rika>
"......Inside... there were actually lots of things that scared the cat."
Rika-chan made a cute gesture like a ghost was coming out to frighten me.

<Rika>
"......The cat was both terrified and amazed.
 ......It ran away as fast as it could, clatter clatter, shiver shiver, meow meow. It was terrible."

<Keiichi>
"Th...... This cat... who are you saying it was?"

<Rika>
"......The cat is a cat.
 Meow, meow."
Rika-chan still avoided saying it.
...The cat, though, was without a doubt... me.

<Keiichi>
"Rika-chan...
 ...Please... tell me.
 The cat... what should it do now?"
...Maybe it was a desperate question to ask.
...I had sort of admitted to being the cat.

<Rika>
"......The cat is just a cat, so it can just keep meowing and everything will be fine."

<Keiichi>
"E-Everything will be fine... that's stupid...!"

<Rika>
"......Shouldn't it just keep meowing?"
Geez... Rika-chan and I have put together an entire conversation... using 'cat' as a codeword.
I didn't say it directly... but...
 I had already admitted it.
I didn't want to end up like those two.
...I didn't want to be... a sacrifice, like Shion said.
......That's what I thought... so I stubbornly remained silent.
 ...But now... that's enough......

<Keiichi>
"...It can't just keep... meowing.
 ...The dog saw the cat... making mischief and sneaking inside."

<Rika>
"......The dog."

<Keiichi>
"...That's right.
 ...It was the dog.
 ...It keeps coming to the cat... and trying to get it to say that it snuck inside."

<Rika>
"............"
After I said that, Rika-chan's expression clouded over.
...She was trying to hide it, but I'd already noticed her eyes darkening.

<Keiichi>
"...Rika-chan......"
The silence was frightening... so I spurred her on.
 ...At that point, Rika-chan grinned.

<Rika>
"......It's all right.
 I'll protect the cat."
...Huh?
...I thought for a moment... that I had misheard those words, so dependable they were.

<Rika>
"......The cat is really scared... but it really isn't all that bad.
 I think all of the dogs are just misunderstanding."

<Keiichi>
"Eh...? It's not all that bad...?"

<Rika>
"......The cat is worrying too much.
 I'll do something about it for sure."
Rika-chan will... do something about it...?
...I don't even know left from right at the moment... so Rika-chan didn't look all that dependable.

<Rika>
"...It might be hard, but I'll do my best.
 Go for it, yay!"
She clenched her fist and stuck it in the air.
...Rika-chan said that the cat can just keep meowing.
...She said to leave it all to her.
...I-Is that... really all it took... to resolve this whole thing...?!

<Keiichi>
"Will you... really be all right... Rika-chan?"

<Rika>
"...If I don't do my best, then something bad could happen to the dogs, too."
.........I had no idea what Rika-chan was talking about anymore.
She had been talking to me under the assumption that I was aware of certain things.
...So at first, I understood her.
...Around the middle, though, I stopped understanding anything.
...However, one thing I did know was......
 to not worry, and to leave it to her...
Rika-chan straightened up once again, patted me on the head, and smiled.
......I was so moved... by that reassuring feeling... that I couldn't help but start to cry...

<Keiichi>
"...I'm so... rry...
 ...The cat... it really was... just a little bit of mischief.
 ...It didn't think... any of this would......"

<Rika>
"......It's too much of a scaredy-cat.
 ...That's why it should never have seen the storehouse."
...She was right.
...It was far too shocking for someone to see based on a little bit of interest alone...
...That's why they made it so difficult to look at in the first place, wasn't it...?

<Keiichi>
"Rika-chan.
 ......What will happen... to the cat?
 ...Two of the cats that snuck in... well... that night, they......"
...
...I'd heard Tomitake-san and Takano-san's deaths were being kept a secret.
...Rika-chan might not have known about it.

<Rika>
"............Tomitake and Takano?"
I gave a start at the sudden mention of actual names.
 ...Though it's weird to do that at this point.

<Rika>
"......You should forget about them."
Thp...... my spine... froze again.

<Keiichi>
"Fo... Forget...?"

<Rika>
"......Yes.
 It won't do you any good to remember those two, Keiichi.
 ......The more you think about it, the scarier it will get.
 So you should forget about them as soon as possible."
She said something so enormously terrifying... without letting the smile on her face waver at all.

<Rika>
"......I don't know where you heard about it from, but you should forget everything. Make your mind as clean as a scrubbed bathtub."

<Keiichi>
"F-Forget? ...Rika-chan... you know, don't you?!
 You know... how those two died......!!!"

<Rika>
"......No matter how they died, it has nothing to do with you, Keiichi,"
Rika declared this in a flat voice.
...Nothing to do with me.
...So forget about it.
......The girl before me... she was innocent and lovable... and even seemed trustworthy... but suddenly she took on another dimension.
......Don't get involved with their deaths.
 ......I'll help you, Keiichi.
Those two contradictory statements... twisted and distorted my image of the girl in front of me.

<Keiichi>
"...Wh-What about Shion...?
 ...What'll... happen to her......?"
It might have been dangerous to mention Shion's name, but...
...I couldn't stop myself from asking.
...Rika-chan saw through everything anyway.
 ...There was no way I was going to fool her or keep anything from her at this point...

<Rika>
"......The younger of the sister cats?
 Meow, meow."

<Keiichi>
"Y-Yeah.
 ...The little sister cat."
Rika-chan appeared to think upon this for a moment.
...It was hard for me to endure even this momentary silence.

<Rika>
"......The big sister cat is angry.
 The little sister cat did something bad, so she's really mad."

<Keiichi>
"The big sister cat......"
...That could only mean Mion...
 ...I recall being questioned by her yesterday.

<Rika>
"......Keiichi.
 ...The big sister cat is not in a good mood at all.
 ...I think we should leave her alone for a while."
Not in a good mood... Those words sent a shiver through me...
...Mion... was mad.
She was mad... that we entered the ritual storehouse...

<Rika>
"......Let's stop having club from now on."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 ...Wh-Why...?!"

<Rika>
"......I think we should leave her alone."
Rika-chan ended her sentence with such force that I couldn't say anything in response.
...Hey, Keiichi Maebara.
...Don't disobey Rika-chan right now.
......She's the only one... who said she'll help me right now...
I'll leave things to her, just as she said to.
...I mean, she even said... that the cat should just keep meowing...
...I'll forget everything... like she said.
 I'll leave everything to her.
......I'll forget everything—about Takano-san and Tomitake-san, and what I did that night...!
Just then, we heard a bell, far away, marking the end of our lunch break.

<Keiichi>
"I... guess we should go back to class..."

<Rika>
"......Keiichi."
As if she had noticed how miserable I was, about to leave everything to her and flee the scene... Rika-chan called out to stop me.

<Rika>
".........If the misunderstanding dog comes to try and bite the cat, please tell me, okay?"
The misunderstanding dog...
...She put it in such a cute-sounding way... but the true meaning behind those words... was an eerie one.

<Keiichi>
"......Who is... the misunderstanding dog?"

<Rika>
"......The dog that bit the mayor.
 ......I don't know why it did that.
 If it was going to bite anyone, it would have been the trickster cat first."
...The flow of blood in my body... felt like it completely stopped for a moment.
......Rika-chan had admitted it.
...The sacrifices of that terrible calamity...
 ...she admitted that if they were to happen again, it would be Shion or I.
This... I didn't know what was true about the girl standing before me...
...My suspicion gave way to fear... and nearly began to change into anger...
Was she... a savior who would protect me...
 ...or a stranger... trying to capture and kill me for the sake of a horrible tradition?
 ...I had no idea what was true......

<Rika>
"......I'm sorry.
 ......The cat is already scared... and I said something to scare it even more.
 ...I'm really sorry."
Rika-chan bowed so quickly it looked like her head had been pulled downward.
...Still... she was right. I was cowering.
 ...I could distinctly feel my body shaking violently.
So when Rika-chan reached her hand out to pat me on the head... I pulled away without thinking...

<Rika>
"............"

<Keiichi>
"...Ah... I'm s—..."
Rika-chan made a very sad face... but I just couldn't bring myself to put out my head for her again...
That day, Rika-chan said she wasn't feeling up for club activities, so she suggested we don't bother.
There's always vetoes when someone doesn't feel up to it.
 ...Rena and the others seemed really disappointed...
...The big sister cat is not in a good mood.
I remembered Rika-chan's words... and quietly stole a glance at Mion's expression.
If I could forget the way she questioned me yesterday though, her behavior was the same as it always was...



[Watanagashi Ch.12]

After dinner, without the energy to watch TV... I climbed into the futon in my bedroom... and let my head be overtaken by gloomy thoughts...
I told Rika-chan anything and everything.
...She had seemed trustworthy at the time... but had that really been the right choice...?
The more I looked back on it... the less I understood what Rika-chan was saying.
......Not only did she know about Takano-san and Tomitake-san's deaths... but she spoke of them as if she were a concerned party.
...After all this time... in my futon... I began to tremble fiercely...
Had I been... lured in by Rika-chan's sweet smile... and told her things I shouldn't have...?
...I should have continued to feign ignorance...
I shouldn't have shown her such a weak side of me...
My emotions are a mix of regret and fear... and it colored the darkness of the night with an additional layer of terror.
Suddenly, a knock!!
......I might have yelped.
 That's how surprised I was.

<Keiichi's dad>
"Keiichi!
 I've been calling your name for a while!
 You have a phone call.
 ...It's from Sonozaki-san."
It was Dad.
I reached out for the cordless phone through the gap in my door.

<Keiichi>
"S-Sonozaki-san...... which one?
 The older sister, or
 the younger...?"

<Keiichi's dad>
"...I don't know.
 Ask her yourself."
...I took the receiver... and buried myself in my futon again.

<Keiichi>
"......H-Hello...?
 ......Mion?
 ...Or is it Shion?"

<Shion>
"It's me.
 ...Shion.
 Good evening."
I practically jumped out of bed.
...It was Shion—who I hoped so desperately would call me back last night.

<Keiichi>
"Shion! ...Umm,
 ...Sorry about... last night.
 ...I got all riled up..."

<Shion>
"............"
I heard what sounded like a deep sigh on the other end...

<Keiichi>
"...You and me are in the same position, aren't we?
 ...I shouldn't have blamed you for everything like that.
 ...I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry, so please, cheer up..."

<Shion>
"I called you because I'm in a better mood.
 ...If you're sorry, then I'll forgive you, so please stop apologizing."
Shion's tone still sounded a little angry, but for the moment, she said she'd forgive me.

<Shion>
"...You're right, too—we're tied to the same fate.
 Making sure the other is alright is the only way to guarantee our own safety."

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah... I agree."

<Shion>
"...We absolutely need to share whatever information we have.
 ...So that we don't die, like Takano-san and Tomitake-san did."
...Gulp.
 ...I forced myself to swallow a solid drop of saliva.

<Shion>
"Then... let's continue from where we left off.
 ...You'll listen without getting angry this time, right?"

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah.
 ...I'll be fine."

<Shion>
"Firstly.
 ......It seems sneaking into the ritual storehouse was... more of a taboo than we thought."
............Takano-san and Tomitake-san's miserable ends, terrible enough that you could call them a warning... they were more than enough to make me believe that...

<Shion>
"......The culprits killed those two, the ones responsible for sullying the storehouse... and they'll come for us next.
 ...I know you want to deny that... but please accept it. 

<Shion>
...It'll be too late to believe me after you've disappeared, okay?!"

<Keiichi>
"I-I got it.
 ...You can never be too careful, after all."

<Shion>
"I don't... want to accept it either.
 ...To think that sneaking a peek at that museum of torture devices deserves a death like that... I don't want to believe it...!"
......That's what a taboo is.
...For those who honor it, if one breaks the taboo... no matter how small or innocent their intentions were... they wouldn't be forgiven.

<Shion>
"...Let's report anything we noticed that seemed strange. 

<Shion>
...If we connect all the tiny pieces that we have... then just maybe we'll find out who killed them... or maybe even the truth behind the incidents of the previous years. 

<Shion>
We could find the key that'll resolve everything."

<Keiichi>
"...Mm... you're right.
 ...You're right about that."
All I was doing was waiting in fear... but Shion had already thought that far ahead...
...Given how trustworthy she felt, I became embarrassed over how passive I was being...

<Shion>
"...Then I'll start, since I suggested it.
 ...I feel like somebody has been watching me lately."

<Keiichi>
"What...?!?!"

<Shion>
"......It might be my imagination, but...
 I'll tell you anyway.

<Shion>
...I think it's just me, but... if you feel like you're being watched too, Kei-chan, then...
 ...Maybe it's not just my imagination..."

<Keiichi>
"W-Well... Don't worry.
 ......At the very least... Everything's been fine for me."
...I think.
......As I spoke with Shion, I thought back on today.
...I had no grounds to say that everything was fine...

<Shion>
"......I see.
 ...Then I suppose it was my imagination... but you be careful too, Kei-chan.
 Be especially careful when you're by yourself in public. 

<Shion>
...I'm in Okinomiya, so I won't be alone very often, but you live in Hinamizawa.
 ...There will be a lot of times you'll be alone.
 ...Please be extra careful."

<Keiichi>
"......You're right.
 Yeah... I'll be careful."

<Shion>
"...Also... about my sister...
 Has she been acting strange lately?"

<Keiichi>
"Your sister... oh, Mion, right.
 ...What do you mean by... 'acting strangely'...?"

<Shion>
"...Well, yesterday, I... she came to me and asked me where I was on the night of Watanagashi."

<Keiichi>
"What?! Th-That's... She asked me, too.
 ...The day before yesterday, I think... Mion asked me..."

<Shion>
"......I see.
 ......I told her I wasn't there.
 ...What did you say?"

<Keiichi>
"I did the same thing.
 ...I just dodged the question."
...Both of us gave a quiet sigh of relief.

<Shion>
"...Ever since the night of the festival, my sister has been acting strangely.
 ...We can't be too careful... so just be aware, okay?"
......Mion was acting strangely...
.........Aside from her asking me about the night of Watanagashi...... she hadn't seemed too out of the ordinary.
 ...At least, from my point of view.
...Her twin sister, though, was saying she was acting weird.
...Maybe it was such a slight change that a stranger like me wouldn't be able to notice...

<Keiichi>
"......Got it.
 ...I'll start being careful.
 ...I'll always have Rena with me on my way back from school, so I shouldn't end up alone with Mion very often..."

<Shion>
"Please, be careful.
 ...If there's anything that's bothering you, you can tell me."

<Keiichi>
"All right."

<Shion>
"...Okay, then is there anything you want to tell me, Kei-chan?"
......My turn.
......That's right. Maybe I should report on Ooishi-san asking me the same question at the library.

<Shion>
"...Oh, that time when you were too slow to escape?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.
 Ooishi-san asked me pretty forcefully...
 whether I was with Takano-san and Tomitake-san that night, and whether I had seen you.
 ...Ooishi-san seemed to have seen the four of us together."

<Shion>
"...From the police's point of view, that would make us the last people who had seen them.
 I suppose, given that, it's only natural that they'd be interested in us."

<Keiichi>
"...I evaded the questions then, too... but that might have just made them more interested."
There was no way I could have tricked that sly old fox Ooishi-san.
......My troubled countenance would have only made him even more certain...

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Shion.
 ...Since they're the police... shouldn't we just tell them...?
 I mean, considering our situation, I think having them on our side would be a good thing..."
Shion didn't answer right away.
...For a few moments, all I could hear was her breathing as she thought about it.

<Keiichi>
"...Now that I think of it, Ooishi-san said there was something possibly shady about Mion... At least, I think that's what he said.
 ......Yeah.
 ...Yeah, he definitely did."

<Shion>
"...As I explained yesterday, the Sonozaki family holds a lot of influence over Hinamizawa. 

<Shion>
......Ooishi is under the impression that the whole village, with the Sonozaki family at the center of it all, is responsible for the recurrent freak deaths."

<Keiichi>
"...The whole village is behind them... with the Sonozaki family at the center...?!"
...Please, don't get angry like you did yesterday, and just listen.
I hammered that home before I got too upset.

<Shion>
"...During the Hinamizawa Dam Wars, the priest who everyone was anticipating to lead the anti-dam movement acted as though he were unrelated, so the Sonozaki main house rose up to take charge. 

<Shion>
...My sister told you about all the battles that happened, right?"

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah.
 All of Hinamizawa got together and fought as one.
 They held protests, brought it to court, and even appeared on TV..."

<Shion>
"In reality... there were many things that happened that were far more extreme.
 Under the surface... the Sonozaki main house was doing all sorts of illegal things to oppose it."

<Keiichi>
"......They were acting illegally...?"

<Shion>
"For example, they would sneak into the construction site in the middle of the night and steal equipment, or break it, or put sugar cubes in the gasoline tanks of the construction vehicles."

<Keiichi>
"...Sugar in their gasoline tanks??
 Why would they..."

<Shion>
"You don't know?!
 It's practically the representative guerilla tactic. It was used by underground organizations in France in WWII, for one.
 When you put sugar in, the engine gets burned out and breaks down."
......That's... that's pretty bad, though, isn't it?
It was destruction of property, and nothing less...

<Shion>
"When they beefed up the guard at the construction facility, the family turned to attacking important construction personnel who worked there.

<Shion>
...The government officials who had given permission for the construction, for example, received all kinds of threats. 

<Shion>
Not just people from the prefectural office, either—apparently this reached as far as the Ministry of Construction.
 ...As far as I've heard... they even kidnapped a child once."

<Keiichi>
"K-Kidnapped?!?!"

<Shion>
"Yes.
 The child of an important person in the Ministry of Construction who was in charge of the Hinamizawa dam got spirited away. 

<Shion>
...Then, one day, all of a sudden, he was rescued in the Takatsudo Mountains, which are upstream from Hinamizawa.

<Shion>
...Apparently there were never any criminal accusations... but people whispered that it had been a threat to stop the dam construction from happening. 

<Shion>
...Besides that, there are stories about so many different threats that I couldn't possibly list them all."

<Keiichi>
"...That's... wow, that's... sort of bad, isn't it...?"

<Shion>
"Right in the middle of the whole thing...
 ...the first incident happened.
 ...That's when the dismemberment of the construction manager occurred. 

<Shion>
...People whispered that the Sonozaki family had bought out the principal offender... but of course, he fled and they still haven't found him."
......When she put it that way...... the Sonozaki family definitely seemed suspicious.

<Shion>
"Ooishi-san even seems to think that the criminal was 'erased,' so he wouldn't talk.
 ...Which is pretty reasonable of him.
 ...It's even enough to make me think... 

<Shion>
...that the Sonozaki main house is doing some really shady things behind the scenes, even though I'm related to them."

<Keiichi>
"......Are you telling me... to believe that...?
 ...That the Sonozaki main house, where Mion lives, has done all those bad things... you're telling me to believe it...?"

<Shion>
"Even if you don't, Kei-chan, the villagers do.
 ...While they opposed the dam in upright and lawful ways, the Sonozaki house did the dirty work for them. 

<Shion>
...Everyone believes that—that they fought at the front, so they'd take the brunt of the criticism.
 ...So they're respected as sort of heroes of darkness."

<Keiichi>
"............"

<Shion>
"I think I only really know one part of it.
 ...For example, the really bad stuff, like the kidnapping—I think only a handful of people even know about it, including Grandma. 

<Shion>
...The Sonozaki family is secretive, after all."

<Keiichi>
"......Secretive, huh..."
......A family so unforthcoming that even Shion, who is related to them, doesn't know everything about them.
The Sonozaki family.
...Unlike Shion, her older twin, Mion, was deeply involved with everything... and that was not a fun thought to entertain...

<Shion>
"My sister, though young, was the one who acted as the center of the illegal resistance movement."

<Keiichi>
"Mion was...?!
 Wh-What do you mean...?"

<Keiichi>
"......Mion did... that...?"

<Shion>
...She learned that her age could be used as a weapon."
...It may have been indiscreet... but I couldn't help but chuckle dryly.
...She may have been young... but she was certainly still Mion.
Even back then, she had already been known for her craftiness...

<Shion>
"It's nothing to laugh about!!
 Please, take this seriously!!"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, ...sorry. ...I didn't mean to..."
Shion had gotten pretty angry at me.

<Shion>
"...Well, her delinquency soon got her into a position of authority in the Sonozaki main house.
 ...It's not unthinkable that Ooishi suspects them for the dismemberment incident, and the later ones too."
............For a few moments... I was dumbstruck at the tales of Mion's past.
None of them matched the image I had of her.
...A younger Mion, dirtying her hands with all sorts of crimes, giving the dam construction project hell.
...As the successor to the Sonozaki main family,
 she was always right at the center of the vortex of strange incidents occurring year after year...
...Was that... really the Mion I know...?
Maybe the one I know... isn't the real Mion?
I couldn't figure it out.
...I couldn't bring myself to accept these images of Mion I was hearing from another person.

<Shion>
"Well, back to the main subject.
 ...I just wanted you to know that my sister is someone worth being cautious around.
 ...Please, be careful."
.........I didn't want to understand.
......Mion was a fantastic friend.
...She would never do something to back me into a corner like that...
...She did ask me pretty harshly about the night of the festival... but even that... it wasn't like she'd said it in a mean way or anything......
............

<Keiichi>
"......All right.
 ...I'll make sure to be careful."

<Shion>
"We're sisters related by blood... but within the Sonozaki family, we're basically of a different class.

<Shion>
...I want you to recognize how distant my position is from hers.
 ...Please."
......The more Shion tells me about Mion... the less I understand who Mion is.
...The Mion I know... wasn't a dangerous person...
...She joked around... smiled a lot... and was full of passion............
Now that I'd realized I held such a view towards her... Shion was telling me to change it.
.........To be careful around the best friend ever.
 ...To doubt her.
...The idea was very sad... and painful...

<Shion>
"Now, about Ooishi.
 ...If you think it's a good idea, then I think we should give him the information he needs.
 ...I think getting the police on our side will work in our favor."

<Keiichi>
"...You thought so too, Shion...!"

<Shion>
"...It's just... at the moment, like I explained, the police have their eyes on the Sonozaki family already.

<Shion>
Ooishi in particular completely believes that they're the masterminds behind the serial incidents.
 ...That includes me, of course.
 ...So... I don't really want much to do with Ooishi."
......I see.
...If Ooishi-san had found out about the Sonozaki family's strife-filled history... then he probably wouldn't be very happy with Shion, either.
...At last, I understood Mion's instinctive dislike for Ooishi-san.

<Shion>
"...It's probably out in the open at this point, but try not to give my name to him.
 ...If you agree to that, then I don't think there's a problem with you telling him anything."

<Keiichi>
"I got it.
 ...I won't mention your name."

<Shion>
"...The police's investigative ability should be quite a reliable weapon for us right now.
 ...If Ooishi tells you anything interesting, then let me know as well."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, of course.
 We'll share information and investigate together.
 ......Who killed Takano-san and Tomitake-san?
 ...Who was after us?
 ...Until we know... we need to defend ourselves..."

<Shion>
"...Anything else?
 Besides what Ooishi told you, I mean?
 ...If anything has happened, no matter how minor, please tell me."
...Aside from my discussion with Ooishi-san?
...Oh,
 ...should I tell her... that I revealed everything to Rika-chan?

...Rika-chan was acting like she knew something I didn't.
......She told me to leave it to her...... but what.........
Ah, that's right...
When I was talking to her... I mentioned Shion's name, too.
...Was that a mistake...?
......I felt like Shion would get angry...

<Shion>
"...Nothing else?
 ...Kei-chan?"
I had remained quiet for a little while, so Shion encouraged me to speak, unable to bear the silence.

<Keiichi>
"...Ah, ...ummm..."
As I struggled with what to say, Shion addressed me instead.

<Shion>
"It doesn't sound like it, so can I ask you something?
 ...I just heard this myself......
 Is it true... that old man Kimiyoshi went missing?"
...The old man Kimiyoshi?
 ...My gut told me that was the name of the mayor.

<Keiichi>
"You mean the mayor...?
 ...Wait, Shion... you haven't heard?"

<Shion>
"I don't know anything!
 ...I just overheard my dad talking about it on the phone again."
I realized I shouldn't have said that.
......Here in Hinamizawa... the things that happened around this time, when Oyashiro-sama's curse would recur... would all be covered up.

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah.
 Actually... last night, after a meeting, he didn't come home, so all of Hinamizawa was confused.
 They searched all through the village, but if they've found him, then I haven't heard... 

<Keiichi>
The police should be searching for him as well......"

<Shion>
"Wh-Why didn't you tell me something that important right away???!!"

She shouted angrily at me, bringing all her emotion to bear...!

<Keiichi>
"S-Sorry... I thought you already knew...
 I didn't want to hide it or anything...!"
The receiver was silent.
...Did Shion... get mad again and hang up...?!

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Shion! Hello?!"

<Shion>
"............Kei-chan...
 ...What...
 .........What should I do...?"
Shion's tiny, confused voice sounded like it belonged to a different person than the one yelling a few seconds ago.

<Keiichi>
"...What's wrong?
 ...Tell me.
 We're not keeping secrets from each other, right...?"
Shion hesitated for a long while... but then she confessed.

<Shion>
"...I'm sorry.
 ...I... well, I didn't mean to hide it.
 ...It was just that, well, the conversation got turned around and..."

<Keiichi>
"...We're on the same side, right?!
 I won't get mad, so tell me honestly..."
...Shion still hesitated for a few moments.
 ...Then, in a resigned voice, she continued.

<Shion>
"I...
 .........
Old man Kimiyoshi, I...
 ...I told him everything."
Shion seemed to think I would yell at her right after she said that, so I heard her catching her breath.
...Contrary to what she thought... I was a little relieved.
...Shion had done the same thing I had when I confessed everything to Rika-chan.
...So... in as gentle a voice as I could, so as to not set her off, I responded.

<Keiichi>
"......Old man Kimiyoshi... he's someone you feel comfortable confiding to, Shion...?"

<Shion>
".........Yes.
 ...He would... when I was little, he was really nice to me..."
......Shion felt the same pain as the rest of us from the mayor's disappearance.
...She had a different kind of strength from Mion... and as she continued, her voice sounded truly sad and pained.

<Shion>
"...All I did was play tricks on him... but he would always just smile...
 ...He listened to anything I had to say...
 ...He was such a kind person......"

<Keiichi>
"...C-Calm down, Shion.
 ...It's not like he's dead, right?
 Don't lose heart so easily..."
......Shion didn't answer.
...Even as I said it myself... I didn't think we'd ever find the missing mayor again.
...We probably... wouldn't even figure out if he was alive or dead.
...Shion must have been thinking the same thing...

<Shion>
"......That night...
 ...I told the mayor...
 that we snuck into the ritual storehouse.
 ...Also that someone saw us... and was out to get us."

<Keiichi>
"...Does the mayor know how absurdly Takano-san and Tomitake-san died...?"

<Shion>
"......Yes.
 ...He knew about it.
 ...I told him that they died by Oyashiro-sama's curse... and that I could be made a sacrifice to calm his anger.
 ...I just said it straight out."

<Keiichi>
"......Right.
 ...What then?"

<Shion>
"...Old man Kimiyoshi... didn't get angry.
 ......He smiled, then told me that if I was properly sorry about it, there was no way I'd be demoned away...

<Shion>
...He was really...
 ...smiling...
 ...and he told me to leave it to... him......
 ...ngh...!!"
Until Shion stopped sobbing... I was unable to find any words for her.
I couldn't imagine what kind of person the mayor was, nor what Shion's relationship with him was like.
...Words of comfort, however, mean so much to us when we're about to be crushed by anxiety...
 ...Today, Rika-chan taught me that, too...
If someone who gave me such a sense of security were to disappear......
...Then I could guess what kind of shock Shion was in...

<Shion>
"............It's my fault.
 ...Because I... I revealed everything..."

<Keiichi>
"...Stop it, Shion...
 ...It's not your fault."

<Shion>
"No!!
 It is my fault!!
 I... I told him everything...!
 Old man Kimiyoshi found out about everything...!
 So... he has to have been killed!!
 ...It was right after I told him, after all!! 

<Shion>
He disappeared the same night that I confessed... and he told me everything was going to be all right!!!"
He found out,
 so he became involved.

<Shion>
"I should never have told him!!!

<Shion>
All of this... should have just been our fault! Only the four of us!!
 It wasn't something I should have told to someone else!!
 He got killed because I told him!
 He got killed because he knew!

<Shion>
He got killed... because I revealed it!!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Hey, stop!!
 If they were doing that... then they would obviously have killed you before killing the mayor!
 The order is all wrong!!
 You or I should have been killed first!! 

<Keiichi>
Why the hell would someone else get killed first?!!"

<Shion>
"No, it's in order!!
 They must be planning to kill us last of all!!"

<Keiichi>
"...Hah...? Wha...
 ...What?!"

<Shion>
"...They're not killing the first people who come to mind... they start by killing those we're close to... and then after they've caused us so much pain, they'll kill us... That must be what they're doing!!"

<Keiichi>
"I said, calm down!!
 Shion, you're in shock! You're panicking!!
 The mayor's disappearance has nothing to do with you!
 It's unconnected!
 It's not related to Takano-san and Tomitake-san dying at all, either!!"
...My words came out as a scream... as if I were shouting them at myself.

<Shion>
"No!!
 It is connected!!
 It just has to be!!
 I told him, so he was killed!
 He got killed because he knew!
 I confessed it to him...... so he got killed!!!!"
She repeated the same thing as before as though she were in a delirium.
...Despite my trying to console the crazed Shion... for some reason, the shadow at my feet began to freeze...
From that shadow... a cold arm reached out, so cold it seemed like it would freeze even my heart just by touching me... and grabbed my ankle.
 ......The heat generated by my body... the arm was absorbing it...
It was a horrible... chill.
 ...A freezing cold, numbingly frigid.
 ...It was an inviolable... chill of fear.
...Though I sympathized with Shion, I had been naive in thinking it was something only she had to worry about...
...In my head, Shion's eerie words repeated again and again.
He was killed because I told him.
He was killed because he found out.
I confessed everything...
 so he was killed.
Those words echoed through my head like a monotone mantra... and finally, those even repetitions took on meaning.
...The quiet shaking that had already overtaken me... turned into a violent shiver that shot up my spine!!

<Keiichi>
"...Ri...... Rika-chan!!
 It's Rika-chan!!!!"

<Shion>
"......What?
 ...What did you say just now...?!"

<Keiichi>
"I... I, well...
 ...The truth is...
 ...I...
 ...I told her about it.
 ...I told Rika-chan...
 ...today!!"

<Shion>
"Rika-chan... You mean Rika-chama?
 The one from the Furude Shrine?"

<Keiichi>
"Yes, Rika-chan!
 ...I felt... I felt so scared and uneasy... that I did it.
 ...I told Rika-chan."

<Shion>
"......When you did...... what did she say...?"
...The cat is worrying too much.
 I'll do something about it for sure.
That's what Rika-chan said... and then she smiled.
...She smiled, just like the missing mayor had when he encouraged Shion...

<Keiichi>
"......I-I'm sorry, Shion!
 I-I-I... I'm a bit... I'm worried about Rika-chan...!!"

<Shion>
"Ah, right!
 ...If you're that concerned, then don't worry about me.
 Please, go find out whether she's safe."

<Keiichi>
"...Y-Yeah!! I'll do that!"

<Shion>
"I'll call you again tomorrow at the same time.
 When I do, you'll know I'm still alright."

<Keiichi>
"...I got it. I'll be waiting.
 Okay, bye!
 Sorry!
 I'm hanging up!!"
I put down the receiver without waiting for Shion to say goodbye.
...The danger to Shion and myself was secondary at this point.
......My sixth sense was blaring alarms in my head.
...I don't like this feeling.
 It's really bad.
 ...It's definitely, definitely bad!!!

<Keiichi>
"...Damn it... Please be safe...
 ...Rika-chan!!!"



[Watanagashi Ch.13]

After hanging up on Shion, I searched for Rika-chan's phone number on my school's contact list.
...There it is!
My fingers trembled with urgency, and I failed multiple times to put in the simple 5-digit number.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi...
 Are you calling someone at this hour?
 It's late, and it's being rude to the other person..."

<Keiichi>
"Th-That doesn't matter right now!!"
I shouted angrily at my mother, listening to the dial tone.
 ...Pick up... Come on, pick up...!!
The time... was 11 PM.
It certainly wasn't early.
 It was essentially the middle of the night.
...Had Rika-chan already gone to bed...?
Her phone would be ringing constantly, though, so... would she get back up for me?!
Rika-chan... didn't pick up.
...She didn't pick up.
.........She didn't pick up!!
Maybe she just happened to miss it.
...Maybe her bed was just...
 too far away from the phone...
...The sound of a phone ringing gets clearer and clearer the longer you go on sleeping.
...Then...
 the bathroom...?
 ...Yeah, she must be taking a bath!
If that was the case, then even if she heard the phone, she wouldn't be able to pick up...
...It was a little late to be taking a bath... but it was possible she normally took baths right before going to bed.
............I'll wait thirty minutes, then try calling again...
Even as I was thinking that, I called her house over and over again.
I kept calling.
Over and over, again and again, I kept on calling her, but...
...she didn't pick up even once.
I think I kept trying for about thirty minutes.
 ...Yet, she wasn't picking up.
Were my phone calls so persistent that she had gotten scared of picking up the receiver?!
...No, that couldn't possibly be it......
............
There was no point in doing this any longer.
...The best thing to do would be to go there in person...!
Where was Rika-chan's house, though...?
Shit... I've never even asked her where she lived...!!
...Her residence was written there in the contact list, but it was an address with mostly numbers, so I couldn't tell where it was just by reading it.
...Isn't there a map or something in here?!
Rika Furude.
 ...Her last name was Furude.
It was a bit of an odd last name, so it might be easy to find...!!
Thinking that, I rummaged around the drawer with the phone book, but could only find things like takeout menus and phone numbers for public establishments...!
Shit, shit... shit...!!
I tore one thing after another out of the drawer... but I didn't come up with any clues as to where Rika-chan's house was.
Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...!
If you don't know... then just ask!
 Ask someone who does know!

<Keiichi>
"...Ah, that's it.
 ...Rena's gotta know!"
I looked up Rena's phone number on the contact list.
...Rena Ryuugu.
 ...There she was.

<Rena's dad>
"...Hello?
 This is Ryuugu."
It was the voice of a grumpy-sounding man.
...It must have been Rena's father.
 I am calling in the middle of the night—I need to be polite......

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm sorry for calling so late at night.
 This is Maebara. Is there any chance Rena-san is around...?"

<Rena's dad>
"Reina is taking a bath...
 ......Oh, she's done?
 ......Reina.
 There's a friend of yours on the phone."
Oh, right. "Reina Ryuugu" was her real name, wasn't it?
...I'd gotten so used to calling her "Rena" that hearing her real name caught me a little off-guard.

<Rena>
"Hello?
 This is Rena."

<Keiichi>
"Ah... i-it's me, Keiichi.
 Sorry for calling so late...!"

<Rena>
"Huh?
 Keiichi-kun?
 What do you need at a time like this? Like this?"

<Keiichi>
"...Well, actually...... I wanted to know where Rika-chan's house is."
Rena seemed... a little appalled that I'd call her for something like that at this hour.
However, she spoke her next words seriously, as if she'd caught on to how urgent my need was.

<Rena>
"O-Okay.
 Sure.
 You know the assembly hall on the grounds of the Furude Shrine?
 There's a two-story shack used for storage behind it.
 That's where she lives."
...I couldn't immediately visualize the place, but as long as I knew she lived on the shrine grounds, I'd just have to take a look around.

<Keiichi>
"G-Got it!
 Thanks.
 Sorry again for calling so late.
 Apologize to your dad for me too, would you?"

<Rena>
"Okay, but, Keiichi-kun...
 why do you want to know where Rika-chan lives?"
Rena asked in an unusually sharp way, halting me before I could hang up the phone.
......I hesitated for a moment about whether to tell her.
<i>He was killed because I told him.</i>

<Rena>
"......Keiichi-kun?
 If you're still listening, could you answer me?
 Why are you asking where Rika-chan lives at a time like this?"
Rena affected her usual tone... but beneath her words lay a certain tension, like she'd intuitively sensed something was going on.
......What will you do, Keiichi?
If it's Rena... can't I tell her...?
<i>He was killed because he found out.</i>
<i>I revealed everything...... so he was killed.</i>

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun?!
 Rena is being serious.
 Please answer me!"
Rena asked me once again in a tone so forceful I couldn't imagine her ever using it normally.
 ...I was taken aback by her vigor.
......Rena was Rika-chan's friend, too.
...She had the right...
 ...to be concerned about Rika-chan disappearing.
...If I told Rena, then...
......even if only for a moment... I could drive away my horrifying fears!

<Keiichi>
"...Rena,
 ...well...
 ......I can't exactly tell you why, but......"

<Rena>
"Yes?"
Rena's tone was seriousness itself.
...Just from that tone, I could feel her saying...
 No matter what you say, Keiichi-kun, I'll believe you.
......That subtle sense of security gave me the courage to reveal the truth...

<Keiichi>
"I have a feeling...
 ......that Rika-chan is in danger."

<Rena>
"...You mean like a premonition,
 or do you have some reason to believe she's in danger...?"
...I really didn't have time to go back and forth with Rena about this.
...Still, I think listening to her calm voice soothed my pointless impatience.

<Keiichi>
"...I don't have much... reason, but......"
Yet, I still hesitated.
...I had told Rika-chan that we had snuck into the ritual storehouse.
The mayor, to whom Shion had confessed before that, had already disappeared.
So... it was possible that Rika-chan also...
...I didn't know how to explain it to Rena.
...While I was tongue-tied, Rena spoke up.

<Rena>
"Sorry for asking something so weird.
 I thought about it, and it isn't like you need to be sure."
Rena laughed a little, seeming a bit absentminded.
...I wasn't exactly in the mood to laugh, so this time I was dumbfounded.
Rena continued in a cheerful, yet still purposeful voice.

<Rena>
"You're worried about a friend.
 I don't think you need a reason to go and check on them.

<Rena>
...Even if Rika-chan was asleep and you ended up waking her up, if that was why you did it, then none of us would get mad."
......Rena...... Thank you...

<Rena>
"Okay then, Keiichi-kun, just one thing.
 ...You called Rika-chan's house, right?
 Then you just couldn't get through, so that's why you asked me where her house is?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah... that's right!
 I must have called her for over ten minutes.
 ...She could just be sleeping and not have noticed..."

<Rena>
"Rika-chan's house is really small.
 She would definitely hear the phone ringing even if she was asleep.
 Satoko-chan is there too, so there's no way neither of them would notice."

<Keiichi>
"...Huh?
 Satoko... you mean she's living with Rika-chan...?"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 You didn't know?
 ......Well, we can talk about that later!
 ...Anyway, if you called that much and no one answered, then something's definitely wrong."
Rena understood that the situation wasn't normal far faster than I could have ever imagined her to.
It made her seem dependable...
However, the fact that Rena had acknowledged this also meant that the best-case possibility of it all just being the result of my own needless fears went out the window.

<Rena>
"I'll go to Rika-chan's house right now.
 Will you come with me?
 I can show you the way."

<Keiichi>
"Sounds good.
 Let's meet up at the same place as usual!
 I'll be waiting for you!!"

<Rena>
"No, wait!
 I'll come get you at your house.
 You just wait there,
 and tell your family you're coming with me to Rika-chan's house, okay?"

<Keiichi>
"...Will that be okay?
 We might lose time if you come here..."

<Rena>
"Did you call Mii-chan too?
 She's really dependable at times like these!
 If you haven't, then I'll give her a call!!"
My thoughts froze for a moment.
...Shion had just told me to be careful around Mion during our phone conversation a little while ago.
...If the Sonozaki main house was... somehow lurking behind the surface of the annual freak deaths...
...then the current heir to the family, Mion, wouldn't be uninvolved...
So... wouldn't that mean she wasn't uninvolved in what happened this year to Takano-san and Tomitake-san, and also the mayor's disappearance...?

<Rena>
"Okay, bye!
 I'll be right over!
 Wait for me!!"
That's all Rena said before hurriedly hanging up.
...Now wasn't the time to be doubting Mion.
I needed to make sure Rika-chan was safe.
I got changed and grabbed the key to my bike.
I figured things would go more smoothly if we met up in the place we usually do before school.
...Rena wouldn't need to come all the way to my house.
My parents would probably have objected if I told them I was leaving, so I creeped out without a word.
The night was unusually warm... and disagreeably humid.
...She said that Rika-chan and Satoko live together, right?
......?!
Then it wasn't only Rika-chan...
 Satoko wasn't there either?!
Realizing what them living together really meant caused my thoughts to immediately take a turn for the worse.
That can't be...... Satoko is...
 ......She's got nothing to do with any of this!
Even if there were a reason for Rika-chan to disappear...... there shouldn't be one for Satoko......!!

<Rena>
"Ke... Keiichi-kuun...!!!"
Rena was really fast.
She approached me on her bike at an amazing speed.
...Her breath was ragged, painting a clear picture of just how hurriedly she'd been going.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Rena!
 Let's get going!!"

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun.
 I thought I told you to wait at your house."
Rena's expression was all business.
...Was she mad?
 It came out of the blue, and I faltered for a moment...

<Keiichi>
"W-Well... I just figured it would be faster to meet up here..."

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun... Don't you get it?!"
Rena shouted, clearly angry.
 ...I'd never seen Rena like this before.

<Keiichi>
"D... Do I get it...? What's the problem...?"
Rena seemed to notice she was scaring me, took a couple of deep breaths... then continued as if admonishing me, but...
 her expression didn't soften at all.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun.
 ...The whole village is in an uproar now that the elder disappeared, right?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah......"

<Rena>
"Now you're telling me that Rika-chan and Satoko-chan aren't where they're supposed to be, right?"

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah...
 Th-That about sums it up......"

<Rena>
"Then you need to be more careful!!!
 Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to be standing out here alone in the middle of the night?!"
...I began to understand where Rena's anger was coming from...

<Rena>
"You told your family you'd be going to Rika-chan's house with me, didn't you?
 ...So that in the worst case scenario...
 ...If you and I were to disappear... people would know when and where we did."
......Rena was... perfectly level-headed in this emergency situation.
Ever since the night of Watanagashi...
Every night, someone had died or disappeared.
On the night itself, Takano-san and Tomitake-san met strange ends.
...On the next night, the elder vanished.
...Now, on the next night after that, Rika-chan and Satoko were nowhere to be found...
...I hadn't been thinking of anyone but myself, but...
 It wasn't enough to say that Hinamizawa was a little weird at the moment—it was, in fact, extremely strange...
Rena had even anticipated our own disappearances, and had told me to tell my family where I was going.
...I was embarrassed at my own carelessness,
 and the need to be embarrassed made me afraid of the night.

<Keiichi>
"...Sorry.
 ...I didn't tell them yet."

<Rena>
"Okay.
 Then let's go tell them together!"
With Rena beside me, I wheeled back towards my house.
...The moon seemed strangely high in the sky.
...A sky that was uselessly vast and cold,
so that no matter what, it would never seem to me like a dream—this cruel fact had already confronted me.
On such a crazy night, Rena had been unimaginably dependable...
...Hinamizawa's metamorphosis, enough to make Rena caution me against carelessness...
 ...was, to me, the most fearsome thing of all...
The moon seemed... strangely high in the sky.
We met up with Mion on the way, and she, of course, was unsure whether to believe me about Rika-chan and Satoko's disappearance.

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan, are you serious?
 I'm going to get really mad if this is a joke."
Mion was clearly displeased.
 ...If this were a joke, it wasn't very funny.
...I understood how indiscreet my words were.
Ever since the day before yesterday, someone had either died or vanished every night.
...Rika-chan and Satoko disappearing after all that was something you just couldn't say, even in jest.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan.
 If it really is a joke, don't get mad, smile.
 It would be a joke, after all.
 ...We need to go make sure whether it's a joke or not."

<Mion>
"......You're right.
 ...Sorry for getting upset."
However indiscreet a joke it may have been, if we learned that our friends were safe, it would end up as nothing more than a funny story... 
Having been warned about that by Rena, Mion gave a dry smile, the tension she felt loosening a bit.
She mounted her bicycle as well.
Our three bicycles' lights flashed down the pitch-black roads—they were some of the only illumination outside.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, why did you suddenly decide to call and ask about Rika-chan's house at a time like this?"
...Mion asked me the same thing that I had trouble explaining to Rena.

<Keiichi>
"...Would it be weird to call it... a premonition?"
I couldn't quite tell because it was dark, but I thought I could see Mion smiling very ambiguously.
...I definitely understood that she wasn't convinced, though, despite the darkness.

<Keiichi>
"Well, I had this bad dream while I was snoozing, and I couldn't get it out of my head."

<Rena>
"So... did Rika-chan get kidnapped in the dream...?"

<Keiichi>
"......Well, hmm...
 ...It was more of a vague feeling... sort of thing.
 ...If Rika-chan had answered the phone, I would have called you and Rena after that."
Lies smoothly babbled out of my mouth, makeshift though they were.
I was lying because I thought telling them I was connected to Shion... would be like silently admitting we'd stolen into the ritual storehouse together that night...
Mion didn't press me any further.
...I don't know whether that convinced her.
Or maybe she figured that making sure Rika-chan and Satoko were safe would be faster than making an issue out of it.
I felt relieved, and immediately a little guilty...
...Mion hadn't really been acting any differently these last few days... but I'm still trying to distance myself from her for some reason.
It was only because of what I heard from Shion and Ooishi-san: that she was the successor to some kind of super-extravagant gang family...
......No.
......Was I just trying to force myself to forget?
Don't do that, Keiichi Maebara.
...Wasn't it... wasn't it Mion who was the first to ask about the night of Watanagashi?
...In such a harsh tone, at that?
 Have I already forgotten the terror I felt?
...At the time, Mion looked like... someone different from the Mion I knew.
...When I think about that Mion...... then Shion and Ooishi-san's descriptions of Mion made a tiny bit more sense...
That's it, isn't it?
...If it wasn't for how she acted that day... then I wouldn't be feeling this way towards her now.
...What on earth... was going on with her back then?
...I was conveniently thinking only of everything she had done after that...
 while disregarding the very first thing—the thing I should have been looking at most, wasn't I...?
Mion was pedaling her bicycle in front of me, her long hair fluttering in the wind.
...No matter how long I looked at her back, it never gave me answers to any of my questions...
We went all the way to the stone steps leading up to the shrine grounds.
Of course, we weren't going to want to haul our bikes up there,
 so we parked them beside the staircase instead.

<Keiichi>
"...So this is the Furude Shrine."

<Rena>
"Everybody comes and goes as they please, as if it were a park, but this place is actually a grand estate owned by the Furude family."
So the entire shrine is private property.
...It really makes you feel the passage of time.
...Ten or twenty years ago, it would have looked the exact same.

<Keiichi>
"...Then wouldn't that mean... that the Furude family is really old?
 With a history going back for generations...?"

<Rena>
".........Yeah.
 They're gone.
 That's odd."
Rena said something clearly disquieting, so I ran over to her.

<Keiichi>
"What's wrong, Rena?"

<Rena>
"......Rika-chan and Satoko-chan always leave their bicycles here.
 ...See?
 They're gone."
I took a look around.
...Indeed, there were no other bicycles aside from the ones we'd taken to get here.

<Keiichi>
"Couldn't they have parked them somewhere else?

<Keiichi>
......Could they have brought them up the stairs?"

<Rena>
"Those girls couldn't do that, Keiichi-kun."
Just as she said, I couldn't imagine Rika-chan and Satoko lugging their bikes all the way up there.
...We hadn't yet knocked on Rika-chan's door, but reality was already sparking some ideas that weren't what you'd call good.
...Maybe they were just parked under some trees and we hadn't noticed them.
I refused to believe that not being able to find their bikes here was proof that they'd disappeared...

<Keiichi>
"Let's go...!
 The only way to be sure is to check their house!"
We all nodded and dashed up the stone steps.
We passed through the red arch and came out onto the shrine grounds, which was covered in neat gravel.
...It was so quiet here, as though the Watanagashi festival had never happened.

<Keiichi>
"...So, where's the house they live in?"

<Rena>
"Over here.
 Come with me."
Rena took the lead and sprinted off.
 ...We went towards the assembly hall behind the shrine, then looped around behind it.
In the darkness of the night, we found a small, prefab two-story shack that looked like a warehouse.

<Mion>
"...The lights are off.
 ...Are they sleeping?"

<Rena>
"Let's knock."
Rena and Mion neared the shack, which didn't really look like a place people would live.
...They had such a beautiful shrine, so... I'd figured they'd live in an equally beautiful house.
 ......It was far from what I had expected.

<Rena>
"Rika-chaaaaan!!!
 Satoko-chaaaan!!
 Are you theeeeere?!"
Rena shouted up towards the second floor.
 Her voice was restrained at first, but it steadily grew louder.
............No answer.

...In fact, there wasn't any sort of activity in the house at all.

<Mion>
"...They might be sleeping.
 Let's wake them up."
Mion banged on the shutter with both hands, and the loud sounds echoed into our surroundings.
...They would have to notice this much noise.
...They would turn on the light in their room, fling open the windows, and yell "what time do you think it is?!"
......That, however, wasn't happening.
 .........There was absolutely no response.
Mion stopped slamming her fists on the shutter, and a sudden silence fell over us.
...The silence... aroused terrible thoughts in us.
...I could feel the blood draining from my face...

<Rena>
"It's locked...
 ...I wonder if we can get into somehow..."
Rena showed no signs of stopping.
It didn't look like she would admit they weren't there until we went inside and saw for ourselves.
...That refusal to give in gave me strength.

<Keiichi>
"The second-story windows wouldn't be locked.
 ...I'll give them a try!"

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, a ladder."
Mion brought over a ladder that was standing against the house.
The footing was a little unstable for me to be climbing it, but Mion held the ladder firmly in place for me.
I hadn't climbed too many ladders.
...My inexperience with them exposed, I climbed up one step at a time... and tried to open each window on the second floor.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, I'm going to go check the main house just to be sure, okay?
 I'll be right back!"
Rena darted away.
 ...What? A main house?

<Mion>
"It's the Furude family's actual house.
 After her parents passed away, I think it's been left like that."

<Keiichi>
"....Ah... right.
 ...Rika-chan's parents... they passed away, huh?"
At that point, I recalled something else.
 ...Wasn't Satoko living here too?

<Mion>
"Satoko's also an orphan.
 ...Her parents fell from a cliff because of Oyashiro-sama's curse.
 ...Then her older brother, Satoshi-kun... he disappeared..."

<Keiichi>
"...Satoshi... I've heard that name before."
I remembered.
 ...He was the one who disappeared last year because of the curse.

<Mion>
"Ever since then, Satoko and Rika-chan have been living in this shack.
 Neither of them has any family, but at least they're together.
 ...They help each other out."

<Keiichi>
"......Rena said 'main house,' didn't she?
 Wouldn't it be easier to live there...?"
The curtains were drawn, so I couldn't get a good look inside to see, but...
 two young girls living together... seemed like a pretty tough life.

<Mion>
"I think she tried that at first.
 ...She said it was hard, though, because it reminded her of her parents."

<Keiichi>
"............"
...I had no idea... I feel really bad for them.
...They were normally so cheerful at school that I never even realized an atom of this...

<Keiichi>
"...Rika-chan...... and Satoko-chan... they have it hard, huh?"

<Mion>
"She's cursed."

<Keiichi>
"...Huh?"
Suddenly... Mion said something in such a low voice that it sounded like she was really cursing someone, and I didn't let it slide.
I turned around on the ladder to face her and asked again.

<Keiichi>
"...Mion... what... did you just say?"

<Mion>
"I said, she's cursed."

...Mion, still holding onto the ladder, brought her head up to look me in the eyes.
...As soon as our eyes met, an absolute zero jolt of electricity surged through my body.
Mion's eyes clouded over... and within them boiled and bubbled... a stew of chaos.
They whirled around and around like a raging sea... and bubbles floated to the surface...
...I had at some point... been trapped on this ladder... like being cornered on a dead-end street.

<Keiichi>
"......Mi... Mion, you... Why are you making that face...?"
I intended to follow that up with "you're going too far with this joke" and give her a forced smile.
...However... on such uneven footing as I was... the only thing that came out of my mouth was a hoarse groan as I desperately struggled to not let nausea overwhelm me.

<Mion>
"Satoko Houjou...
 ...She's been cursed by Oyashiro-sama."
...Mion answers... with a response to something I never asked... as if replying to somebody else's question.

<Mion>
"The only people who fell from the park observation platform were her parents.

<Mion>
Only her parents, who treated her like dirt, died that day.
 She was the only one to survive.

<Mion>
...Then she was sent to live with her aunt, who treated her cruelly, and the aunt was killed on the night of Watanagashi by some deviant, who beat her to death so violently her brains were everywhere and her head an entirely different shape by the end of it.

<Mion>
...Then Satoshi-kun, who always protected her...
 He suddenly disappeared on her birthday.

<Mion>
Someone made him disappear, even though he wasn't abusing her.
 ...The police judged him to have run away from home, but Satoshi-kun wasn't the kind of person who would do that.
 He was always earnest. 

<Mion>
He would never ask for anyone else's help—he would always drag himself through everything with hard work alone. 

<Mion>
He worked so hard he nearly ground his bones into dust, all for his one and only little sister—and yet someone made him disappear.

<Mion>
She was the only thing he lived for, and yet someone made him disappear.
 Poor, poor Satoshi-kun.
 He was never rewarded, that Satoshi-kun.
 How ungrateful that child is.
 ......She is cursed.

<Mion>
 All who get near her suffer the same fate.
 The curse kills them,
 or the curse makes them disappear.
 She cannot have any relief,
 she cannot have any relief. 

<Mion>
......It's probably Satoko's fault that Rika-chan disappeared, too.

..."
Mion was mumbling words over and over that were no longer coherent.
...Her shoulders were trembling so hard that I could feel it through the ladder.
I almost lost my footing... which made me realize just how far away the ground really was.

<Keiichi>
"C... Calm down, Mion...!!
 I-I don't know what you're talking about!!"
I wasn't sure if she even heard me.
......Mion rocked back and forth, and that rocking and trembling was becoming even more violent...
H... Help me......
The ladder... i-it's falling......
 Help me...
 ...Help...!!
Just then, I heard the sound of many people running towards us.

<Keiichi>
"Oh... oh, heeeyyyy!!
 O-O-Over heeere!!!!"
I very nearly said "help me" outright.
Four or five adults, led by Rena, ran over here with flashlights.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, Mii-chan, sorry I took so long!
 I borrowed the key!"

<Mion>
"Oh, nice one.
 Seems all the windows and doors are perfectly sealed.
 I was getting worried."
...When I heard Mion talking like nothing had just happened... I again felt a chill run through me.
The person currently holding the ladder in place—it was definitely Mion.
It was the real Mion Sonozaki.
......Then...
 ......the person muttering to themselves...
 ...just a few seconds ago...
 ...who was that...?
The person who was mumbling about terrible things... like curses... who was that...?
...I jumped down from the ladder as if running away, before Mion turned into that person who wasn't Mion a second time.
The adults tried a few different keys on a keyring as they tried to open the big shutter on the first floor.

<Rena>
"Rika-chan's house used to be a disaster shelter for the town council.
 So the key to the shutter is still kept in the mayor's house."

<Mion>
"It's Rika-chan and Satoko's private residence now, though.
 ...Well, this is on Rika-chan's property anyway.
 Nobody complains about it."
Mion gave me a smile as she said that.
...I, however, could only return her gaze with an aghast expression.
...Mion was acting all-too-normal now, but that only contrasted all the more sharply with her earlier un-Mion-like creepiness.
Bang! ......Bam, clatter clatter clatter..... bang!!
The shutter opened up for the first time in a very long while.
Rena located the light switch and wasted no time going inside.
 I followed her in.

<Rena>
"Rika-chaaaan!!
 Satoko-chaaaan!!
 If you're here, say something!!"
We climbed a narrow staircase.
...It had looked like nothing more than a warehouse, but now that I was inside, I could feel how lived-in it was—it was a person's home.
...Somehow, the scent of the two of them filled the place.
This was definitely where Rika-chan and Satoko lived.
The first floor doubled as a town assembly warehouse, but the second floor was a space entirely for living.
Just like a one-room apartment, past the kitchen was a living room taking up about 150 square feet.
Dressers, cupboards, and the like were packed into the space, and in the corner there was a huge pile of clothes that appeared to have just been taken in from drying outside.
In the center of the living room was a fold-up table, and on it were small containers for things like soy sauce and salad dressing... The sense of a frugal lifestyle drifted from all of it.
It was strange that they weren't here in the middle of the night like this.
...The adults, climbing the stairs one at a time, began to make a fuss and talk amongst themselves.

<Mion>
"......So?
 Not here?!"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 ......They're not here.
 This is definitely weird."
The village had just been thrown into chaos yesterday because of the mayor's disappearance.
...Then today, even Rika-chan and Satoko had...
"...Were they out playing somewhere together?"
"That can't be."
"Their bicycles aren't here, though."
"Where would they have gone so late at night?!"
"Have they just not come back yet?
 Where did they go?!"
The adults put forth various possibilities, and the house immediately devolved into a state of confusion.
...Eventually, Mion settled them down.

<Mion>
"...I don't want to believe it, but... the mayor, Kimiyoshi, disappeared yesterday.
 ...We can't say that this is unrelated."
...The adults' faces paled at Mion's declaration.
 My and Rena's did as well...

<Mion>
"Let's see... They could have gone nearby for some tea or something, then accidentally fallen asleep.
 Whoever invited them might just not be able to wake them up at all, too. 

<Mion>
...Let's eliminate that possibility first.
 Makino-san, please go around to the houses near the stream.
 Keitarou-san, go look near Ojaga Lake.
 Okamura-san, you..."
Mion promptly gave directions to the villagers.
...The adults followed them without hesitation, despite her age.

<Mion>
"We'll remain here and call up anyone we can think of on the phone.
 Okay, everyone, you have your orders!"
"Got it!"
The adults all roared in reply and pounded back down the stairs below.

<Rena>
"...Wow, Mii-chan.
 You're not only chairperson of the school, but Hinamizawa too!"

<Mion>
"No time for jokes!
 Hey, step aside.
 This old man is using the phone."
Mion grinned proudly, took the receiver, and got started.
Rena gave Mion a trusting look, considering her dependable for doing all of this.
My feelings, though, were... a little more complicated, since her leadership seemed to be affirming the 'Sonozaki family successor' impression that Shion and Ooishi-san had given me...
...Stop right there, Keiichi Maebara.
None of that matters right now.
 The most important thing is to make sure Rika-chan and Satoko are safe!
Let's see... couldn't there be a clue hinting at where they might have gone somewhere in this room?

<Keiichi>
"...Still, though... I wouldn't know what to look for anyway."
If we tore the whole place apart and figured out what was different from before, we might be able to speculate, but...
 there was nothing strange about this room, and there were no clues in sight.
In the first place... I had never been here before.
...There was no way for me to know what was different if I didn't know how the room usually looked...
...Hey, don't give up, Keiichi Maebara!
Stop thinking and start looking!
 For something!
In search of something, I tried pulling open the dresser drawers and opened the windows.
...I didn't uncover anything meaningful, though.
Rena, also unable to stand around doing nothing, was looking around the room like I was.

<Keiichi>
"...Rena.
 I don't think you'll find Rika-chan by opening the refrigerator or the cabinet underneath the sink."

<Rena>
"I just thought they might be hiding...
 Ha... Hau~..."
As we were searching, it got noisy outside.
...Villagers were quickly assembling here, having heard the commotion.
Of course, a lot of them were probably people Mion had called.

<Mion>
"I'll go tell everyone what's going on.
 ...The police will be here sooner or later, too.
 We'll need to explain the situation to Ooishi."
Mion began descending the stairs, and we followed her out to the front of the house.
There were already around ten adults there...
 and all of them looked uneasy.
I suddenly noticed that the old people from the shrine were here as well, and they were praying for Rika-chan's safety, rubbing their prayer beads.
......This had gotten bad...
This wasn't just a problem between friends anymore.

<Man>
"Mion-chan, is it true that Rika-chan and Satoko-chan aren't anywhere to be found?!"
The villagers all formed a ring around Mion, swarming her.
Mion raised her right hand, as if silently telling them to calm down.

<Mion>
"First, let's check every house according to the town council's notification division and see if they're visiting anyone. 

<Mion>
...After all, they could be fast asleep at someone's house and totally unaware that we're looking for them."
...It would definitely be hard for someone to wake up Rika-chan if she had eaten a good, full meal and fallen asleep like a kitten afterwards.
 ...Oh, how nice it would be if that were the case.

<Mion>
"......I don't want to think about this, but it's also possible something bad has happened."
Mion's face grew remarkably more grim, and a wave of silence washed over the adults...

<Man>
"We should divide up the work, too.
 We'll go around to all the places we went last night while looking for the mayor."

<Man>
"...We'll go look around the dam construction site as best we can.
 You guys go search around the school."

<Man>
"Right!
 Let's get a move-on!!
 Come on, let's go!!"

<Mion>
"...All of you were up all night looking for the mayor.
 ...I know you're all low on sleep, but please, do your best!"

<Men>
"""Got it!!!"""
With that as their signal, the adults scattered in every direction.
I figured I should scatter somewhere as well... so I started walking unsteadily in a direction no one else had gone in.
I was getting farther and farther from people.
...I didn't feel scared or anything, though.
...If someone were made to disappear, Shion and I should be first.
It would have been perfectly normal for me to be scared of the dark.
...However, I didn't feel that way.
 ...Why was that?
It was because tonight... 
someone had already disappeared.
...So, nobody else would disappear tonight...
It would take some time before I, exhausted as I was... would feel guilt at the cause of my own selfish sense of relief.........



[Watanagashi Ch.14]

...Suddenly, my vision cleared, and a cold wind caressed my body.
...This was... the hill from which you could see the whole village...
Looking down from this hill, I could see lights on here and there... and knew that the entire village had awoken from its slumber.
...First Takano-san and Tomitake-san, then the mayor... and now even Rika-chan and Satoko had been sacrificed... and word of it was spreading everywhere...
The strength in my knees left me.
 ......This could... no longer be a joke.
We could have found them. Mion would have told me I was a worrywart, Rena would just be glad we did,
 and they would have smiled at me...
...My hopes disappeared as if I were awakening from a dream.
 ...That was what the view I could see was telling me.
...Following my knees, my arms both bent forward onto the ground... and I clawed at it with my nails.
...I couldn't figure out if I was feeling sorrow or frustration...

<Keiichi>
".........Uuh...
 ...Is this... my fault...?!"
...I couldn't... endure the burden of my own sin... and I had just told Rika-chan about it......!
They had nothing to do with it, but Rika-chan and even Satoko... had been sacrificed...!!
...It was like a cross... that Shion and I would each have to bear the weight of until we ourselves were erased.
...Well... if I'm going that far, then the problems started long before that.
 ...My original sin... of breaking taboo... and entering the ritual storehouse without asking.
I knew I shouldn't have gone in there from the start!
...Yet I... lost out to cheap curiosity...
I hadn't felt so angry at myself until this very moment......
There was a crunching sound.
...I wasn't even interested in who made the noise, despondent as I was.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun?
 ......Keiichi-kun!
 Are you okay?!"
It was Rena.
...Perhaps my clawing at the ground made it look as though I was having stomach pains.
...She ran over and rubbed my back, to make me feel better.

<Keiichi>
"......I...
 ...This is all my fault.
 ...It's because of me...
 ...It's my fault..."

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun's fault?
 You didn't do anything wrong.
 Please don't blame yourself for this..."
I could tell Rena was doing her best to choose the right words out of consideration for me.
...That's why I could sense her intent behind those words.
<i>Keiichi-kun, you know why Rika-chan and Satoko-chan disappeared, don't you?</i>
 ...is what she really meant to say.
...Because it was an emergency, Rena had ignored the reason why I wanted to make sure Rika-chan was safe, but...
...Now that we'd actually confirmed her disappearance, it was only natural Rena would start to wonder about why.
...However...
 ...with the situation having gone this far... I couldn't possibly tell her now.
I didn't want to admit that Rika-chan and Satoko had disappeared... but I couldn't let Rena disappear either.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun.
 If you stay here out here in the wind, you'll catch a cold..."

<Keiichi>
"............"
Rena sat down, bringing her eyes level with mine.

<Rena>
"...They told us that children should go back home to sleep."
Rena showed me her watch as she said that.
 ...It was long past one in the morning.
...Time was passing too quickly...
......Had I been crawling around here for that long?

<Rena>
"If we don't sleep soon... we'll have trouble getting up for school tomorrow.
 Even the adults are really worn out, since they were up searching for the mayor last night too. 

<Rena>
...They were saying they'd break up a little earlier tonight."
...I was a little upset that they weren't allotting as much time to this as they had to search for the mayor last night... but that was something I, the cause of everything, had no right to criticize them for...

<Rena>
"It's all right.
 The police arrived a little while ago.
 Look, there's police cars coming into the village right now."
Hearing that remark, I looked down at the village to see that there were indeed more cars than one would normally expect at this hour, coming from the darkness on the other side of the mountain.
...However, none of their emergency lights were on.
 Of course, their sirens weren't wailing, either.
...That's right.
...All of the incidents that occurred right after Watanagashi were seen as the product of Oyashiro-sama's curse... and would be handled in secrecy.
Rika-chan and Satoko too... their disappearance would end up exactly like the other serial incidents in the past—
surreptitious,
 unresolved,
 declared a mystery...
 and disappear from memory.
Rika-chan's face... her sweet face, like a western doll's... would fade away.
...Satoko's smile... her energetic, fanged smile... would fade away.
...The more I tried to remember them, the less I would be able to...
 I deserved to be called an idiot dozens of times over, and it wouldn't be enough—I couldn't hold back the tears at my own sheer stupidity.

<Rena>
"...I don't know what you're blaming yourself for, Keiichi-kun... but you should stop."
I wasn't about to deny it. I couldn't.
Even so, I couldn't affirm it, either.
...I wanted to at least keep Rena out of this.
...<i>If she found out... she would become involved</i>...

<Keiichi>
"...Please, Rena.
 ......Could you just leave me alone?
 ...Even if I went home... I wouldn't be able to sleep."
...If I couldn't get to sleep... then I at least wanted to search for Rika-chan and Satoko until I collapsed.
...The entire village was looking, and yet they still hadn't been found.
...I don't think... I'd be able to find them if I went looking alone at this point.
...Still... I had to do it...

<Keiichi>
"......They disappeared...... because of me.
 ......I couldn't possibly... go to sleep... while other people are out there searching..."
I had said that to myself, in self-deprecation... but I soon realized that Rena was silently trying to find the meaning in my mumblings.
...I realized I had misspoke.

<Rena>
"......It's Keiichi-kun's fault?
 Why do you think that? Why?"
That can't be.
Keiichi-kun, you're not at fault.
...I was happy that Rena said these things to me... but she only did so because she didn't know the truth.
...If she knew that everything had been caused by my breaking taboo on the night of Watanagashi, then even Rena would curse my existence...
...However, I can't even allow for those curses.
...That would mean confessing my own crimes to Rena.
If I spilled even one word of having snuck into the ritual storehouse on the night of Watanagashi... then even Rena... could disappear tomorrow night.
......The gentle,
 spirited,
 always joking,
 always hau-ing,
 ......but at a time like this, the most dependable person in the world... Rena might... disappear.
I don't want that.
 ...Anything but that!
This time... I need to bear my own cross.
 Alone.

<Rena>
"............Keiichi-kun, I know that you always have your friends in your heart.
 I can really understand feeling like you want to kick yourself.
 ...Rena knows, though, that it's not Keiichi-kun's fault. 

<Rena>
You didn't do anything wrong, Keiichi-kun, and I know that."

<Keiichi>
"You... you know that...?!"
The shivering in my veins... rushed up my back... and replaced the sorrow in my heart with fear.
I didn't... I didn't tell her anything, did I?!
Maybe I... I accidentally said something that caused Rena to figure it out?!
This is... this is bad...!!
Now... Rena will disappear, Rena will disappear, Rena will disappear...!!
...Then Rena, the same way I always did... grabbed my head and began to pet it roughly.

<Rena>
"......Keiichi-kun.
 Are you thinking... that Rena might disappear now, too?
 .........Because of Oyashiro-sama's curse?"
She puts more force into the hand rubbing my head.

<Rena>
"You don't need to worry about that.
 Rena isn't going anywhere.
 I promise."

<Keiichi>
"...Why... how can you say that... with such confidence...?!"
I mean... someone's been sacrificed every night so far!!
There was no proof that it wouldn't happen again tomorrow night!
...There was even less proof, after all... that the sacrifice wouldn't be Rena...!
......I don't care who you are.
...Just, please, if you're going to erase someone, erase me first...!
Please... stop cruelly getting rid of people we're close to, like the mayor for Shion and Rika-chan and Satoko for me...!!
...Shion's hysterical shouting came back to mind...
They must be planning to kill us last of all.
They're not killing the first people who come to mind... they start by killing those we're close to... and then after they've caused us so much pain, they'll kill us.
 That must be what they're doing.

<Keiichi>
"............Re... Rena..."
Please... don't disappear...
 ...Please, don't... as long as I'm still here...
I could no longer conceal the sobs welling up within me.

<Rena>
"...Come on, Keiichi-kun, crying doesn't suit you.
 Let's go back to the others.
 ...The housewives are cooking some miso soup for us.
 It'll warm you up and calm you down."
Rena prompted me to stand.
...I didn't have the energy to oppose her, so I stood as she urged me to.
We returned to the shrine grounds to find several gas stoves there with miso soup in big pots.
The many villagers there sipped at the soup they were given in dead, stony silence.
Their expressions were absolutely exhausted...
Everyone had just been running around the village until a little while ago.
...From the dreary looks on their faces, though, I assumed they hadn't come up with anything yet...

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan, where did you go?
 I was worried you'd disappeared too!"

<Keiichi>
".........Sorry..."
Mion held out some miso soup for me, but I refused the offer—I didn't have much of an appetite.

<Rena>
"...Mii-chan.
 How is it?
 ...Did you find any clues?"
Mion took a sip of her soup... her expression frank.

<Mion>
"...None at all.
 School ended, and they went home.
 Then, the two of them went somewhere on their bicycles.
 ...Moreover, nobody ever saw them riding their bikes, so..."
When it gets dark out in Hinamizawa, people quickly vanish from the streets.
...Aside from adults hurrying back home from town in cars or on bicycles, it was normal to see absolutely nobody walking around outside.
...It wasn't at all strange that nobody had seen Rika-chan and Satoko riding their bikes.

<Mion>
"...It was the same last night with the mayor.
 ...There's no hope."
Mion's apathetic tone pricked my nerves...... but that anger quickly subsided.
She had been doing all sorts of things to try and find Rika-chan until just a second ago.
...If I asked her, she'd probably say she was up all night last night too, looking for the mayor, wouldn't she?
...She must have been far more fatigued than I was.
....Besides, what about me?
...I had spent the time hunched over in indecision, all alone.
 ...I had no right to say anything about Mion.

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan, I know it's hard, but let's turn in for the night.
 ...We just decided we should break up the search for now.
 Drink this and let's call it quits."

<Keiichi>
"............Is this... the end...?"

<Mion>
"...Oh, no, of course not.
 Once it's bright out again, we'll do a thorough search with the police's help.
 They could have gone to Okinomiya, too. 

<Mion>
People are even saying we should go through all of Shishibone City investigating whether there are any witnesses—for both the girls and the mayor."

<Keiichi>
"............"

<Mion>
"Anyway, what happened, Kei-chan?
 Where did you go off to?!
 ...You vanished all of a sudden... I was really worried!"
Suddenly I was on the receiving end, but I didn't have the willpower to respond.

<Keiichi>
".........Sorry... I'll be more careful..."

<Mion>
"Nothing happened?
 There wasn't anyone suspicious spying on or stalking you... nothing like that...?!"
Mion demanded with a serious expression.
...I was being criticized for how inconsiderate I had been.
...Despite being in so much pain.
I was frustrated that I was being criticized... but it was my sin.
...My sin, and I must bear it alone.

<Keiichi>
"......Nothing.
 ...I'll be careful, either way...
 ......Sorry."
Mion, now aware that nothing had happened, heaved a big sigh with her shoulders, looking relieved.

<Ooishi>
"...Oh, my, my, my...!
 I knew I smelled something good coming from over here.
 I'd be much obliged if you'd allow me to have some."
We heard the repulsive voice of a fat man.
It was Ooishi-san, trailed by a handful of police officers.
...He was acting energetically, in a way unfitting given the situation.

<Mion>
"...There's not much left,
 but you can have some if you want."
...Mion didn't like Ooishi-san very much.
Her cold attitude, though, didn't seem to bother Ooishi-san in the slightest.
 It was like splashing water in a frog's face.

<Ooishi>
"Well, now...
 Miso soup leftovers have a bit too much salt for my taste.
 ...Confound it, na-ha-ha-ha...!
 Would you all like any?"
He recommended it to his subordinates, but everyone gave dry smiles and refused.

<Rena>
"...So have the police gotten hold of any clues?"
Rena's smile was warm enough to replace the miso soup.

<Ooishi>
"Don't you worry, little missy.
 Everything's fine!
 We're searching for them reeeeal good.
 Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"
He didn't say a word about having found any new clues.
In other words, there had been no progress.
 ...That sure was an annoying way of beating around the bush.

<Ooishi>
"In any case.
 It really has gotten late.
 ...All you youngsters should get on home and get some sleep.
 It'll be bad for your health otherwise."

<Mion>
"......Yeah.
 Kei-chan, Rena, get some rest.
 These guys get our tax money—they'll handle it from here for us."
...I really wasn't in the mood for laughter.
 In fact, Ooishi-san was the only one laughing like an idiot.

<Rena>
"Okay... seriously, please do your best.
 ...Let's go home, Keiichi-kun.
 It'll be harder to wake up tomorrow if we don't."

<Ooishi>
"Yes, that's right.
 I can always bring you home, if you need.
 Kuma-chan, why don't you bring the car around?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah... no thanks.
 ...We came on our bicycles, so..."

<Ooishi>
"No need to worry.
 We came in a truck.
 We'll just throw the bikes in the back."
We may have gotten pretty sleepy, but we just needed to ride home at this point.
 ...I didn't want to bother the police like that.
...Rena, however, nodded.

<Rena>
"Okay, if you insist, we'd appreciate it.
 ...It's probably safer than if we went back alone."
When I thought about it carefully, I realized that Rena's idea was extremely rational.

<Ooishi>
"Now that it's decided, let's get a move on, shall we?"

<Mion>
"Okay, bye.
 Good night...
 Rena, Kei-chan."

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 Mii-chan, you go to bed soon too, okay?
 ...Good night."
I waved my hand as well, saying goodbye...
......Rika-chan and Satoko... still hadn't been found.
...My unease, however... was steadily being pushed away by sleepiness.
Rena showed the police where our bicycles were so that Ooishi-san could haul them up into their truck.
He prompted us to get into the back seat.
I could hear the springs squeaking as I sat down onto a seat that would normally hurt my rear end... but at this point, it was very soft, and was more than comfortable enough for me to fall asleep on.

<Ooishi>
"Ladies first.
 We'll start with the little miss's house.
 Where do you live?"

<Rena>
"Th-Thank you.
 My house is... well......"
...Rena's voice slowly grew distant.
...I felt myself being sucked into the void of sleep.

<Ooishi>
"...Helloooo?
 ...Maebara-saaaan... are you asleep back there?"
...Hm?
 ...
...When I came to, it was quiet.
 The car was parked.
Ooishi-san was giving me light slaps to the cheek.
...It didn't feel good at all, so I woke up immediately.

<Keiichi>
"...Ah...... ngh... I'm sorry... I just fell asleep..."
Something was being held right under my nose.
...A clump of metal?
 ......It was a can of coffee.

<Ooishi>
"It's lukewarm by now,
 but cafe au lait is good even at room temperature."

<Keiichi>
"...Oh...... Thanks..."
I mechanically took the can and opened the pull top.
...The feeling of the warm, sweet liquid going down my throat... awakened my sleepy mind...
...When my drowsiness receded... I started wanting to know why the car was stopped.... and why I was offered coffee.
Ooishi-san, who had been in the driver's seat, had, at some point, moved to the back.
......Suddenly, I had a very bad feeling about this.
It reminded me of the questioning yesterday at the library.
...It was already too late by the time I realized I'd made a mistake.
...Today, of all days, it didn't look like I would be getting away.
...I had a feeling that until Ooishi-san heard what he wanted to... he wouldn't be letting me go...

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha... Please, don't get all formal on me.
 I'm not going to eat you or anything.
 ...Maebara-san."
Ooishi-san gulped down the last of his coffee, then stretched wide, showing me how relaxed he was.
...That, however, only served to heighten my nervousness.

<Keiichi>
"......Wh... What do you... need from me?"

<Ooishi>
"Need?
 ...Oh, no, nothing really."
You're going to evade the question at this point...?
 What a deeply unreadable man.

<Ooishi>
"Well, I don't need you for anything.
 ...I just thought that you might need something from me, Maebara-san."

<Keiichi>
"...I don't...
 ...I don't need anything."

<Ooishi>
"Oh, I see...
 Really?
 Are you sure there's nothing?
 Nfu-fu-fu-fu...!"
There was only one side door in the back seat of this truck.
 ...In other words, my only exit was blocked off by Ooishi-san.
......I couldn't get away...
.........I could only limply hang my head... and maintain my silence.
Ooishi-san, despite my reticence, relaxed and began smoking a cigarette...
...The cries of the insects outside seemed to be growing longer and longer, to an amount of time that almost seemed infinite.

<Ooishi>
"...Here I was sure that you had something you wanted to talk to me about."
Ooishi-san exhaled a puff of smoke.
...The windows were open, but the tobacco smoke still accumulated inside the vehicle.
How much... did Ooishi-san know?
...What did he know, and what did he want to hear from me?
......If finding out the truth made you disappear... then if I told him, would Ooishi-san disappear too...?
...I had a feeling that I didn't need to worry about that in his case.

<Ooishi>
"...I wonder how all this ended up happening."
Ooishi-san addressed me in a low tone as if he was talking to himself.
...How all this ended up happening...?
How the hell should I know?
 That was... what I wanted to know.

<Ooishi>
"...You know Jirou Tomitake-san and Miyo Takano-san, right?
 I know you do... because I personally witnessed you with them during the festival, along with Shion Sonozaki-san."

<Keiichi>
"............"

<Ooishi>
"Do you know... how Tomitake-san and Takano-san are doing now?"

<Keiichi>
"............"

<Ooishi>
"They've actually... well, passed away.
 They met very untimely deaths."
......Ooishi-san probably played that card in order to surprise me.
...However, I already knew, and didn't display the extreme reaction he expected.

<Ooishi>
"...What's this?
 Hmm... did you already know?"
...Unfortunately, for this question in particular, remaining silent was equivalent to saying "yes."

<Ooishi>
"Oh... so then did you also know?
 ...The reason Tomitake-san and Takano-san were cursed like that?
 ......People are saying that apparently, they went into some forbidden building."
......The storehouse for ritual implements.
......That forbidden shed, sealing away Hinamizawa's blood-stained past.
...Where the mistake that started it all happened...

<Ooishi>
"Do you know about the rumors... that say the mayor and Rika Furude-san were cursed because of that, too?"
............That would mean... it was mine and Shion's fault...
...He was right.
 ...As soon as we... revealed what we did...

<Ooishi>
"What did they call it? A ritual storehouse?
 ...They're saying it was bad luck—the lock to it had been replaced by a simpler one, which made it easier for thieves to get inside."

............What?
This was news to me.

<Ooishi>
"Until last year, it apparently had these big bars and a huge padlock on it.

<Ooishi>
I mean, you know—ever since the priest and his wife passed away, Rika Furude-san has been managing the place, right?

<Ooishi>
Apparently she talked to the mayor saying she wanted them replaced with a lighter, more simple padlock because the bars were too heavy for her."
.........I didn't know anything about those big bars he was talking about... but the lock had certainly been a simple one.
It was a pretty cheap one, too, and it didn't really fit my impression of what a lock for a place you'd store something as important as ritual implements would look like.

<Ooishi>
"...Rika-san is a small girl, after all.
 The bars were heavy with rust, and they must have caused her a lot of trouble. 

<Ooishi>
...So the mayor hired a craftsman and replaced the lock with a simple padlock, so she could open it with a key."

<Keiichi>
"...So... how does that mean it was bad luck?"

<Ooishi>
"Here's what I'm saying.
 ...Thieves couldn't get in with the old, tight lock... The mayor and Rika-san replaced it with a cheap lock and key on their own, so thieves broke into it... 

<Ooishi>
...Apparently, that's how it's going down."

<Keiichi>
"...That explanation's a bit..."

<Ooishi>
"...Letting that slide, certain members of the village delivered punishment upon the thieves who stole into the ritual storehouse, as well as the mayor and Rika-san, who changed the lock... 

<Ooishi>
...At least, those are the whispers that seem to be going around.
 ...Maebara-san.
 ......What do you think?"

<Keiichi>
"...Wh-What do I think?
 ...I don't really know what you mean by 'certain members of the village'..."

<Ooishi>
"The Three Families are the three oldest families in Hinamizawa.
 To give actual names—
 the Kimiyoshi family,
 the Sonozaki family,
 and the Furude family.
 ...They each have quite the lineage, it seems.

<Ooishi>
Long ago, it's said that everything in the village was decided by a council of the Three Families."
The Kimiyoshi family...... old man Kimiyoshi... meaning, the mayor's family.
The Sonozaki family... was Mion's.
...So the Furude family... was Rika-chan's family, then?

<Ooishi>
"After the war, the Sonozaki family quickly expanded their influence. 

<Ooishi>
Practically speaking, after leading the fight against the construction during the dam conflict, they jumped to the top of the hierarchy in Hinamizawa.

<Ooishi>
You see, though, in accordance with the old ways, they still decide important village matters only after consulting with the Three Families.

<Ooishi>
That's why the leaders of the Three Families each have their own address at the start of Watanagashi. 

<Ooishi>
...In other words, the mayor, the old lady currently in charge of the Sonozaki family, and the last remaining member of the Furude family, Rika-san."

<Keiichi>
".........I heard that the Sonozaki family was pretty high up there... so Rika-chan's family... was just as old?"

<Ooishi>
"...Well, as you're aware, she has no relatives at all.
 In reality, the Furude family holds pretty much no influence. 

<Ooishi>
However, it seems like people gravitate towards Rika-san on a personal level, and I hear that many of the village's elderly have blind faith in her."
...It was certainly true that Rika-chan had an odd sort of charisma amongst the elderly.

<Keiichi>
"...So... what are you telling me about all this Three Families stuff for?"
Ooishi-san paused for emphasis, lighting another cigarette.

<Ooishi>
"I've explained a lot, but I suppose it's still not enough..."

<Keiichi>
"...I'm asking because I don't understand."
Ooishi gave me a dry, meaningful grin and blew out another big puff of smoke.

<Ooishi>
"...Members of the Three Families are disappearing one after the other.
 That's what I'm talking about. 

<Ooishi>
...I've read that it's based on some kind of old traditions inherent in Hinamizawa, but I don't know much beyond that."

<Ooishi>
"That's why I'm asking!
 ...The leaders of the Kimiyoshi and Furude families have disappeared, so maybe the leader of the Sonozaki family will disappear next... 

<Ooishi>
...Well, that's just a random idea bouncing around in my head at the moment...... Na-ha-ha-ha!
 Just kidding, really..."

<Keiichi>
"Th-The leader of the Sonozaki family... Wh-Wh-Who is it...?!"

<Ooishi>
"The current leader is the old lady at their main house, but it wouldn't be incorrect to say that practically all the rights of leadership have been transferred to her granddaughter, Mion-san."
The visage of Mion giving prompt directions to the adults while searching for Rika-chan sprung back to mind...

<Keiichi>
"M-Mion...?!
 She's gonna disappear?!"
...I hadn't even thought of that possibility... All my hair stood on end.
 ...That's insane!!

<Ooishi>
"Nobody wants that, right?"

<Keiichi>
"O-Of course not...!!!
 We... we can't allow that!!!"
Clamp.
 ...Ooishi-san grabbed my shoulders with both hands.

<Ooishi>
"Then help us, Maebara-san."

<Keiichi>
".........Uh..."

<Ooishi>
"......If there's anything you've noticed about Mion Sonozaki lately, please tell me."
I was going along with him...?
By the time I'd realized it, it was too late.
Ooishi-san brought his face in closer, almost close enough to ram into me... waiting for my next words.
...This pressure...
 I can't tear my eyes away... from his...
...That moment, I heard a beeping sound.
 ...It was from the driver's seat.
He ignored it at first, but then it started to bother him, so he finally let go of me and leaned into the driver's seat.

<Ooishi>
"......Hello?
 Yep, loud and clear."
I was saved...
Of course, it's not like I could use this opening to escape...

<Ooishi>
".........I see.
 Yes, alright.
 ...Let's head back, then.
 Yes.
 Okay, okay."
...Apparently he was being recalled.
...Now that I knew I'd be freed, the tension in my body dissipated all at once.

<Ooishi>
"It looks like I need to get going.
 Hmm, we were just getting to the good part, too... That's too bad."
Ooishi-san flung open the door, exited, and walked around the front to the driver's seat.
He left the door open.
 ......Did that mean I could leave...?

<Ooishi>
"You really care about your friends, Maebara-san—an admirable trait for a kid to have in this day and age.
 I totally understand that it feels like you'd be betraying them if you told the police anything."

<Keiichi>
"............"

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san.
 It's the middle of the night, so get a good night's sleep and then think about it.
 ...Just a little bit of courage from you might end up being what saves many of your friends in the end."
...Did he want to say that the sacrifices wouldn't stop with Rika-chan and Satoko?

<Ooishi>
"You know this already, but every night since Watanagashi, something has happened.
 ...In the past, the curse only occurred once per year, but this time it's been going on for days. 

<Ooishi>
What a prosperous year this has been."

<Keiichi>
"...I don't think you can call that prosperous."

<Ooishi>
"The night before last,
 last night,
 and now today.
 There's no proof that something won't happen tomorrow night as well. 

<Ooishi>
It's our job to prevent such things before they happen, but for that, we need your cooperation, Maebara-san."
I looked out the opened door... to see none other than my own house, right in front of me.
...It creeped me out that he knew my name and address... but I was too sleepy right now.
 ...I was too sleepy to care.

<Ooishi>
"......Well, you're probably tired.
 It's already three in the morning.
 Please, get yourself a good rest."

<Keiichi>
"...Yes, sir.
 I'll... be going now..."
When I was about to get out of the truck, as if to deliver a parting blow, Ooishi-san said, in a raised voice,

<Ooishi>
"I'll be coming by every day until you feel like talking, all right?
 ...I don't believe forcing you to confess in an interrogation room is really in fashion these days."
I couldn't say anything in response, but me slamming the door shut probably served the same purpose.
After lightly beeping the horn, Ooishi-san's truck drove off...
I went to the front door, without waving goodbye.
...The door was locked, but the chain wasn't up.
I unlocked the door and entered...
...then walked over to the staircase.
............That was where I lost consciousness.



[Watanagashi Ch.15]

...I saw a ceiling I was familiar with.
...Though I was groggy from sleep, I did notice that I was in my futon, like I was every morning.
I looked at my clock... and despite having turned in so late last night, I had awoken at precisely the same moment I always did.
I'm so low on sleep... but I guess you really can get up at the same time every day.
...The secrets of the human body never ceased to amaze me...
If I went back to sleep like this, I would definitely not be waking up again.
 ...I spurred myself on and slipped out of my futon.
Mom asked me about last night at breakfast.
......Apparently we, too, had gotten a call asking if we knew where Rika-chan and Satoko were, and Mom vaguely understood that something serious was happening.

<Keiichi's mom>
"...So then, you were out late last night with all your friends looking for them?"

<Keiichi>
"............Until about three, I think.
 .........Yeah."

<Keiichi's mom>
"...Did you find them?
 Rika-chan and Satoko-chan, I mean."
Crunch.
......I wearily bit into my toast.
 ...It really didn't have any taste.
Just then, we heard the chime go ding-dong.
I looked up at the clock and saw that it was about five minutes past my regular meeting time with Rena.
 ...It was her at the door.

<Rena>
"...Good morning.
 ...Did you get any sleep? Did you?"

<Keiichi>
"...I think I slept for a few hours...
 You could probably count them on a chicken's toes, though."

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha."
Rena seemed pretty sleep-deprived as well.
 ...There was something missing from her usual spirit.

<Keiichi>
"...Are you... going to school?"

<Rena>
"Yeah...
 ......I think it would be better that way."
She said, smiling, albeit stiffly.
...Rena was probably worrying her heart out about those two as well.
...Even so, she wanted to go to school.

<Rena>
"...If you stay home today, I think you'd just be worrying non-stop and sleeping.
 ...I don't want that.
 ...So let's go to school together."

<Keiichi>
".........All right.
 Wait just a moment.
 I'll get ready."
I was... just a little bit happy about Rena mustering that much consideration for me.
We went to the place where we'd usually meet up with Mion, but she was nowhere to be found.
...We were a little bit late today, so we thought she'd be waiting for us...

<Rena>
"...I guess Mii-chan couldn't wake up today, huh?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah... that's right.
 ...For her, it wasn't just yesterday.
 ...She was up all night looking for the mayor the night before last, too..."
We waited for a bit.
 ...Time passed until it got to the point where it was okay for us to go on alone, and we exchanged glances.

<Keiichi>
"What do we do...?
 Wait a little longer?"
At that point, my brain, which had finally been woken up by the morning air... recalled the ominous words Ooishi-san had left me with last night.
......The leaders of the Three Families were disappearing one after the other.
 ...And next... it might be the Sonozaki's leader.
Could Mion have............ No, that couldn't be...

<Rena>
"......Let's go.
 Let's let her sleep for today."
Rena gave me a pat on the back.

<Keiichi>
"...Mion...
 ...She's still here, right?"

<Rena>
"Hm?
 Did you say something?"

<Keiichi>
"Oh... nothing, just talking to myself.
 ...Let's get moving."
The two of us headed to school by ourselves.
On the way, we saw a bunch of our classmates accompanied by their parents.
...It even looked like some of them were being taken to school by car.
Surprisingly, the principal was also standing watch at the school gate.
 I'd never seen that before.

<Principal>
"Good morning."

<Guardian>
"Good morning."
The principal was bowing to our classmates' guardians.
 ...The wooden sword leaning next to him was a little ominous.

<Principal>
"Maebara-kun, good morning.
 Ryuugu-kun, good morning."

<Rena>
"...G-Good morning."

<Principal>
"Your teacher has something important to say, so head straight to the classroom.
 ...All right?"
Rena and I said nothing.
......The madness that only existed at night had finally crawled out into the sunlight...
 ...That's what it felt like.

<Chie>
"Good morning everyone."
The hushed conversations that had been spreading for a while now all disappeared like an illusion the moment our teacher walked in the door.
 ...Silence dominated the classroom.
The principal came in with our teacher as well.
 ...This was clearly not a normal morning.

<Chie>
"...First, the principal has something important to tell everyone.
 ...Go ahead, Mr. Principal."
The principal cleared his throat and approached the dais.

<Principal>
"......I'm sure some of you already know this."
...The classroom was dead silent.
...Everyone was staring at Rika-chan and Satoko's empty seats.
The principal briefly and simply declared... that Rika-chan and Satoko had gone missing.
...There wasn't a single person in the classroom who didn't already know.
 ...There seemed to be many, however... who couldn't accept it as the truth.
It had been confirmed to them now by the principal's words.
...There were sobs throughout the classroom... and I heard a kid crying.
...They steadily spread throughout the whole room...
...The big-hearted principal wasn't able to keep his cool, either.

<Chie>
"Okay, everyone, pay attention!
 From today on, your parents or guardians will be taking you to school.
 For those of you whose parents can't do so, you'll be coming here in groups. 

<Chie>
I made a handout, so read it carefully, and be sure to show it to your parents.
 Understand?"
The teacher's voice was a little abrasive.
...Not even she could conceal the strain she felt from this unprecedented, abnormal situation...
They should have just cancelled school today.
However, Rena told me that the school was also like a nursery for the students whose parents both worked, so some of them wouldn't want school to be cancelled.

<Chie>
"Well then, let's begin the lesson.
 ...Class president... she's absent, I see.
 Then whoever is on day duty, let me hear it!"

<Young boy>
"All rise!"
That feeling of wanting to maintain an everyday atmosphere, even if only in school, precisely because our lives had been messed up... was something that I agreed with at this point.
As for the teacher, who always had her lunch in the staff lounge, she ate in the classroom today.
......I had to laugh at her curry bento—which was just a rumor until now—but there was nobody to laugh with me.
Rena brought her chair and lunch over to my seat.
...Today... it was only the two of us.
 ...The fact that we didn't need to drag any other desks over... was sad.

<Rena>
"...I'm sleepy."

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah.
 ...I don't feel like sleeping anymore, though.
 ...In fact, I'm jealous of the people that could sleep at a time like this. They've got nerves of steel."

<Rena>
"Ahahaha, you're right."
I was sleepy this morning... but my drowsiness had dissipated after coming to school and constantly feeling the incredible tension.
Rena's bento box didn't have its usual luster.
...That was to be expected.
Rena was up for a long time last night, too.
...She wouldn't have had time to make her lunch beforehand.
 Since it's not like she would have gotten up early this morning...

<Keiichi>
"...Grab anything you want.
 Go ahead, you can admit that my bento is better today."

<Rena>
"O-Okay... then I'll have some.
 ...Wow, a chikuwa roll with perilla and cheese? That's interesting."

<Keiichi>
"Rena, yours might have ready-made food in it, but it's pretty good too."
...I realized the two of us were desperately trying to brighten the afternoon mood to its usual level as much as we could.
...I looked around the classroom... and it seemed like we were the only ones trying to do so, surrounded as we were by gloominess.

<Rena>
"......Ufufu!
 Just the two of us sharing our lunches like this... It's sort of...
 well...
 .........sort of like something!
 ...Hau~"

<Keiichi>
"Hahaha... haha..."

<Keiichi>
"............Ahahaha."
Our laughter... grew quieter.
 ...I was the first one to mess up...

<Keiichi>
"Sorry.
 ...I mean... well, I'm sorry."

<Rena>
"......No, it's okay.
 ...It's not your fault."
Our chopsticks... both stopped moving.
 ...We couldn't keep it up any more.

<Keiichi>
"...Rika-chan, Satoko...
 I wonder where they went."
Those words might have sounded too miserable.
...Everyone was thinking it, using roundabout ways to address the topic... but I came right out and said it.
 I heard Rena catch her breath...

<Rena>
"............Yesterday, while you were gone, I heard a bunch of things... so I'll tell you what I know, okay?"

<Keiichi>
".........Sorry again about last night.
 ...Go ahead."
At that time, since they had arrived for support, Rena was helping the ladies' society cook the miso soup we'd had.
They reported all of the information the villagers had gathered, and Rena said she overheard it.

<Keiichi>
"...They didn't know anything important, though, did they?
 Rika-chan and Satoko went home after school, and then apparently went somewhere on their bikes, but other than that..."
Mion had told me yesterday.
 ...We had no clues.

<Rena>
"...Yeah.
 ...The police also said that they probably went out on their bikes to go play somewhere as soon as they got home.

<Rena>
...If they were going out to play somewhere on their bikes right after getting home...
 then they might have gone into town.

<Rena>
...So I guess they concluded they disappeared while in Okinomiya.
 The police were saying how they were going to expand their search to Okinomiya in the morning."
In town...
......It'd make sense why we couldn't find them even though we searched all of Hinamizawa, then.
...Still... something didn't fit.
......I had no basis for thinking that... just a gut feeling.
I revealed something to Rika-chan that was likely very important to her that day.
...Then, Rika-chan had told me to leave it to her.
 ...And then... err, what did she say...
Oh, right—if she didn't work hard, then something bad might happen to the dog, too. I think.
With all the talk of dogs and cats... I still didn't have the faintest idea what she really meant, but... it might have been Rika-chan's way of saying this was a race against time.
...Damn it!!!
I'd selfishly pushed my anxiety on Rika-chan... and tried to run away!
When I thought about it... I shouldn't have run back then.
 I should have asked her more... about the dogs and cats.
...The more I think back on it... I really screwed up!!
...Anyway... I don't think Rika-chan was in a situation where she would just go off to play somewhere.
...Of course, I didn't have any evidence or conviction to base that on.
 It was just a hunch.

<Keiichi>
".........I don't think...
 I don't think she'd go into town."

<Rena>
"You think so too, Keiichi-kun?
 I agree.
 Rika-chan and Satoko-chan must have disappeared in Hinamizawa."
I looked back at Rena, startled.
...I could hear the conviction in those words.
Without replying to my gaze, she took her bento box and went to the hallway.

<Rena>
"...I'm going to go rinse this out."
She timed that in a way that broke off the conversation.
...Suddenly, I got the feeling that the next thing she had to say would be hard to say aloud in the classroom.
I hurriedly grabbed my bento box and followed her.
...Rena didn't go to the kitchenette, but rather to the water fountains out back, where students seldom went.
...The water flowed down onto our bento boxes.
...During that time, Rena didn't say a word.
Then, after making sure there were no other students around, she finally opened her mouth to speak.

<Rena>
"...The whole thing about Rika-chan and Satoko-chan going to town to play and then disappearing...
 that didn't make sense for some reason...... so I decided to investigate a little bit myself."

<Keiichi>
"...Who did you ask?
 What did you ask them about?"

<Rena>
"I asked the ladies' society all kinds of things.
 ...There was a lot of tofu in the miso soup yesterday, remember?
 ...The old lady from the Tomita Tofu shop came, too."
......The Tomita Tofu shop...
...Oh, I remember.
That was one of the stores on the road leading to the hospital.
Those huge lumps of tofu dancing in the bathtub-like cistern always looked nice and refreshing.

<Rena>
"The old lady says she remembers Satoko-chan stopping to buy tofu there on her way home from school."

<Keiichi>
"...Tofu?
 Well, it's on the way home, right?
 How is that a clue?"

<Rena>
"Just listen!
 ...Do you remember when we went to Rika-chan's house?"
Rena stepped away from the sinks and spread her arms wide to recreate the space of Rika-chan's room.

<Rena>
"......There was a pot on her gas cooker, and there was miso soup in it.
 I think there was probably about half of it inside.
 The rest was in the refrigerator.
 They must have been planning to make chilled tofu. 

<Rena>
It was on a plate in plastic wrap."
As Rena explained, she walked around, as if she were really going through Rika-chan's room.

<Keiichi>
"Still, Rena... why does this matter?"

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun.
 When you make miso soup, you put the tofu in last.

<Rena>
That means that Rika-chan, or Satoko-chan, whoever was cooking, was standing there making it up until right before dinnertime."

<Keiichi>
"Right up until...
 dinnertime...?!"
Wasn't everyone saying... that their bikes weren't around, so they must have gone somewhere to play by themselves...?!

<Rena>
"The trash in the countertop bin was put in there really awkwardly, too.
 ...Rika-chan makes most of their food and lunches, but occasionally Satoko-chan does it too.
 So Satoko-chan was cooking that night."

<Keiichi>
"...So that means...
 ...that Satoko, at least, didn't go somewhere to play...
 She was preparing dinner...?!"


<Rena>
"Yeah.
 Then I took a look at the rice cooker, and...
 ...there was rice for two still in there."

<Keiichi>
"...So she made dinner for both of them, but neither of them ate it.
 ...Is that it?"
Rena nodded.

<Rena>
"So next I looked in the fridge.
 There was some chilled tofu, made from the other half that they bought.
 That's not all, either. 

<Rena>
There were a whole bunch of plates with side dishes for dinner, and all of them were in plastic wrap."
...You usually plastic wrap things so that you can have leftovers for the next day.
...My mom does it all the time, too, using them in breakfast or lunch.

<Rena>
"That's right.
 You use plastic wrap to save leftovers for later.
 ...So the fact that they were in the fridge means that they didn't plan on eating them that night, at least."

<Keiichi>
"...Umm...
 ...Is that what it means...?"

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun.
 Think a little harder.
 ...Their dinner was totally untouched and wrapped up.
 What do you think that means?"

<Keiichi>
"......Umm...
 ...Well...
 ...That means they didn't need to eat dinner anymore.
 ...So they would have gone out to eat, or ordered takeout."

<Rena>
"It must have been really sudden, too.
 If they had decided to do that beforehand, they wouldn't have made anything, but...
 ...there was dinner for the two of them.

<Rena>
That means that when Satoko-chan was making their dinner, they really thought they were going to eat it until right before they didn't."

<Keiichi>
"...So, then...
 the theory about the two of them going out to play and then disappearing...
 is wrong..!!"

<Rena>
"Yep.
 ...They disappeared after making dinner, and right before they ate it.
 ...Probably around seven o'clock."

<Keiichi>
"......Where would they have gone at a time like that by themselves without eating...?"

<Rena>
"That's obviously where this is leading.
 ...Keiichi-kun, do you remember?
 On their foldout table, there were things like soy sauce and a chopstick holder."
...There might have been something like that.
 ...I didn't remember.

<Rena>
"The container for the soy sauce...
 it was empty.
 There wasn't even a drop left.
 Chilled tofu wouldn't taste good without it.
 So I looked under their sink for the larger bottle of soy sauce they have."

<Keiichi>
"...You sure know a lot about where they keep stuff."

<Rena>
"Ahahaha, I've been to Rika-chan's house and cooked for them before."
Rena cleared her throat, her face returning to a serious expression.

<Rena>
"Then when I opened the cabinet, the big bottle of soy sauce wasn't there at all."

<Keiichi>
"...It wasn't there... Wh-What does that mean...?"

<Rena>
"Everything I'm going to say from here on is just Rena's idea.
 ......So please listen until the end without saying anything."
...Last night.
Satoko was making dinner like normal.
Rika-chan usually watched TV until the food was ready, so she was probably lying down watching a variety show or something.
Satoko put the tofu in the miso soup, and right when dinner was about to be ready, she noticed that they were out of soy sauce.
So Rika-chan, who had nothing to do, brought the big bottle of soy sauce to a neighbor's house to borrow theirs.

<Keiichi>
"...I don't really know my neighbors that well... Would people be willing to just give her soy sauce?"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 It's not all that uncommon in Hinamizawa."
So Rika-chan rode her bike out to get some soy sauce.
No matter how long Satoko-chan waited, though, Rika-chan didn't come back.
So then Satoko-chan called up the house where Rika-chan was going.
...Would Rika happen to be imposing on you?
 Something like that.
Then the other person must have replied with something like this.

<Rena>
"'...We have plenty of food here, so you should come too, Satoko-chan.
 Rika-chan has already eaten.'
 ...I think that's how they called her out there."
Satoko called Rika a few names in private and wrapped up the dinner she had made for them.
She put it in the fridge so she could use it for breakfast and lunch the next day.
Then Satoko got on her bike too...
 and headed for the house where Rika-chan was.

<Rena>
"Okay, but... this is already pretty strange.
 You don't normally make so much food that you can give it to people who suddenly arrived at your house."
A veteran housewife would never normally make so much food that she could feed two extra people.

<Keiichi>
"...Could it have just been a coincidence that they made too much...?"

<Rena>
"It's still unthinkable."
Rena flatly denied me.

<Rena>
"Since... Rika-chan knew that Satoko-chan had worked really hard to make dinner for them, didn't she?!
 No matter what kind of food she was offered, she wouldn't let Satoko-chan's dinner go to waste."
...This was all only circumstantial evidence and Rena's guesswork.
...Even so, it was all... extremely convincing.
It was the only ray of hope we had to topple this situation bereft of clues.

<Keiichi>
"...Then, Rena.
 ...Where did Rika-chan go... to get soy sauce?!"
That was the heart of it...!!
It would have to be somewhere she'd be comfortable with asking for soy sauce...
 and somewhere Satoko wouldn't think it suspicious that she'd been invited for dinner.
 ...So, who was it?!
Rena slowly shook her head...

<Rena>
"......That's all for Rena's guesses.
 ...These are all just ideas, okay?
 Keep them a secret from the police."

<Keiichi>
"What is there to hide...?
 Even if only half of what you say is right, it should be a good clue for all this..."

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun.
 ...This all means suspecting someone from Hinamizawa.
 ...We can't suspect anyone without a really good reason."
............
I saw a few girls coming over to rinse out their bento boxes.
...Rena cut the conversation short there and returned to the classroom.
I stayed there alone, my body bathed in the lively voices of the cicadas...
...Let's think about this.
...In my own way.
...Rena had barely any information to go on, and yet she'd reasoned out that much.
...So there should be something that only I, who knew far more than Rena did, could deduce...
Ooishi-san said this last night too, but this incident was definitely occurring within Hinamizawa.
...Rena might not have wanted to believe it, but it's basically a given that the culprit is someone from the village.
The trigger for everything was when the four of us trespassed in the forbidden storehouse.
Somebody saw us going in there.
For the culprits, breaking the taboo was a crime punishable by death.
...So that night, Tomitake-san and Takano-san were sacrificed.
There were two left.
 ...Shion and myself.
However, before the culprits bore their fangs on Shion and me... they went after the mayor, to whom Shion had confessed her sin.
Next... they went for Rika-chan, to whom I'd confessed my sin...
 ...Then what about Satoko?
 ...Just a stray bullet...?
By itself, Rika-chan being sacrificed after I'd told her everything was mortifying...
 but Satoko, who was sacrificed for no reason... wasn't that all the more regrettable?
...Everything... was my fault...!!
Who would be the next to disappear?
Would it be... Shion and me next time...?
...Why... Why weren't the culprits going for Shion and me right away, though?
If they had enough power to erase the mayor and Rika-chan, then why not just get rid of Shion and me?
If they went for us... well, I wouldn't like it, but I could still tolerate it.
......What I couldn't forgive was them getting rid of those we'd confessed to.
...Now that I think of it...
 ...yesterday, Shion said something alarming—she felt like someone was watching her.
......So then... was someone watching me as well...?
Strangely, though... I hadn't felt anything like that until now.
...Even though I'm the root cause of everything, I had never once had that impression.
Maybe that was simply because Shion was more cautious than me, and I was just careless.
......That's another story, though.
 ...Let's get back on track.
Why weren't the culprits going after Shion and me?
......I felt like that's where the key to this lay.
...Could it be...
 Was I making a big assumption that I shouldn't have been...?
............
I thought and thought, but couldn't come up with an answer.
The one thing I understood...
 was that I was a concerned party to this case...
 and that I had a duty to watch over it until everything got resolved.
I heard the ring of the bell declaring the end of lunch break...
Would somebody else disappear tonight?
...If nobody else did...
 then I wanted them to get rid of me tonight for sure...
 ...and then put an end to all of this.
Shion's hysterical voice on the phone last night came back to mind.
...They planned to murder those close to us first, make us as miserable as possible, and only then would they kill us...

<Principal>
"Maebara-kun, lunch break is over.
 Go back to the classroom."
At the principal's urging, I returned to the classroom, which was quiet as the streets at night...



[Watanagashi Ch.16]

There were a lot of parents picking up their children after school.
 ...It was just like a kindergarten.
The students whose parents didn't come went home as a group.
We left school with everyone else, following the assigned route.
Even while leaving, nobody said anything funny.
...They all looked like exhausted mountaineers silently marching through the mountains.
...As we went, one left,
 and then another,
 and in the end it was just Rena and me.
I was supposed to escort Rena all the way to her house, but she declined.

<Keiichi>
"...Will you be all right?
 It's not safe to go alone..."

<Rena>
"It would be just as dangerous for you to go home by yourself after bringing me back, Keiichi-kun.
 ...It's still light out anyway.
 I'll be fine."

<Keiichi>
"I see.
 ...Then be careful, okay?"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 ...Huh?
 ...Isn't that a policeman?"
Rena pointed towards my house.
...There was a car stopped in front of it.
From out of that car came Ooishi-san.
 ...He must have been waiting for my return to ambush me.
Ooishi-san started walking over wearing that annoying grin.

<Keiichi>
"...Rena, you should go.
 If you get involved with him, you'll be here for hours."

<Rena>
"B-But,
 what do the police want with you? ...With you?"
............Rena's a good person.
Even when I made a fuss over Rika-chan's disappearance, she never asked me why I did.
...She could have been suspecting me ever since then, and that would have been okay.
Even so, she still hadn't asked me anything.
 ...She didn't try and pressure me into revealing the truth.

<Keiichi>
"......I'm not the culprit."

<Rena>
"I know that."

<Keiichi>
"......That said...
 I can't say... that I'm totally uninvolved... with this incident."
Rena simply listened, smiling like she always did.
...Even though I had insinuated I was related to the incident, she didn't look at me as though she were looking at something dirty.

<Keiichi>
"...I'll tell you next time."

<Rena>
"Okay.
 ...I'm looking forward to it."

<Keiichi>
"...Get going, then."
Rena gave me a slight bow and trotted away.
...Leaving me...
 alone with Ooishi-san, who walked over.

<Ooishi>
"Hello, hello.
 Welcome home, Maebara-san."

<Keiichi>
"...Hello."

<Ooishi>
"It looks like your parents aren't here.
 My my, was I in a bit of a spot."
...He came all the way to my house...?
 ...I could only thank my good fortune that my parents were absent.
...Since neither of them was around at this hour, they would probably be back late.

<Keiichi>
"...I think Dad got called out on business.
 I don't think he'll be back until later."

<Ooishi>
"I see.
 Well, that's convenient, I suppose.
 ...We can do this without giving your parents any strange ideas."
Ooishi-san pushed my back, prompting me to walk.
 ...It seemed like he wanted me to get in the car.

<Keiichi>
"...Are you taking me to the police station?"
...I wasn't the culprit... but I was the cause of everything.
It wouldn't be weird if he wanted to investigate me.
That kind of gave me a resigned feeling...

<Ooishi>
"No, no, I just don't want to stand around talking—we can just talk in the car, that's all.
 Come now, don't be shy."
He opened the back door and urged me inside.
...If I got in, I wouldn't have a very easy time getting out.
...If I said no, however... then this man might really handcuff me and take me away.
...I couldn't refuse—I could only accept in good grace.
The inside of the car had been cooled too much by the air conditioner, and there was a rusty smell coming from the filter, which must have been cleaned only rarely.

<Ooishi>
"Oh, is it too cold?
 I'll turn the car off."
He turned off the engine and it suddenly became quiet—and the voices of the higurashi, with all their cool loneliness, snuck inside.
......Kwakwakwakwakwakwakwa.
It sounded to me like a chorus of voices, lamenting my exorbitant punishment for having harbored such foolish curiosity.
For a few moments... while listening to those voices, I myself lamented... the days that had been twisted and distorted since that night.
Ooishi-san, as if waiting for me to voluntarily begin talking, lit a cigarette and listened to the higurashi...
The silence became deafening... and I was the one who folded first.

<Keiichi>
"...How is the investigation going?"

<Ooishi>
"The investigation?
 Of what?
 There've been so many. Which do you mean? Nfu-fu!"

<Keiichi>
"All of them."

<Ooishi>
"...Well, all right then.
 They're officially secret investigations, and we're under a media blackout, but I'll let you in on them.
 ...Then shall we start from the first incident?"
...The freak deaths of Tomitake-san and Takano-san on the night of Watanagashi.

<Ooishi>
"......On this one, embarrassingly enough... we haven't made any progress at all.

<Ooishi>
First of all, Tomitake-san.
 There are indications on his body that he was assaulted by a group of people, but we have no explanation for him clawing out his own throat and dying.

<Keiichi>
"What about Takano-san...?"

<Ooishi>
"The same—we're in the dark.
 Autopsies for those who are burned to death are reeeeal tough.
 We believe she was doused in gasoline after she was strangled.
 They haven't been very cooperative, even though it happened in our territory.
 ...Oh, that's not really relevant, though."
...So the police didn't know anything other than the fact that the victims died inexplicably.

<Ooishi>
"Nonetheless, the times when the incidents occurred have been generally placed right after the festival ended. 

<Keiichi>
"...Why would they bring a dead body all the way to the mountains?
 ...They should have just brought Tomitake-san out there too..."

<Ooishi>
"Oh my... Maebara-san, you're quite sharp, you know that?
 Of course, I do believe that is something we need to be attentive of. 

<Ooishi>
...There are a bunch of other suspicious things... but this is about all I can tell you at this point."

<Keiichi>
"...How about the mayor?
 Have there been any clues?"
Having exhausted that topic, I changed the subject... otherwise, he might turn the conversation on me...

<Ooishi>
"We investigated his movements on the day he disappeared.
 ...We didn't find anything that could provide any clues, but I'll tell you about it anyway."
The mayor—Kiichirou Kimiyoshi.
...Apparently he was suffering from severe hemorrhoids.

<Ooishi>
"People who've lived a long time have an unusual amount of pride.
 ...So the mayor hadn't been telling anyone that he was going to a proctologist at a certain university hospital in Shishibone. 

<Ooishi>
On the day he disappeared, he had an appointment for a checkup, so he went out first thing in the morning."
Even I knew that big hospitals, like university hospitals, had a really long waiting time.
...Apparently people would get in line hours beforehand, even if they had an appointment.

<Ooishi>
"His exam ended at 1 PM.
 After that, he ate a light meal in the hospital restaurant and passed the time reading a magazine.
 ...We know this because of a receipt we found in his wallet at his house."
...There was nothing suspicious at all about that.

<Ooishi>
"That day, he had planned to go to a meeting in the assembly hall in the evening.

<Ooishi>
...He was supposed to return home with plenty of time to spare, but while he was on the train coming back, there was an accident. 

<Ooishi>
Seems it delayed him a bit, and he only got back to his house right before the meeting was scheduled to start.

<Ooishi>
His family witnessed a very hectic mayor leaving to go to the assembly hall at the shrine."

<Keiichi>
"...What was the meeting about?
 He disappeared on his way back home, right?"

<Ooishi>
"The Three Families and the essential members of the town assembly were at the meeting.

<Ooishi>
We think they were discussing how to deal with the serial freak death incidents that had happened again this year."
...So then... on his way home......
The old man, who had treated Shion like his own daughter.
...He was a dependable person who would encourage Shion whenever she felt pressured by anxiety, and yet...
...Shion's painful voice struck me right in the heart...

<Keiichi>
"Hm?
 ............
 Huh......?"

<Ooishi>
"What's the matter?"
I was taken aback by how strange my own voice sounded.
 ...What was it that just... surprised me...?
I squeezed my head with my hands to try and drag back out what I had only realized for a split second.
...Remember, Keiichi Maebara!!
You just realized something!!
 ...Something important...!!!
The night of Watanagashi.
That was when everything started.
...That night, Takano-san and Tomitake-san died.
...The next morning, word of the incident had spread throughout Hinamizawa.
They planned to talk about it during the evening meeting.
The mayor, however, had an appointment at the hospital, and as planned, he went there without telling his family.
He got a checkup at the hospital,
 ate something,
 and then there was an unexpected delay on his train ride back.
...When he returned, the meeting was already about to start.
The mayor changed clothes, got on his bicycle, and hurried to the assembly hall at the shrine as fast as he could...
From when he heard about the incident on the night of Watanagashi... until when he showed up at the assembly hall.
 ......Everything he was doing that day was done in secret.
During that time, nobody found out that...
 he went to the hospital alone,
 he ate alone,
 and he got on the train alone.
...That all meant he had absolutely no contact with anyone else.
You couldn't have even called him on the phone.
...Okay, but what does that mean, Keiichi Maebara...?
Why does that matter, Keiichi Maebara...?
............Ah—


<Shion>
"............Kei-chan, ...What should............ I do..."

<Keiichi>
"...What's wrong?
 ...Tell me.
 We're not keeping secrets from each other, right...?"

<Shion>
"I............ Old man Kimiyoshi, I... I told him everything."
<i>I told him everything.</i>
 <i>I told old man Kimiyoshi everything.</i>

<Shion>
"...That night... I told the mayor... that we snuck into the ritual storehouse.
 ...Also that someone saw us... and was out to get us."

<Keiichi>
"...Right.
 ...What then?"

<Shion>
"...Old man Kimiyoshi... didn't get angry.

<Shion>
......He smiled, then told me that if I was properly sorry about it, there was no way I'd be demoned away... 

<Shion>
...He was really... smiling... and he told me to leave it to... him......
 ...ngh...!!"
Sweat burst out of my body like bullets.
...They became one long strand... and slid down... down from my forehead to my nose...... and fell.
......So then...
 What does it mean...?
Hey, Keiichi Maebara... No more playing dumb.........
<i>When did she tell him?</i>

Shion said she learned of the incident from a phone call her father had made that morning.
The mayor had left the house first thing in the morning for his appointment at the hospital.
He didn't tell anybody where he was going.
...Nobody knew about him going to the university hospital.
Furthermore... his train ride back to his house was delayed by an accident—as soon as he got home, he rushed out to the assembly hall.
Then the meeting at the assembly hall began...
 ...and continued until it was dark out.
...Then, everyone left.
...Nobody saw him after the meeting was over.
 ...He just disappeared.
Which meant...
 ...Which meant...
 ......Which meant...
 ............Umm......

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san?
 Are you all right?
 If you're too hot, I can turn on the air conditioner, mm?"

<Keiichi>
"............"
Another part of me was messing with my thoughts, demanding that I didn't think any further than that.
My head was pounding violently... and the fluids packed inside it... all blended together until nothing made sense.
It was just about to settle, yet it had been smashed and melted in the blink of an eye, no longer able to retain its shape...

<Ooishi>
"...Maebara-san?
 Are you in there?"

<Keiichi>
"............Ah...
 ............yeah."
Ooishi-san lit yet another cigarette.
...There was yet another cigarette butt placed in the ashtray.
...Was it displaying the passage of time?
...Had I... had my thoughts been frozen over for that long...?

<Ooishi>
"I've tried to tell you everything I know.
 ...In return, feel free to tell me anything you want, Maebara-san."

<Keiichi>
"............"
My mind had become... a gigantic, oozing mess.
...My brain felt like it had been totally minced by the blades of a blender...... and I couldn't think.

<Ooishi>
"Now, now, don't clam up again.
 ...If there are any misunderstandings, I'd like to clear them up first.
 ...I don't think you're the culprit here or anything."
Ooishi-san gave his best attempt at an adult smile.

<Ooishi>
"...I know the four of you snuck into the ritual storehouse that night.
 Everyone in the village heard rumors about it by the next day. 

<Ooishi>
...That in itself means we should take you in for trespassing, but that isn't the problem.
 ......It's what was inside.
 ...What was inside that made the people who snuck in there end up as sacrifices?"

<Keiichi>
"............There...
 ......There wasn't anything."
As soon as I said it, I regretted confirming my presence there... but I knew it didn't matter anymore.

<Ooishi>
"...Was there really nothing in there?

<Ooishi>
I mean, everyone who went in is being sacrificed one by one, you know?
 Even the mayor and Rika-san, who switched the lock on the door, were sacrificed. 

<Ooishi>
...What was inside that could have caused such terrible things to happen?"
I was far too tired of keeping quiet about this...
...Perhaps that was Ooishi-san's goal all along... but again, that didn't matter anymore.

<Keiichi>
"...There were just a lot of torture devices that were used a long time ago.
 ...I looked around at them with everyone."

<Ooishi>
"Was that really all?"

<Keiichi>
"...That was really all."
There was nothing... as exaggerated as what Ooishi-san was hoping for, but...
...I felt like in a way, there were plenty of terrible things hidden in there.
From the perspective of someone who viewed the storehouse as sacred... whether or not I thought I had seen some crazy things didn't matter in the slightest.
......The four of us broke the taboo.
 Punish us.
 .........That should have been what happened.

<Ooishi>
"...We put in a request for a search warrant thinking that there might have been some secrets hidden in that storehouse.
 ...Agh, it's been the sabotage of the century. 

<Ooishi>
They said it would be an insult to religious figures, and something about the right to free religion in the constitution...
 Ahh, geez! 

<Ooishi>
...That's why I really didn't have any other recourse but to ask you, since you went in there."

<Keiichi>
"......There really was just... old, rusty, dusty torture equipment.
 ...Nothing else stood out."

<Ooishi>
"...Hmm.
 ......Then Tomitake-san and Takano-san were only killed as a punishment for having broken the taboo?"
...I didn't have an answer for the 'only' part.

<Ooishi>
"...I suppose I won't bother hiding it anymore.
 ...You're the only one to escape harm so far.

<Ooishi>
Everyone but you has disappeared,
 and yet you alone are safe.

<Ooishi>
...What's the difference between you and them that would protect you, but bring harm to the others?
 That's what I want to know."
...There was something wrong with what Ooishi-san was saying.
...You alone...
 You alone.
 ...What...?

<Keiichi>
"Wait... Wait a second.
 What do you mean by... 'you alone'?"

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha.
 ...I'm saying,
 that you alone
 have been left alive, right?

 Out of the four people who tiptoed into the storehouse for ritual implements, I mean."
...The only one left alive?
...Hold on.
 ...Shion was still...

<Ooishi>
"Jirou Tomitake-san and Miyo Takano-san died that night,
 and Shion Sonozaki disappeared the next day.
 ...Only you are still safe and sound at this point.
 ...Why only you?
 I'm saying that's what I want to know."

<Keiichi>
"S-Shion disappeared?!
 That's impossible!!!"
I unintentionally raised my voice...
 ...but I didn't care about that.
Tomitake-san died,
 Takano-san died,

 ...and Shion disappeared?!
When did she disappear...?!?!
What is this guy talking about?!?!

<Ooishi>
"...Oh, well now... I thought you were long since aware of this."

<Keiichi>
"...Th-This is the first I've heard of it!
 Shion disappeared? When?!?"

<Ooishi>
"Well, going back a bit, she disappeared the day after Watanagashi."
...Going back a bit?!
 Stop saying stuff I don't understand...!!

<Ooishi>
"Shion Sonozaki spends the night at relatives' houses depending on her mood on any given day, so no one thought much of not knowing where she was.
 She frequently takes days off from school, too. 

<Ooishi>
Her teacher has been pretty troubled by it."

<Keiichi>
"I didn't ask about any of that!!
 I'm asking you when Shion disappeared!!"

<Ooishi>
"I told you, it was the day after Watanagashi."
...The fluids in my body all reversed direction...
...I lost my sense of balance... and everything I could see started to warp and twist out of shape.
...I simply couldn't endure it...
Hang on,
 hang on.
......Shion had already disappeared...?
Then, then...
<i>That night, that call, that phone call... Who was that...?</i>
She called me every night.
She encouraged me.
...We vowed that we would do our best to live on and not be erased.
...Yes, that should have been a phone call with Shion,
 should have been a phone call with Shion,
 should have been a phone call with Shion...

<Ooishi>
"She took breaks from class like it was nothing, and her family wouldn't listen when the school told them, so they mostly don't bother calling anymore.

<Ooishi>
...So it ended up taking quite a while before we realized she'd disappeared."
I felt a stabbing pain like needles were being pushed into every pore of my body.
...It started on my back... and began spreading throughout the rest of me.
...When it had completely covered the surface of my skin... it began to worm its way inside my stomach as well......

<Ooishi>
"Don't you remember?
 We talked at the library the day after Watanagashi.
 Shion-san was there then.
 ...That was the last we saw of her.
 No one knows where she's been since."

<Keiichi>
".........That's...
 ............That can't be......"
That day, Ooishi-san had only caught me... and Shion bounded away, lying that she needed to go to work.
...Didn't she call me that night...?!

<Ooishi>
"Her job was at a restaurant called Angel Mort, right?
 She hasn't been there since that day.
 ...She's been completely absent ever since. 

<Ooishi>
The person at the restaurant couldn't get in touch with her. He was really worried."

<Keiichi>
"......That can't be...
 .........It can't be..."

<Ooishi>
"It's only circumstantial evidence, but...
 after she left us at the library, but before she made it to work...
 I think it's appropriate to consider her having disappeared during that time."
...Right after Shion...
 ran away without me...?!

<Ooishi>
"It seems that you didn't know.
 ...Maybe if you had said something earlier, this would have gone more quickly.
 Now you understand, right?
 ...You're the only one left. 

<Ooishi>
You're the only survivor of the four who slipped into the ritual storehouse."
......It couldn't be...
 .........It just couldn't be...

<Ooishi>
"If something else happens, it would happen to you.
 I need you to understand that, Maebara-san."
...It can't be,
 it can't be,
 it can't be...
...Shion had already disappeared...?!?!
That couldn't be. It couldn't be.
...I talked to her the day before yesterday.
I talked to her last night.
She was going to call me again today.
That was Shion on the phone—Shion on the phone.
 ...It was from Shion, from Shion.

<Ooishi>
"Shion has long since disappeared.
 ...Next will be you."
Then... who was on the phone those past nights?
Who was on the phone those past nights?
Who was on the phone those past nights...!!?

<Keiichi>
"That's...
 It can't beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
...I lay down on the couch... and stayed there dazed for a while.
My mind was completely blank... I couldn't think about anything for more than a few seconds.
There was a note in my house saying that Mom and Dad would be home late and that I should have some ramen or something for dinner.
I could make it whenever I got hungry... but I had no appetite... so I just stared blankly at the ceiling without eating anything.
The hands of the clock... were already pointing at ten.
...Would I get... another phone call like that today?
...Even though Shion had already disappeared...
...Would she still call me?
Where were they calling from... and who were they...?
The more I thought about it... the more I started to tremble...
I even thought about just disconnecting the phone line.
...If I had been thinking a little less logically, I really would have done it, too.
...Hold on, Keiichi Maebara.
...Ooishi-san admitted it himself, didn't he?
That Shion went missing a lot?
Couldn't she have just gone to relatives that Ooishi-san didn't know about and have been there ever since?
Shion and I were both being targeted by somebody... so it wouldn't be strange to think she went somewhere she usually didn't in order to hide...
...That must have been why Ooishi-san couldn't locate her—and why he labeled her a disappearance.
...Yeah, that had to be it!
 Shion hadn't disappeared at all...!!
Then, my right hand moved of its own volition and slapped me on the cheek.
Its cold sting let me calm down a little...

<Keiichi>
"............Don't just convince yourself of the most convenient possibility, Keiichi Maebara..."
...I knew I didn't want to admit she had disappeared.
...Admitting it... would mean that something terrifying was definitely happening.
...I just needed... to figure out whether Shion was the one on the phone or not.
......Would I ask her if she was actually Shion...?
...That seemed like an incredibly absurd thing to do.

<Keiichi>
"...Still... don't run from this, Keiichi."
If the person on the other end still believed that I thought she was Shion... then that gave me a tiny advantage.
Casually... completely casually...
 ...I would listen to what she had to say...
 and fend
 her off.
 ...I would tear the skin off the monster...
It would definitely be really scary for me...
However... as the last survivor... of the people who went into the storehouse that night... this was my duty to perform.
Still...... then who...... Who would call me and pretend to be Shion......?
I may have only heard her over the phone... but her voice shouldn't be that easy to replicate.
...That was definitely Shion's voice.
 ...It sounded just like her.
 ...It could have only been Shion...
............There was someone, though, wasn't there?
...Someone who sounded just like Shion.
...Mion.
............Mion.
 ......Who else... could have done this............?
At this point... Seriously, after all this time......
...All those little things that didn't quite make sense about Mion until now... overwhelmed my mind...
Like being questioned about sneaking into the ritual storehouse...... and how she shook the ladder while spouting curses.
 ...Who else... who else could have............
Why, though... why would Mion...?
I thought back to the things about the Sonozaki family that I had heard from Ooishi-san and Shion...
...Mion was always entangled in the incidents... in a position where she was omnipotent...
...Some of that information included things that 'Shion' had told me after she disappeared.
 I madly scratched at my head...!
Courage... Give me the courage...
...Just a little bit of courage to pick up the phone—I know it will ring tonight...!
It would be so easy to run away...
That, though... would be the same as making it easy for them to erase me...
I cannot run...
I must stand up and face it...
After all, the next sacrifice...... would definitely be me.
...I was sure 'Shion' would use tricky words to try and trap me.
......Be careful, be careful...
 ...I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared...
 ...I don't want to do this I don't want to do this I don't want to do this I don't want to do this...
............At that point...
 it rang.
The phone rang... and I didn't know where the call was coming from.
...Shion had disappeared.
...Disappeared a long time ago.
...Disappeared the night after Watanagashi.
Yet...
 until today...
 she had been calling me like nothing happened.
...Now again, tonight...
......The people that had disappeared... their corpses simply haven't been found... I really didn't think they were alive.
...So if it really was Shion on the other end...
 then did that mean she was calling me from another world...?
Of course, that couldn't be.
...A living being was calling me, pretending to be Shion.
...Shion was long gone... and yet, as though she were alive and well...
the phone continued its incessant ringing.
I... didn't want to pick up if I didn't have to.
...I had just concluded, though, that not doing so wouldn't solve anything.
Then... what would I do after I answered it...?
Would I immediately declare she wasn't Shion and ask who she was...?
Alternatively, would I pretend I was still fooled... and try to grab her by the tail...?

<Keiichi>
"............That... would probably be the safest thing to do..."
What I was most afraid of was what the person on the phone would do when she realized I knew she wasn't Shion.
...However, as long as I continued to let her think I was fooled, she wouldn't do anything extreme, right...?
If I just make sure to be careful, that should be the safest option......
...I've made up my mind.
...I'll answer the phone.
...Once I do that... I'll talk to her as if nothing happened.
...That wasn't all I'd do this time, though.
...I'd scope her out.
Who was she...
 what was she thinking...
 and what was she after?
...Why was she doing this?
Was she really the one who killed Tomitake-san and Takano-san?
What happened to the mayor?
...What happened to Rika-chan and Satoko...?!
I reached out for the receiver, my arm trembling...
There were too many things I wanted to know... too many things I wanted to ask...
 ...I was scared.
I should start by picking up the phone.
 ...Pick it up, Keiichi.
 Pick it up, Keiichi!!

<Keiichi>
"...H-Hello?"
...Oh, how relieved I would have been if it hadn't been a call from Shion......

<Shion>
"Ah, Kei-chan?
 It's me.
 It's Shion."
My momentary, convenient, and above all fleeting prediction was ripped into a thousand pieces.
...I couldn't help shaking at this point...
 Get ready for this............

<Shion>
"You took a long time to pick up. I thought you weren't home, and I was about to hang up."

<Keiichi>
"Ah... ah, sorry...
 I was just... in the bath."

<Shion>
"...Did your family not pick up for you?
 Could... your parents be out right now, Kei-chan?"
I failed...
I let her in on a fatal piece of information—that I was currently the only one at my house...

<Keiichi>
"Well, no... They're not really...
 A-A-A-Anyway!!
 Have you heard?!
 About Rika-chan and Satoko?"

<Shion>
"No.
 ...What happened after that?
 Were they found?"

<Keiichi>
"............Nah.
 ...They weren't found."

<Shion>
"......Kei-chan, please don't lose hope..."
............
...If... If Ooishi-san hadn't let me know...
...then I might have allowed myself to shed a tear or two at Shion's considerate words.
...Instead, now that it had come to this... I couldn't take her words at face value...
...This person on the other end of the receiver...
 The more perfect a Shion they were...
 the more my blood curdled in fear...

<Keiichi>
"............Rika-chan and Satoko...
 ...They were kidnapped, weren't they..."

<Shion>
"...Yes.
 I don't think there's much doubt..."
......Just how cruel and grave a meaning did those words hold...?
Their weight... astonished me... and then a moment later... I was overcome with numbness and felt like I would pass out.
...I had asked if Rika-chan and Satoko had been kidnapped.
...'Shion,' in turn, had answered that there "wasn't much doubt."
...That cruel meaning... behind her words......

<Keiichi>
"............Rika-chan and Satoko were...
 Ah, no... I mean... I'm sorry.
 ...Umm....... About the mayor...
 ...What do you think happened... after he was kidnapped...?
 Do you think... he's still alive...?"
What happened to Rika-chan and Satoko after they were kidnapped...?
That's what I wanted to ask, but I frantically caught myself.
What if she had given that question... a terrifying response, in such a way to sound like it had nothing to do with her...?
...I was scared of that, so I immediately brought up the mayor.
...That said, however much I talked about the mayor, Ri—

<Shion>
"I think he was killed."

<Keiichi>
"...He
 ......Hey, wait...
 ...That was quick..."

<Shion>
"...I think it must be really hard to kidnap someone and keep them like they are.
 ...As long as they're not hostages, it would be most practical to kill them once you were done with them."
............The world started to bend so much I almost lost my balance.
...The scenery in my eyes whirled around and around like the hands of a clock... and tried to swallow me whole from below.
...I frantically put a hand on the wall to support myself.
...A moment later, a severe nausea welled up within me.
How was she...
 saying such things...
 so lightly...?!?!

<Keiichi>
"K-K-K-Kill them... So readily...
 I-I mean, what's a human life or two, anyway...?!?!"

<Shion>
".........It's a horrible thing, but...
 I think that's probably what happened."
If the mayor was killed... then did that mean the same had happened... to Rika-chan and Satoko...?!?!
...N-No... That couldn't... They weren't some random old man!!
It was Rika-chan!!
It was Satoko!!
Th-They couldn't... They couldn't kill them so readily......!

<Shion>
"It's probably better to think that Rika-chan and Satoko-chan ended up the same way."

<Keiichi>
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!!!!"
Those were the words I wanted to hear the least... and I fought them back with a scream of my own.
...Even though it wouldn't change anything...
 Still...
 I still...
 couldn't help but scream.

<Keiichi>
"Aaahhhh... aahh... ah... ah..."
This time...... the tears flowed.
I'd been confronted with the most horrific outcome... that I'd been trying to avoid considering ever since last night... and I cried.
...There was no longer... any doubt... that it was my fault.
...I killed them.
...I killed Rika-chan and Satoko.
...I... succumbed to the weakness of my own heart... and confessed everything to Rika-chan.
...That's why they were killed.
...That meant I killed them.
...When Rika-chan looked at me with those innocent eyes... if only I hadn't given in!!
I...
 I......
 I......!!!
......Ah... ah... ah............
Even my voice gave out... and yet still... I cried...
 ......................and cried.

<Shion>
"......Kei-chan.
 .........Please, just try and calm down..."
............Rika-chan and Satoko......... They've been killed.
.........We couldn't even find their remains.
...I would never be allowed... to even apologize... to their faces.
.........If that was to be my punishment... then... how brutal a punishment it was...
......I think Shion tried to comfort me... but I didn't hear any of it...

<Shion>
"What are you going to gain by doing that...?!
 They're... definitely going to target you and me next!!
 Please, I'm asking you... get a hold of yourself!!
 ...Please.
 ...Please...!"
Shion was shouting, imploring me with a voice that sounded like tears were in her eyes.
However... I was coming to hate the sound of that voice more and more...
This 'Shion' killed them...
...I had no doubts that this person killed them.
......Why?
 ...Why?!

<Keiichi>
"Why?!
 Why... Why kidnap someone and then kill them...?!?!
 Screw curses! Are people's lives really that cheap?!
 Erasing them and killing them without a second thought like this!!"

<Shion>
"......You're right.
 ...You're absolutely right.
 ...It would take a demon..."
I felt like crushing the receiver in my hand.
...How long... did this person plan on acting like it was someone else's problem...!!
There was magma in the pit of my stomach, and it felt like it was going to erupt at any moment.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Shion.
 ...Please, tell me.
 ...Why did Hinamizawa start needing someone to die on the night of Watanagashi?"

<Shion>
"......That's what I'd like to know."

<Keiichi>
"The fighting over the dam project is already over and done with!!
 ...Haven't enough people been cursed already?!
 Why is it? Why?!?
 If there's a reason, then say it, now!!!"
...I was incoherent at this point.
 ...My emotions had broken through the dam inside of me, rushing forth, and I couldn't stop them.
These were not simple questions—this was an interrogation.
...'Shion' herself hadn't realized it yet... It was just too funny.
...It was so funny... that I couldn't stop crying.

<Shion>
"...I understand how you feel, Kei-chan, I really do.
 ...The dam wars ended a long time ago.
 Yet, murders and disappearances keep happening every year under the guise of Oyashiro-sama's curse.
 ...Why?! 

<Shion>
Why is it happening?!
 Some of them had nothing to do with this, and some of them didn't deserve to be cursed, so why?
 ...Why?!?!"

<Keiichi>
"That's what I'm asking yooouuuuu!!!!"

<Shion>
"I want to know that as much as anyone!!!!"
Hah, hah...!!
 Both our ragged breaths could be heard over the phone.

<Shion>
"Listen.
 ...Oyashiro-sama's curse never existed. It's too unrealistic.

<Shion>
Just like you said, someone in the village is using the grand name of 'Oyashiro-sama's curse' as a justification for continuing these murders and disappearances every Watanagashi!!!

<Shion>
...They were cunning.
 They've been using the curse as a convenient tool, and made a system where they would get rid of two enemies in the village every year...

<Shion>
and this year, that system killed Takano-san and Tomitake-san!!"

<Keiichi>
"Then why wasn't that enough?!
 Why did the mayor and Rika-chan and Satoko have to get killed too?!
 I don't give a shit about the past!!

<Keiichi>
The only thing I care about is why Rika-chan and Satoko needed to be killed!!
 Why is that?!
 I didn't say a word to Satoko, you know!!!
 Why even her...
 Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!?!"
......A silence fell between us.
...Shion didn't answer for a while.

<Shion>
".........Kei-chan,
 ......please
 ......stop being mean...
 ...hic..."
...A sob.
 ...Was Shion crying...?

<Shion>
"............I don't have any idea what's going on either...
 Everything changed... when we went into the ritual storehouse that night......"

<Keiichi>
"............"
...It was the same for me.
......As I listened to Shion's bitter weeping... I could feel my agitation subsiding...

<Shion>
"......When I heard... that Takano-san and Tomitake-san had been killed that night, I doubted my ears.
 ...Then... I realized it instantly.
 ...I realized...
 what sort of a position I was in now...

<Shion>
The four of us snuck in there.
 ...Kei-chan, you and I won't be so conveniently forgiven... 

<Shion>
...When I thought about that, it made my chest so tight... It was so terrifying... You know that feeling, Kei-chan, don't you...?"
............There was nothing fake about her words.
...She'd even understood how I felt.

<Shion>
"...That's why I...
 confessed everything to old man Kimiyoshi...

<Shion>
...All of us entered the forbidden storehouse—it was just a little bit of fun.

<Shion>
...We knew we shouldn't have done it...
 but it really had just been for fun...
 It was only a bit of exploration, that was all......

<Shion>
...Takano-san and Tomitake-san, who went in with us, were killed shortly afterward...
 They met such... miserable ends......

<Shion>
Since that day... I've been living in fear... of when I would be attacked...

<Shion>
...There was nobody except old man Kimiyoshi who would help me...
 ...So I...
 I asked him to save me......

<Shion>
...Old man Kimiyoshi... he wasn't mad.
 ...He smiled, and said, 'if you're really sorry, Shion-chan, then you'd never be demoned away'...
 ...He really did... smile at me...
 and told me... to leave it to him......
 ...*sob*...!!"
Shion... cried bitterly, recalling the beloved mayor's death.
...It was such a sad voice... that none who heard it could prevent it from twisting their hearts...
...A-Again, I... did I let my emotions take over... and go off at her...?
...Shion was in the same situation as me... She should have been my one and only comrade...
...Thump.
My heart pounded.
......My other self... deep within my mind...
 whispered to me.
...Don't forget, Keiichi Maebara.
...Don't forget about the mayor... on the morning after Watanagashi.
He was told of Takano-san and Tomitake-san's deaths over the phone and committed to a meeting that evening.
...He went to a hospital appointment.
He didn't tell his family.
...He'd only made it back just in time for the meeting.
...He went straight to the assembly hall.
 ...That's what Ooishi-san said..........

<Keiichi>
"............When...
 did you let the mayor know...?"

<Shion>
"...Hic...
 ...Huh...?"

<Keiichi>
"............I'm sorry... Shion.
 ......It must seem like I'm kicking you while you're down, but...
 ...Shion, you... told him, right?
 You told old man Kimiyoshi... the mayor?"

<Shion>
"...Yes...
 ........hic..........."

<Keiichi>
"............When... did you let him know?"

<Shion>
"...............Eh..."
...I'd begun to get scared... of saying it aloud after hearing her sad voice.
......I wasn't saying it was contradictory, though...
...Besides, if there was a contradiction...... then I wanted Shion to explain it to me......

<Keiichi>
"...Did you know that the mayor had a severe case of hemorrhoids and had gone to the hospital for treatment...?"

<Shion>
".........Umm.........
 Kei-chan...?
 ...What does that... have to...?"

<Keiichi>
"...Please, answer me.
 If you didn't know, then just say so."
There was a momentary silence.
...Then, after stammering a few times, she replied.

<Shion>
"......I knew that...
 he had hemorrhoids...
 ...It looked like sitting down was really hard for him..."

<Keiichi>
"He was going to the hospital.
 ...You know which hospital, right?"

<Shion>
"............
I'm sorry,
 I don't know that much, but...
 ......Kei-chan...
 What does that have to do with..."
Shion... didn't know what hospital the mayor went to.
...That meant it was impossible for her to have gone all the way to the hospital to confess everything.
...Since she didn't know his destination, then she obviously couldn't have seen him on the train, either.
...If there was any other chance for her to contact him, it would have been after he came to Hinamizawa.
...The train, however, had been delayed, and he only got back right before the meeting was about to start.
...He didn't have time.
...There wouldn't have been enough time for him to listen to Shion spill the beans...

<Keiichi>
"......I want to ask you straight.
 ...Shion... when did you tell the mayor about everything?
 When and where?
 ...Your answer doesn't have to be precise... but please, give me one."

<Shion>
"............Kei-chan... Why are you asking that...
 ...hic..."
Her sob pierced into my ears.
...I was taken by the illusion that I was bullying her...
Even so... I'll say it.
If I'm wrong, then please correct me...
...Please, prove to me... that you're the real Shion.........

<Keiichi>
"...It was impossible.
 ...The day the mayor disappeared.
 From dawn until he vanished.
 ...There was no opportunity for you to contact him."

<Shion>
"............Eh...
 Th......
 That's..."

<Keiichi>
"The mayor left first thing in the morning for his examination at the university hospital all by himself, without telling anyone.
 ...Shion, you just said you don't know what hospital he went to. 

<Keiichi>
...So you couldn't have contacted the mayor until he got back.
 ...Isn't that right...?"

<Shion>
"............Hic..."

<Keiichi>
"His train back was delayed by an accident, and he didn't return to his house until the meeting was about to start.
 ...So there was no time for you to have told him before the meeting started, either."
...I heard Shion... repeating her weak sobs.
...That sort of feminine voice... automatically ripped into my heart......
...It was so... painful for me to say it......

<Keiichi>
"Shion, did you go to the meeting too......?
 Did you attend it... and tell him there?

<Keiichi>
If you didn't...
 then there wouldn't have been any time left.
 The mayor disappeared on his way home."
...Shion went to the meeting, didn't she...?
Did she, or didn't she?
The question was so simple to answer... but she didn't give me an immediate response.

<Shion>
".........Umm......
 Actually, with the meeting, I..."

<Keiichi>
"You didn't even go to the part-time job you said you went to that day.
 ...I'll say it more directly.
 ...You haven't... been seen since we were at the library together."

<Shion>
"............Kei-chan...
 I, well..."

<Keiichi>
"...Shion Sonozaki...
 ...disappeared the day after Watanagashi."
The other end... fell silent as the grave.
...It was so quiet that it was like the phone cord had been cut... I couldn't sense anyone there.

<Keiichi>
"...Ooishi-san says you've been missing.
 ...Despite that... you've been calling me every night like this, haven't you...?"

<Shion>
"......Hic......
 ......hic......
 ...hic...
 ......hic......"
Shion's sobs were torturing me.
...Still... I'm pretty sure I haven't said anything wrong...!

<Keiichi>
"......Please, Shion.
 ...If something I said was wrong... please say so.
 Shion, I'm begging you..."

<Shion>
".........Hic......
 hic......
 hic......"

<Keiichi>
"Shion, there's no way you could have seen the mayor, but...
 if you did see him......"
......If Shion ever did have the chance to meet with the mayor on that day... then that meant...

<Keiichi>
"...then you saw him after the meeting.
 ...In other words!
 ...It could have only been right before he disappeared, or else... afterward!!!!"

<Shion>
"......Hic...... hic......
 ...
 Hu...
 Hee
 hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee"
...Beep...
 beep...
 went the dial tone.
I stood there dazed for a while until I realized she had hung up on me.



[Watanagashi Ch.17]


<Keiichi's mom>
"............Keiichi.
 ...Keiichi...?"

<Keiichi's dad>
"...Just leave him alone.
 ...His friends went missing.
 ...It must be really hard for him."
Normally, my dad never shows me any consideration... but this time he did.

<Keiichi's dad>
"Shouldn't Keiichi stay home from school for a while, too?
 I think it would be safer not to go until the police do something about this."

<Keiichi's mom>
"...Maybe.
 ...Compared to what could happen, taking a few days off wouldn't be a bad idea..."

<Keiichi's dad>
"Anyway, how is it logical not to close school during such a dangerous situation?!
 What do those teachers think our children are?!"
Mom and Dad were getting pretty riled up... but at this point, I couldn't care less.
...Besides, that wasn't the only thing I couldn't care less about.
...The breakfast table, the food in front of me, the time and date, myself... I really had no interest in anything.
This feeling... it was like a dead fog in my mind... It felt like... getting dizzy after taking strong medication.

<Keiichi's dad>
"Keiichi.
 How are your studies going?
 You've gotten further than the other kids, haven't you?
 If you have... then you can take a few days off, all right...?"
............I didn't even feel like answering.
...Today was Thursday.
...Only four days had passed... since the Watanagashi Festival.
Such a short time... and yet now things were completely different.
 ...Everything had changed.
The tranquil village, bright and clear as if it were an Indian summer, had undergone a total reversal...
People were made to disappear every night... and we couldn't even relax when walking out in broad daylight... The village had become a world of fear.
I had no right to curse this outcome.
 ...After all, the one responsible for everything... was me.
That night.
...I couldn't resist my honestly tiny, little, and incredibly stupid curiosity... and broke the taboo.

<Keiichi>
"...This isn't somewhere we should be going, is it?!
 Let's not!
 It's a crime to force your way into a locked building, even if you don't steal anything!! 

<Keiichi>
Shion, now that you know they weren't having some secret rendezvous, you've had enough, right?!
 I don't want to do something like this!
 What if Rika-chan's dance ends while we're messing around here?!"
...I prattled on as I took the lock from Tomitake-san's hands... and put it back on the door.
I'll forget everything I saw here, so come on!
 Let's go, let's go!!
...Takano-san was fretting, but I pushed her away.
 Tomitake-san grinned painfully.
 Shion's shoulders drooped as if to call me an idiot.
 ...Even so, I didn't care.
I pushed everyone farther and farther away.
...Rika-chan's dance was still going on.
...Then, at last, her dance was brought to a close with a roaring applause.
...I, too... until my hands turned red...
 ...I clapped...
 and I clapped...
 ............

...Ding-dong.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Isn't that Rena-chan?
 She's here because it's your usual meet-up time, isn't she?"
I looked up at the clock.
 It was five minutes past my time to meet with Rena.

<Keiichi's dad>
"Keiichi.
 Shouldn't you take a few days off from school?"

<Keiichi>
"............You're right.
 .........Thanks for being so considerate."
I rose from my seat.
...I went to the entrance to greet Rena.

<Rena>
"Good morning.
 ...We're going to school as a group starting today.
 ...So you can't be late."
...Ah... That's right.
...If we, the ones farthest away, were to be late, the younger kids on the way there would be waiting for us.

<Keiichi>
"............Um.
 ...I think I'm going to take some time off.
 ...From school."

<Rena>
"............
 ...Okay."
Rena answered shortly, nodding.

<Rena>
"...I think you should do whatever's best for you, Keiichi-kun.
 ...So, you don't need to feel that you're weak or anything."

<Keiichi>
"............"

<Rena>
"Oh, and...
 Here.
 ...It's a notice they're sending around.
 ...Could you give it to your mom?
 I think it has a lot of important announcements in it."
I took the notice.
...There were a lot more pages than normal.
...The one on top... announced the disappearance of the mayor, Rika-chan, and Satoko, and that they wanted any information about them... It made my heart ache.

<Rena>
"............The police are looking as best they can, too.
 They'll find them for sure.
 Just be patient.
 ...Okay?"
......Rena said, smiling in an attempt to give me courage.
...Rather than that, though... her smile looked like it was because she herself wanted to believe they were safe...

<Keiichi>
".........Rena, you're...
 ...not going to question me?"

<Rena>
"............Nope."

<Keiichi>
"...Rena... you know, don't you?
 ...About that night, what I..."

<Rena>
"Do you mean...
 ...when you snuck into the ritual storehouse?"
...I was speechless for a moment... but then I bit my lip, made up my mind, and nodded a little.

<Keiichi>
"So it's all out in the open...
 ...Really... I shouldn't do bad things like that..."

<Rena>
"...Mii-chan was really mad."
............So she was upset.
......I suppose... she would have been.

<Rena>
"I don't think she was as angry... about you sneaking in there, though...
 as much as about you hiding it from her."

<Keiichi>
"............"

<Rena>
"Maybe, Keiichi-kun... Maybe you should have told her yourself and apologized."
...I should have told her myself... and apologized.
 ...That troubled me.
...Just one week ago...
I did something... that I, myself, should have apologized to Mion for.........
I'd hurt her badly...
However, I hadn't realized that at all.
......Plus, with all the confusion that Shion's appearance had brought... I still hadn't been able to talk to Mion about it......

<Keiichi>
"............Rena... you're right.
 ...I never... I never realize anything...... until you tell me............"

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun.
 .........Hypothetically.
 ...If you had admitted you'd done something wrong right away... and apologized to Mii-chan.
 ......I wonder if Rika-chan and Satoko-chan wouldn't have had to disappear."

<Keiichi>
"............"
I couldn't answer right away.
...I couldn't admit to that......
...Wasn't Rena telling me right now, though...?
...That I... should have admitted to my crime sooner.
...If I had done that, and apologized... Would things not have gone in such a horrible direction...?!
...Rena's eyes were filled with kindness, but they weren't naive enough to forgive me for keeping silent... and they stared fixedly into my own.

<Keiichi>
"............Yeah.
 ...You're right."
...If I had admitted my crime sooner...
 then Rika-chan and Satoko......
 ...wouldn't have had to die or disappear...
...Smack!!!!
The palm of Rena's hand... slapped me in the cheek.
...I stood there unmoving... my head still tilted in the direction I'd been hit.
It didn't... hurt at all.

<Rena>
"I don't... think that anyone has scolded you, Keiichi-kun.
 ...So I'll scold you in their place, okay?"
I pressed a hand to my cheek, now warm with embarrassment... and quietly stared down at Rena's feet...

<Rena>
"Going somewhere you're not allowed to go was a very bad thing to do!!
 ...Do you understand that?!"

<Keiichi>
"...Uh-huh."

<Rena>
"Answer me with a 'yes'...
 Keiichi-kun."

<Keiichi>
"...Yes."

<Rena>
"Also... what's even worse, you didn't admit to having done something so bad!!
 You should never do anything bad in the first place... but not admitting to it or apologizing for it is much, much worse!!!"

<Keiichi>
"............Yes.
 ...I was............ wrong..."
For a few moments... Rena stared at me, silently and intently... as if gauging my remorse.
 ...Then, finally, the tension in her face softened... and she smiled.

<Rena>
"............Okay then... it's about time.
 I should be going."

<Keiichi>
"...All right..."

<Rena>
"Be sure to... give the notice to your mom, okay?
 Also, warn her not to go out to pass it on after it gets dark."
I bent down to pick up the notice, which I'd dropped when she slapped me.
...The pages had come out of the clasp and were now making a mess on the floor. I gathered them up one by one.
...My hands stopped at a single, more lighthearted page, with peaceful sentences dancing on it.
.........We still have plenty of homemade soy sauce in stock.
 Feel free to come to the Sonozaki house if you want some.

<Keiichi>
"............What...
 is this..."
I picked up the page and scanned the rest of it.
...They were stockpiling high-quality soy sauce they got from faraway relatives in the Akita Prefecture.
They had gotten a big shipment recently.
...They couldn't use it all, so they wanted anyone who wanted some of it to feel free to come over...
 is what it said.
As a P.S., it said it arrived in barrels, and to please bring a two-liter bottle or other container for it.
 ...That's how it tied together.

<Keiichi>
".........If you need some soy sauce...
 then you would go to the Sonozaki house.
 ...Rena.
 ...Did you... Did you know all along...?"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 ...I knew."
...Rena... had already been suspicious of Mion... as soon as she noticed that the big bottle of soy sauce was missing.
...Rika-chan had taken the bottle... and gone to Mion's house, and...
 there... she was erased.
Rika-chan wasn't coming back... so Satoko called Mion's house, since she knew where she had gone, and...
 then... Satoko got called there as well...
That meeting on the day the mayor disappeared... Didn't Ooishi-san say...
 that the Three Families participated in it?
...The Three Families would include the Sonozaki family.
...Didn't he also say that the current leader was really old, so her heir, Mion, frequently stood in for her at public appearances?
While the mayor was returning from the shrine...
 Mion called out and stopped him.
...She talked to him, and invited him to their house, and...
 ...then...
 she made him disappear.
It was probably even simpler... to make Shion disappear.
...Shion... was part of the Sonozaki family.
 ...They probably knew exactly what she was doing at all times.
 ...I'm sure they even knew her part-time job schedule, too.
Thinking back... wasn't that Angel Mort store managed by the Sonozaki family?
 ...Setting up an ambush for her there... wouldn't have been any trouble at all...

<Keiichi>
"I'm... I'm going to Mion.
 ...I'll go apologize."

<Rena>
"............"

<Keiichi>
"I'm going to... have her put an end to everything.
 ...Mion probably won't forgive me easily... but I'll go and ask her... not to sacrifice anyone else."
With that decided... there was no need for me to be lazing around here.
I put on my shoes and slipped past Rena to exit the house...
...when she stopped me.

<Rena>
"I'm going too."

<Keiichi>
".........Rena... shouldn't you go to school...?"

<Rena>
"This is way more important than school."

<Keiichi>
"............Rena, you shouldn't come.
 ...If you get wrapped up in this too... then I think I might actually go crazy."
...Rena didn't move her arm, which was blocking my way.

<Rena>
"......If Keiichi-kun disappeared as well...
 then I think I might actually go crazy too.
 ...So I won't let you go alone."
Rena argued boldly... as tears welled up in her eyes...
 I saw them, and I knew the strength of her resolve...

<Keiichi>
"............All right.
 Let's go.
 .........Thank you... Rena."
Rena nodded slightly, but firmly... and finally let down the arm blocking me.
......Let's go...
 to Mion's house.
I'll apologize...
for the crimes I've committed.
...Then, we'll put an end...
to these twisted days.
After that... I'll pray...
...that once more... we can return to those... fun, lively days.
With Rena following me... I left the house.
...In front of the house, there was a car waiting.
 ...It was Ooishi-san.

<Ooishi>
"Hey, good morning.
 Maebara-san.
 To you too, Ryuugu-san.
 Together so early in the morning? You make me jealous. Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu...!"
What a truly praiseworthy man he was, if he had been lying in wait so early in the morning just to pressure me into talking.
 ...On this morning, though, maybe this was actually a good opportunity.

<Rena>
"You're from the police..."

<Ooishi>
"Oh, have I not introduced myself to you, Ryuugu-san?
 Please, excuse my rudeness.
 My name is Ooishi, from the Okinomiya police department.
 Pleased to meet you."

<Keiichi>
"......Are we... telling Ooishi-san?"

<Rena>
"...Yeah.
 ...I think my palm is enough punishment for your crime, Keiichi-kun, but...
 we should leave Mii-chan's to these people."
............Pain and sadness.
 I looked down... as those emotions built up in my heart.

<Rena>
"...We have something to tell you, Ooishi-san."

<Ooishi>
"Well, now.
 What about?
 ...Should we stand here and talk,
 or go inside the car?"

<Rena>
"In the car, please."
...I only continued to look down weakly...
 ...All I could do was be thankful... for how dependable Rena was...
......At Rena's urging, I revealed everything to Ooishi-san.
The latter, while making sure to throw in murmurs that he was paying attention every now and then, took notes.
 ...We continued that way for a while...

<Ooishi>
"............How do you feel?
 Don't you feel a lot better now that you've told me?"
Ooishi-san asked this while scratching his head with his ballpoint pen.
...Of course I don't feel better.
...The price that had been paid up until now for me not owning up to my crimes... had been so immense...
But as long as that payment wasn't returned... the load on my chest could never be removed...
His radio started to emit static.

<Kumagai>
"...Bzz, bzz, this is Kumagai.
 Ooishi-san? Over!"

<Ooishi>
"Yes, hello.
 This is Ooishi."

<Kumagai>
"We got news a few minutes ago that she's been absent from school.
 No movement at the Sonozaki house.
 Our target is still on the premises."

<Ooishi>
"Yes, good. Keep a close watch out."

<Kumagai>
"Roger that.
 The relief for three and seven just arrived, and they've returned to base.
 ...Also, it looks like the division chief is looking for you, Ooishi-san. 

<Kumagai>
He keeps bugging me, too, to tell him as soon as I get in touch with you... What do you want me to do?"

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha-ha...
 If you're hard pressed for an answer, tell him you're actually under orders not to wake me from my morning nap."

<Kumagai>
"Got it."
Bzz! The radio grew silent.

<Ooishi>
"Sorry about that.
 It was about work."

<Keiichi>
"...He just said there was no movement at the Sonozaki house, didn't he?"

<Ooishi>
"Oh, my... Did it sound like that to you?
 This won't do.
 Please, keep that a secret, all right?
 I don't have permission from the division chief to be making private inquiries like this."
...Ooishi-san... had suspected Mion for a long time.

<Ooishi>
"...Nor for questioning witnesses, or for searching houses... We don't have permission for anything, really.
 The Sonozaki house's defenses said to protect the family members are also in full working condition. 

<Ooishi>
Without a warrant, we can't do anything about anything, unless the crime happens right in front of us. Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"

<Rena>
".........Ooishi-san...
 Could you be..."
Rena's tone of voice alone was enough to make her spite clear as she stared at Ooishi-san.

<Rena>
"You can't set foot in the Sonozaki house.
 ...Were you trying to get Keiichi-kun to go in there instead?"

<Keiichi>
"...Rena, that's... What do you mean...?"

<Rena>
"This person... Just as I thought, he plays really dirty."

<Ooishi>
"......Stop, you're hurting my reputation.
 That said, I'm all ears to your explanation, okay?"
Ooishi-san lit a cigarette and responded to Rena, wearing an expression implying he was calm and willing to let her comment slide.

<Rena>
"You can't get a warrant, but you've always had your eyes on Mii-chan because you thought she was suspicious."

<Ooishi>
".........Hmm, yes?"

<Rena>
"...You plotted to incite Keiichi-kun and have him go to the Sonozaki house.
 ...Then, if something were to happen to him, you would have used that as an excuse to go in.
 ...Isn't that right?"
............I only understood about half of what Rena was saying...
...I knew, however, that Ooishi-san had been trying to use me.

<Rena>
"...Even if Keiichi-kun got hurt as a result.
 ...Have you no shame?!
 Is this how the police do things?!"

<Ooishi>
".........My, my.
 ...It seems we have an incredible detective on our hands.
 ...Oh my, oh my.
 ...Would you be interested in taking our exam? 

<Ooishi>
I'd gladly write a recommendation letter to get you into the detective division. Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu...!!"

<Rena>
"You're despicable."
Rena spoke quietly, her words dripping with hostility.

<Ooishi>
"...I've been insulted in all kinds of ways in my life, but one or two words from a young girl is always the roughest for me."

<Rena>
"Even so... I suppose I should thank you for not arresting Mii-chan yet."

<Ooishi>
"Don't mention it."
Ooishi-san seemed to be enjoying his exchange with Rena.
...The things this man thought were like a swamp... I could barely see past the surface.
...It reminded me again... of how much I disliked him.

<Ooishi>
"......Now then.
 As two esteemed friends of Mion Sonozaki-san, what do you plan on doing now?
 Will you wait kindly for me to go over the evidence and request a warrant?"

<Rena>
"No.
 We won't wait for that.
 ...We'll go... and make Mii-chan surrender herself."
...That's right.
...If she turned herself in rather than be arrested, she might get a lighter sentence...
At this point, perhaps that was... the only pity I could find in me to afford her.

<Ooishi>
"I see, I see. I wonder if it will go that well.
 ...If you're careless, you two may face danger, you know."
...Ooishi-san was measuring our resolve.
 ...So, in a strong voice, I declared:

<Keiichi>
"We're... fully prepared!"
...Ooishi-san gave us an unpleasant, yet seemingly satisfied grin.
...It was then that I realized this man was trying to use us for his own convenience.

<Rena>
"If anything should happen to us, use that as an excuse.
 ...Though my greatest hope is that you will surround the place so that the criminal can't get away."

<Ooishi>
"...Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!
 Ryuugu-san, you're good at negotiating, too.
 I'm throwing in the towel.
 I surrender."

<Keiichi>
"......Wh-What are you talking about...?"

<Rena>
"If the policemen surround Mii-chan's house...
 ......Then that will be insurance for the worst-case scenario.
 ...For the worst case."
Plus, it would be another way of pressuring Mion to give herself up, wouldn't it...?

<Ooishi>
"Ahh... Ooishi to Kuma-chan.
 Ooishi to Kuma-chan."

<Kumagai>
"Bzz ...bz, this is Kumagai.
 Go ahead."

<Ooishi>
"Our two friends are going to play at the Sonozaki house.
 ...Make arrangements so that we can reinforce them if needed."

<Kumagai>
"Roger! Zzz!"
...Their altogether too-short conversation... implied that our questioning was already a part of their plans.

<Ooishi>
"Then... let's get going.
 Want to buy some tea biscuits on the way there?"
Neither Rena nor I went along with Ooishi-san's stupid joke.



[Watanagashi Ch.18]

Ooishi stopped the car at the place where we always waited for Mion.
Come to think of it... I've never been to Mion's house before.
...I've only heard that it's right down this road.

<Ooishi>
"...This is as far as I can take you.
 According to our information, there are quite a few security cameras set up on the premises.

<Ooishi>
Still, don't worry.
 I've got a bunch of youngsters ready and waiting to slip past them and go in.
 We'll be monitoring the inside with a one-way mic, so if you two give a loud scream, we'll know right away."

<Rena>
"...We'll persuade her for sure, so please be ready for her to turn herself in."
...In both our eyes... was determination.
 ...It was the only method available to us for lightening the sins of our good friend.

<Ooishi>
"Be plenty careful, you hear?
 You probably don't believe it right now... but I don't want you two being sacrificed if at all possible."

<Keiichi>
"......You're right about that."
With that rude response, we left the car.
The clinging humidity and voices of the cicadas greeted us.
...I'd never have expected this would be happening today.

<Rena>
"...Let's go,
 Keiichi-kun."
Rena took the lead and began to walk...
 down the road I'd never been.

<Keiichi>
"Rena... You've been to Mion's house before, right?"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 A few times.
 ...It's a really big house.
 You could fit a mountain into their backyard, too.
 ...You can pick mushrooms and stuff, though there are fences everywhere."
......Big enough to fit a mountain... That was amazing.
One of the Three Families controlling Hinamizawa... and the head family of the Sonozaki clan.
 ...Perhaps there was something to be said about its magnitude.
The path continued onward, level and uneventful.
There were metal fences along its edges, and beyond them were woods with trees growing thickly.
The fences were high.
...The tops of them bent inwards, sticking out like sharp spears.
 Plus, there was dangerous-looking barbed wire wrapping them.
...No one could look at them and not feel intimidated.
In addition, there were signboards hung up here and there along the fence.
'Private property of the Sonozaki family! Entrance forbidden!'
'Beware of venomous snakes!'
'Active security cameras.
Intruders will be charged an entry fee of 1,000,000 yen.'

<Keiichi>
"...This forest... or should I say, mountain...
 ...Is this all their yard?"

<Rena>
"It's more like... their domain.
 As you can see, it's private property, but nobody maintains it.
 The forest isn't really the kind that you can go hiking in..."
She could say that again.
 It really did feel like a neglected, savage woodland.
It was dark and damp... and certainly not a forest that made you want to go for a nice walk.
...Maybe that's just what happens when a landowner has too much land.
Like Ooishi-san said, there were security cameras hung up all over the place.
...Though they had been weathered by wind and rain, casting doubt as to whether they were even functional.

<Keiichi>
"...I wonder if Mion is watching us... as we come to her."

<Rena>
"I don't think she is.
 ...The only people living in Mii-chan's house are generally her and her grandma, after all.
 There's nobody to watch the cameras."
...What a useless security system.

<Rena>
".........Well, Mii-chan's father... seems like a pretty tough person to get along with.
 So whenever everyone in the family is getting together, the cameras are apparently working properly."
...That's right.
 Mion's father... He was a big-shot yakuza, wasn't he?
Rena smoothly danced around the answer as she explained.
At last... a huge gate, as big as I'd imagined, appeared.
Was she living by herself with her grandmother... in a house with such a grand gateway...?

<Keiichi>
"...I wonder if she's here."
Beeeeeeep.
The old buzzer made a dull sound.
...Was it cut off in the middle and not getting to the house...?
We waited long enough without a response for me to start thinking like that.
....However, we finally heard footsteps walking through gravel on the other side of the gate.
...I nervously... balled my hands, my palms now sweating, into fists.
There was the clang of a bolt being released, and the gate opened slightly.
...The person peeking out of the gap... was none other... than Mion.

<Mion>
"...Well, this is unusual.
 ...Aren't you two going to school?"
Mion didn't seem all that surprised at visitors arriving in the morning, which wasn't a normal time.
 ...In fact, she almost seemed relaxed, as if she knew we were coming beforehand.

<Rena>
"...We... stayed home today."

<Mion>
"...Hmm.
 ...Kei-chan is one thing, but you too, Rena?
 ...You two are such troublemakers."
Mion... smiled lightly... in the way that the Mion we knew always did.

<Mion>
".........Well, let's not just stand here.
 Come on in."
She gestured for us to follow her.
 ...I hesitated for a moment, looking at Rena.

<Rena>
"Let's go."
Rena smiled cheerfully, as if she were passing through the gate of a good friend's house, and then did just that.
...I rally myself and then go through the gate too.
On the other side... It hadn't been maintained very well, but it was clear that the lot was magnificently wide.
...It wasn't quite what you'd think of when you hear 'mansion'... but it was very clearly a vast place.

<Mion>
"Was this the first time you've been here, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah... yeah.
 ...This house is enormous..."

<Mion>
"Steep thatched roofs aren't in fashion anymore.
 This place could be a tourist attraction.
 I want to rebuild it using totally average and boring reinforced concrete soon."
Mion drily smiled as she said that, then closed the gate and re-locked the heavy bolt.

<Mion>
"Don't worry about it.
 Things have been dangerous lately.
 Gotta do at least this much during the daytime."

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah... You're right..."
Maybe it was my imagination, but I thought I saw the hint of a shadow in her smile.

<Mion>
"Well then, good sir and madam, I shall show you inside.
 ...Please, come this way."
Mion bowed to us like a worker at a high-class hotel, then pivoted on her heel and began to walk.
Rena gripped my stiffening arm lightly.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun, you're too tense.
 ...We came to see Mii-chan, remember?
 You don't need to be that nervous."
...That's right.
When I get nervous, I tend to let everything show on my face.
...I'll stop tensing up.
...Even if something were to happen, there were two of us.
 ...Ooishi-san's subordinates were waiting outside the gate for us, too.
 ...There was nothing to worry about...
After thinking about it that much, I realized my nervousness was already gone, and laughed at myself.

<Keiichi>
"What's this?
 ...Mion, what's with this stone on top of the newspapers?
 It's in the way."
There was a pile of newspapers on the floor of the entrance, and there was a large rock on top of them.
...I didn't understand why something like that was here.
...Rena noticed me looking at it questioningly and giggled.

<Keiichi>
"Rena, do you know?
 What is this?
 Some kind of good luck charm?"

<Mion>
"Ahahaha!
 If you don't really know, then feel free to move it out of the way and put your shoes there.
 Ah-hahahahahaha!"

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, there's a nest of swallows right above that stone."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 Oh... You're right."

<Mion>
"This house is for people, but swallows still come in without permission and make nests.
 It must be like a tradition for them—whenever spring comes, they always make a nest here.
 It's kind of annoying, though."

<Rena>
"In other words, it's a sign to not take off your shoes here, because swallow poop could end up in them."
...I couldn't help but laugh at the silly contrivance.
 My laughter naturally spread to the other two.

<Mion>
"A really long time ago, the Sonozaki family apparently cultivated silkworms.
 Our ancestors would get all worked up over exterminating the swallows. 

<Mion>
...When you think of it that way, maybe this is our just desserts.
 Ahahahaha!
 Anyway, come on in."
The inside of the house wasn't very bright at all.
...It was dimly lit, in fact, but mysteriously, I could still feel an elegance to the place.
...Mion seemed to want a more modern building... but traditional houses like this aren't bad, either...

<Mion>
"You're kidding, right?
 There's a terrible draft, and the winters are freezing!
 Don't go making my house into property of cultural significance and getting in the way of renovations, got it? 

<Mion>
...What I want most is a house like yours, Kei-chan.
 I'm pretty jealous of it.
 It seems like it would be warm in the winter.
 Oh, but snowfall seems like it would be a problem~"

<Keiichi>
"Snowfall's a problem?
 ...Does Hinamizawa get that much snow?
 ...Our latitude is south of Kanto, isn't it? Isn't this region warm?"

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha, you don't know, Keiichi-kun?
 Hinamizawa is in an area that gets heavy snowfalls.
 When we get a lot, everyone gets buried.
 Sometimes you can't even get out of your house."

<Rena>
"Sometimes your car gets totally buried too, and you can't find where it is."
I-I wasn't aware of that!
Hinamizawa... was that bad a place in the winter?!?!
Come to think of it, my dad...
He said something like... this place got plenty of snow, so we could have fun building igloos.
 ...Still, your front door getting buried? Not being able to find your car??
 That's way too much snow!!!

<Mion>
"Ah-hahahaha.
 You remember from geography class, right?
 The western side of Japan gets cold winds from Asia.
 We're different from those softies protected by the mountains, nice and warm by the Pacific Ocean!"

<Keiichi>
"I'm... totally okay with being a softie, and nice and warm.
 I hate the cold~~!!"

<Mion>
"Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
 We'll have to have a training camp to get Kei-chan used to the cold this winter, then!"

<Keiichi>
"No way, no way, there's no way that's happening!!
 I hate the cold, and I hate training camps too, and I hate them even more put together!!!"
Mion laughed more uproariously than she ever had, then told us she'd bring out some tea and left her seat for the moment.

<Rena>
"Still,
 there's a lot of fun things to do in the winter!
 I bet our club will be a blast then!"

<Keiichi>
"...Our club continuing activities through the winter sounds totally horrible...
 ...Like swimming in the cold, or marching in the snow!
 When did we turn into Mt. Redhorn?!?!"

<Rena>
"...Yeah. There are definitely a lot of tough punishment games for the winter season...
 One time she made us have a Rio Carnival in the schoolyard while snow was falling!"
...I see the terror of our club cared not for the season...
...The victor would be decided by who could best adapt to the winter-only events...

<Rena>
"We do snowball fights, and shaved ice eating contests, and treasure hunts in the snow..."

<Keiichi>
"...Wait, why is everything outside?
 Why can't we play tabletop games in a nice, warm room while it's snowing?!"

<Rena>
"Whoa, Keiichi-kun, if you're saying things like that, then you're gonna lose a lot this winter.
 ...We'll have lots of punishment games, and Rena won't lose. ...Hau!"

<Keiichi>
"Don't give me that 'hau'!!!!"
I settled things with a cross chop to the head.

<Mion>
"Ahahahaha! You're sure having fun.
 Our walls aren't very thick, so be careful not to go flying through any, okay?"
The paper sliding door opened and Mion returned with a pot and a complete tea set.

<Mion>
"Do you want some sesame senbei to go with that?
 Sorry we don't have much in the way of bean paste or other good stuff."

<Keiichi>
"It's okay, it's okay.
 We didn't really come here to drink tea anyway..."

And with those words, the smile disappeared from Rena's face.
.........Ah, ...she did it...
...That one careless statement... reminded us of what we had nearly been able to forget.
...I had wanted to enjoy this peaceful time for a little longer... but we put an end to that with those honestly careless words.
When she noticed the smile disappear from Rena's expression, Mion, too... changed hers.
...It was as if the cheerful air... that was like a warm spring day until a moment ago... had slipped through the cracks in the paper door...
 and altogether disappeared.
...There was no point... in regretting it now.
...We did not come here today... to chat and enjoy ourselves.
Mion silently poured the tea.
...During that time, both Rena and I sat kneeling without uttering a word.

<Mion>
"Here you are.
 Drink up."
We couldn't even mutter a word of acknowledgement at those natural words of courtesy...

<Mion>
"............There's no poison in it or anything.
 ......Do you distrust me that much?
 That's upsetting."
Mion gave a bitter smile at that and let her shoulders droop.

<Rena>
"............"

<Mion>
"............"

<Keiichi>
"............"
We all remained silent.
 ...We remained silent... hoping that someone else would speak up first.
That was, however, the one thing we didn't want to do... and so we sat for a long time.
At last, Mion smiled scornfully and opened her mouth to speak.

<Mion>
"...Hey, now, Kei-chan, Rena.
 You're the guests.
 Didn't you come here for something?
 If you don't speak up first, this old man won't know what to do."
Rena and I exchanged glances...
 ...and we both resigned ourselves.
...Rena opened her mouth to speak first, so I stopped her.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun..."

<Keiichi>
"It's okay.
 ......I needed to come here.
 ...Let me talk first."

<Rena>
"............Okay.
 I understand..."

<Mion>
"What would Kei-chan have... to tell me?
 'Please give me your daughter's hand in marriage,' maybe?
 Ah-hahahaha!
 Can't do that!
 My little Rena and Kei-chan aren't meant for each other~! 

<Mion>
Go wash your face with miso soup and try again later~!!"
...Afterwards, I thought her mean remarks were Mion's own way of showing consideration.
...Mion had said those mean things in a totally normal voice... and it drained the tension from my shoulders...

<Keiichi>
"............Mion.
 ...First.........
 I have something to apologize for."

<Mion>
"............You do?
 ...What for?"
Mion pretended that she didn't know what I was talking about, but I'd clearly gotten my point across...

<Keiichi>
"...Well, on the night of Watanagashi.
 ......The... ritual storehouse behind the shrine...
 I went in there."

<Mion>
"............"
I could see Mion's expression immediately become harder.

<Keiichi>
"............I knew it was somewhere I wasn't supposed to go, but...
 it was just supposed to be a little bit of exploration... We didn't mean anything by it.
 ...Even so... I still shouldn't have done it... 

<Keiichi>
......So I apologize.
 ...I'm sorry..."
To display my deepest sincerity... I pressed my forehead to the table.
 ...I'd meant it as my way of prostrating myself.
...I figured it wouldn't feel sincere enough if I raised my head right away... so I left it there on the table for a while.
Mion didn't say anything.
...With my face down, I couldn't tell what sort of expression Mion had.
......Only the voices of the cicadas filled the room.
...Mixed with them, I could hear the sound of the clock ticking.
 ...That was all.
When I started to struggle to breathe from having my head down for so long, Mion told me to stop.

<Mion>
"...You got me there.
 ...I didn't expect you to pitch it to me straight.
 ...You've got me on the ropes."
I looked up to see that Mion's face was calm, but she was smiling faintly.

<Mion>
"...If you understand that even though it was only a casual exploration for you, Kei-chan... that there are a lot of people who think it's no laughing matter...
 ...then it's okay. 

<Mion>
There's an old saying... when in Rome, do as the Romans do."

<Keiichi>
 "......It's been... days since then.
 ...It may be too late, but I apologize.
 ...What I did was wrong.
 ...Please, forgive me........."
...I could feel pitiful tears welling up within me.
...If I had done this sooner... maybe nothing terrible would have happened......

<Mion>
"......It's okay.
 If you know what you did was bad, then that's enough, right?"
Mion spoke like it was someone else's problem, and I wasn't happy about it.

<Rena>
"...Mii-chan.
 Keiichi-kun is apologizing seriously.
 ...I think maybe you should respond seriously as well... as well."

<Mion>
"...I am being serious, though.
 Do I not look serious to you, Rena?"

<Rena>
"You don't."
Rena was giving her tit for tat... and so the room's atmosphere quickly began to grow sharper.
She was right—even though I came here to speak from the heart like this... it's felt like she hasn't been taking this seriously.
...Obviously, Rena isn't fond of that.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun.
 You can get up now.
 Let's tell her everything.
 ...That looks like what Mii-chan wants, too."

<Keiichi>
"............"
I had known... it would turn out like this from the beginning.
...Hadn't I come here prepared for that...?
 ...I mustered my willpower and bit my lip.

<Keiichi>
"......Mion.
 ...You called Rika-chan and Satoko the day before last, right?"

<Mion>
"............I don't remember doing so.
 If you have a reason to think so, could you let me hear it...?"

<Rena>
"It was evening, before dinnertime.
 ...Rika-chan should have come here.
 Bringing a big bottle of soy sauce.
 To have you share some with her."
Mion was trying to keep from showing any reaction... but I didn't miss her eyelid twitching just a little bit.

<Mion>
"............Why do you think that?"

<Rena>
"...It's not hard to understand.
 Mii-chan, you saw it too, didn't you?
 Rika-chan's room."
Mion put a finger to her forehead and acted like she was thinking.

<Rena>
"...There was chilled tofu, but no soy sauce.
 Plus, the big bottle of soy sauce that should have been under the sink was nowhere to be found."

<Mion>
"......Ahahahahaha.
 What?
 Is that why she would have come here?"

<Keiichi>
"Mion, drop the act.
 ...You wrote it yourself on the notice, didn't you?
 That you'd share your soy sauce?"
...Mion scratched her head.
I heard her ever-so-faintly click her tongue.
It was as though... we found out she'd purposely given too little change to a servant...
 That's all I could feel from her.

<Rena>
"...Then, Mii-chan, you...
 Rika-chan......
 You era............
 you hid her."
Rena hesitated for a moment.
...I could tell that she didn't want to use the word 'erased'... and that she was struggling to find another word...

<Rena>
"......That was really supposed to be the end, wasn't it?
 ...For you, anyway."

<Mion>
"......What are you talking about?"

<Rena>
"...You didn't foresee that Rika-chan would tell Satoko-chan that she was going to your house, did you, Mii-chan?"

<Mion>
"............"

<Rena>
"Then... Satoko-chan called.
 ...'Might Rika be imposing on you?'
 ...Yeah.
 Probably just like that."

<Mion>
"............Ahahahaha!
 You sound just like her."

<Rena>
"......Mii-chan... you were in a bit of a bind then,
 because someone knew that Rika-chan had come here.
 ...So you decided to lure Satoko-chan here too."

<Mion>
"...Lure her out?
 ......Hmm.
 ...Like how, I wonder?"
Mion prodded Rena on, as if trying to get to the good part of an interesting story.
...I, however, knew. I had been watching Mion change the whole time.
She was restlessly twirling her fingers...  she had clearly lost her calm.
...Of course, it was really a slight thing... and only I, who had been watching her this whole time, would have known.
Mion was... panicking.
...What Rena was saying... must have been... a bullseye.

<Rena>
"It probably went like this.
 ...'Satoko.
 I actually made too much dinner today, so why not come over and eat?
 Rika-chan came earlier and already ate some.'
 ......Something like that."
Scratch.
......Mion's nails dug into her knee.

<Mion>
"......Hehh...
 ......There's no recordings of the phone conversations or anything, so how do you know that much...?"

<Rena>
"...I know it because the dinner that Satoko-chan made for the two of them was plastic wrapped in their refrigerator, and hadn't been touched."
......For a few moments, Mion's face was frozen in utter amazement.
...She looked like she couldn't believe... that this person in front of her was Rena.

<Mion>
"............With just that to go on...... How did you even guess what we said over the phone...?"

<Rena>
"......It's a long explanation, so I'll get to the point.
 ...The contents of that refrigerator... provided a vivid account of what you said over the phone when you lured her out."
Mion's jaw remained on the floor...
That was the only way I could describe her face...

<Mion>
"............That's...
 Ahahahahaha.
 ...I had no idea I had such an incredible detective right next to me the whole time. 

<Mion>
...I can't believe you'd figure out everything, down to the phone conversation... just from what was inside the fridge...
 ......Ahahahahahahaha. 

<Mion>
...You've got me there.
 ...You've got me,
 you've got me,
 ah-hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"
...As if a dam had burst... Mion convulsed into laughter.
...Her laughter, though, definitely didn't make us want to laugh as well.

<Mion>
"Hahahahahahahahahahaha... haha, ...ha.
 ...Hah."
Mion grew tired of her dumb laughter, heaved a big sigh, and scratched her head.
...It almost seemed like... Mion had lost a detective punishment game for the club or something... and her punishment had been decided.
...Oh, how fun that would have been if it were true...

<Rena>
"...An incredible detective...
 ...Mii-chan, you're the one who guessed what Ooishi-san told us.
 He called me an incredible detective too."

<Mion>
"............"
As soon as she heard Ooishi-san's name, Mion's eyes began to display panic more clearly, so that anyone would be able to tell.

<Keiichi>
"...Mion.
 ......The police have suspected you for a long time now.
 ...Ooishi-san's officers have had the house under observation so that they could break in at any time."
Mion attempted to feign calm... but it looked like she was having a hard time with that.
Part of her couldn't believe that the police had her surrounded, and she closely examined Rena's facial expression.
However, she couldn't detect a hint of falsehood.
...Finally, Mion seemed to accept the fact that the police were encircling the house...

<Rena>
"Was the mayor... Mii-chan too...?"

<Keiichi>
"Were Tomitake-san and Takano-san... you as well...?"
Mion didn't answer our rapid-fire questions.
...I could clearly see impatience in her eyes, which were still feigning calm.
At last... Mion, who had been sitting there lazily, readjusted her cushion and sat herself upright...
At that moment... the atmosphere in the room changed completely.
......Mion's expression... also changed.
The impatience and wonderment in her expression disappeared...... and she became so solemn you would think she was about to conduct a tea ceremony.
...I could sense it.
...It was now, in this moment.
...Mion had ceased to be Mion... but had changed into Mion Sonozaki, the current heir to the Sonozaki house.
That solemn atmosphere about her... was clearly abnormal...
 and was entirely different from that of the Mion that I knew.
Now... I could believe it.
...Now... I could believe...
 that she was the young leader who commanded the entire Sonozaki clan.
...Mion quietly placed both her hands on the tatami mat...
 and gave a beautifully elegant bow, as if this really were a tea ceremony...
 and named herself.

<Mion>
"...We meet for the first time.
 ...I am the current heir to the Sonozaki house.
 ...My name is Mion."
...Mion's movements were so elegant they could cut...
 and we couldn't even answer her.
All Rena and I could do... was watch, baffled at her actions, which we could never imagine the normal her doing...

<Mion>
"...I would like to welcome you to the Sonozaki main house today.
 I will greet you all in place of our leader, Oryou...

<Mion>
...It seems as though you have various things you would like to ask...
 If I can be of any assistance, then I would like to answer, without concealing anything..."
What?
 ...What did... Mion just say...?
...Mion said she would answer anything we asked.
...There was a strong light of resolve in her eyes.

<Keiichi>
"............It's really......
 all right if we ask anything, then...?"

<Mion>
"...I shall tell you everything I know...
 That is why you have come here, after all."
Rena and I exchanged glances.
...There was a mountain of things we wanted to ask Mion.
However, we hesitated for a moment... on what we should ask first.
...The first question Rena gave...
 was extremely abstract......
 but it was the question everyone wanted to know right now.

<Rena>
"...Why............
 would you do this...?!?!"
...That was what I wanted to ask as well.
 ...Why... would you do this?!
That didn't only go for Rika-chan and Satoko.
...It went for the mayor, Takano-san, and Tomitake-san as well.
...No, even further back—for all the incidents that had been occurring every year.
...For a little while, Mion couldn't respond.
...Right when we realized that the question was too vague and tried to put it into more concrete terms...
she finally opened her mouth to speak.

<Mion>
"To answer that question... will take some time...
 ...If that is acceptable, however, then I would by all means like you to hear it..."
...She spoke clearly.
...She spoke with a clarity... that a grandmother might use when telling a story from a long time ago.

<Mion>
"...Do you know that Hinamizawa Village used to be called Onigafuchi Village?"
Rena nodded lightly, then shot me a glance asking me if I did.
 ...I returned her nod.
...Hinamizawa was once called Onigafuchi Village... Yes.
 I heard all about it that night from Takano-san in the ritual storehouse.
They firmly believed that demon blood ran through their veins, and cut off all contact with the outside world.
...They were worshipped by those in the villages at the foot of the mountains... and treated like 'transcendents,' those capable of magic.

<Mion>
"...That's right.
 Our ancestors in Onigafuchi Village... were proud transcendents descended from the demons.
 ...Those in the villages at the foot of the mountains worshipped and honored them. 

<Mion>
...Nevertheless, that all decayed with the end of the Tokugawa era."
The black ships arrived,
 the era of the samurai ended,
 the era of national isolation ended...
 and the tradition of worshipping Onigafuchi Village quickly disappeared.
...Those things that linger from the past were all to be detested.
 ...That was the kind of era it became...

<Mion>
"The Meiji era began, and the name of Onigafuchi Village, with its long history, was forcibly changed to Hinamizawa Village.
 ...I have heard the Meiji government strongly wished to erase the old customs..."
The abolition of feudal domains, and the establishment of prefectures.
...An era had begun, seeing Japan sprinting up the stairs that were beyond their means to try and reach the same level of the rest of the world.
All things in the Western style were to be extolled... while all old traditional things were to be scorned.
 ...That was the sort of era it was.

<Mion>
"Our ancestors in Onigafuchi Village... were proud transcendents descended from the demons.
 Onigafuchi Village disappeared in a flash..."
At last, Japan, provoked by the great European powers colonizing countries in Asia one by one, began a policy to increase its wealth and military power so that it could stand as a global power in its own right...
Conscription began, and they won war after war—the First Sino-Japanese War, and the Russo-Japanese War... and until the Pacific War broke out...
 they recklessly climbed the staircase towards modernization...
...Thus began harsh days where one would suffer unreasonable discrimination just because people knew one was from Onigafuchi.
The children in the village at the foot of the mountain were taught not to go near Hinamizawa because filthy germs were rampant there.
...Children who had come into contact with children in Hinamizawa would cry and wail as their parents purified the spot they were touched by rubbing salt on it.
One of the adults said to the children... that if you got lost in Hinamizawa, you would be kidnapped by demons, cut up into pieces, and devoured.
...Never, ever go near the terrifying village of the man-eating demons...
 That's what he taught them.
Another... said that during a famine long ago, 
the people of Hinamizawa gathered up all the corpses they discarded into the dry riverbeds, then cooked and ate them in order to survive—groundless stories, but said in such seriousness.
Baseless slander added to baseless slander, making Onigafuchi Village's historically accurate, thrilling history all the more believable.
Perhaps the chain of undue discrimination was a manifestation of the people's anxiety towards the uncertain times.
...Of course, the story didn't end only with the perspective of children.
If anyone found out you were from Onigafuchi, you would be turned down from any job you applied for.
...People would even go back on engagements and marriage proposals.
...As for the marriages where one partner had lied about it—as soon as the truth got out, they were made to divorce.

<Rena>
"............That's...
 terrible."
......I've heard about such discrimination towards those in small villages in civics class.
...Just because others knew you were from a tiny hamlet, you would be subjected to every societal disadvantage there was—a modern form of bullying.
...Though I only memorized that because it was going to be on a test one time.
...I recalled being suspicious about it, and unable to believe such discrimination occurred in modern Japan...

<Mion>
"......Well... I suppose I can't say that they weren't asking for it... 

<Mion>
...Our ancestors were proud of the demon blood flowing through them—they lived their lives boasting about it and scorning those at the foot of the mountain, after all... 

<Mion>
They struck fear into the villagers down there with their mystique, and demanded gifts of dread and tribute..."
With that, Mion smiled for the first time, albeit in self-mockery...

<Mion>
...They would send their husbands and sons to war... and the women on the home front would suffer greatly, too...

<Mion>
...My grandmother remembers it well... She remembers it being a difficult time..."
Even that bitterly long war, however...
 finally ended in 1945.

<Mion>
"...Hinamizawa had lost many male hands, but at last, their fathers and husbands and sons returned to them.
 ...Of course, there were also many who didn't come back. 

<Mion>
Nevertheless, for those in Hinamizawa, who were at their limits, barely able to maintain the village without the men, their return was a very happy thing..."
MacArthur's GHQ set to work on drastically improving mindsets, and strove for the abolition of unfair discrimination.
They could feel day breaking on the dismal night that was the previous era...

<Mion>
"...Hinamizawa was on the verge of turning into a ghost town.
 Those in the village started to say that they should rebuild it once again, and got to work, trying to make the village even a little more plentiful."
...During that time, someone appeared who built up a fortune through a vast number of dealings in the black market.
That was Mion's grandfather.
 The husband of the elderly current family leader—Sohei Sonozaki.

<Mion>
...He hid them somewhere in the Seto Inland Sea and sold them widely at a high price on the black market, thus earning a fortune."
Sohei didn't spend that fortune for his own pleasure, either.
He entrusted the entire amount to his wife, the head of the Sonozaki house.

<Mion>
"...Let's revive this ruined village.
 All who live here are our family, and this fortune is our collective property...
 So he proclaimed to my grandmother, the current head of the family. 

<Mion>
...That vast fortune was a huge reason why Hinamizawa was revitalized after the war."
.........I see.
 With that, Hinamizawa came back to life, and that's how the Sonozaki family had established its current prosperity...

<Mion>
"...Of course, there were many people who begrudged the money coming from the black market, but the villagers no longer minded it..."
They succeeded at one business venture after another.
 Those who had succeeded freely supported those who followed them.
The giant family of Hinamizawa, tied together with strong bonds, kept on expanding its influence.
The Sonozaki family, the center of everything, would be extolled for a long time as the minds behind Hinamizawa's revitalization...

<Rena>
"...The person at the middle of all of it was your Nana, Mii-chan?
 ...That's amazing.
 What a great success!"
Mion looked like she was honestly happy Rena had praised her...
...It sounded so hideous... that just hearing it made me nauseous.

<Mion>
"Someone naming himself as my grandfather Sohei Sonozaki's superior confessed...
 that those canned goods had been human flesh."
Hinamizawa, a village in which demons lived and ate humans.
...They were just about to wipe away that cursed stigma...
The light they had finally started to see in their peaceful lives... grew hazy and disappeared.
The shocking truth... as revealed by his former superior...
...The stolen provisions from the old Japanese army that had been a huge cornerstone for Hinamizawa's revival...
 had been... canned human flesh.
Why were there cans like that?
Wasn't Sohei just the manager of food warehouses...?
His superior revealed that Sohei Sonozaki did not have the job of managing the food...

<Mion>
"...In reality, Sohei's job during the war had been to exterminate pestilent mice and to transport the corpses of those with infectious diseases..."
...It had been unfair treatment, and all because of the lowliness of his origins.
...As a result, though, he had returned safely without having been sent to the front lines or being detained—perhaps that was the only fortunate thing to happen to him...
Finally, Sohei was enlisted as an assistant at a military medical institution.
...There, however...
 he found something even worse than the low, scorned, depressing customs of Onigafuchi Village...
 in the research they were carrying out......

<Keiichi>
"............Could that have been...
 ...well, you know.
 The bacteriological corps in the old Japanese army or whatever."

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun, you've heard of that?
 What could it be...?"
I was pretty sure it was Unit 731...
...It was a nightmare unit that devoted itself to researching terrifying bacteriological weapons to break the deadlock in the war.
They used many innocent people as fodder for horrible human experiments.
...They methodically observed how many days a new strain would take to kill the victims.
How many days it would be when injected.
How many days it would be when swallowed.
...They dissected many people to find that out.
Sometimes, they wouldn't bother waiting until they were dead, and dissected them while they were still alive...
...They would strap them into centrifuges while still alive, and crush them in decompression chambers while still alive.
...When a live human decompresses... all the holes in their body get pushed outwards... and their intestines get pushed out of their anus like a snake winding out of it...
...I have a feeling... I saw something like that on a documentary one time...

<Keiichi>
"......That makes me sick...
 ...and they still hate Hinamizawa, huh..."

<Mion>
"......You said it."
Mion agreed with me, giving a faint, sad smile.
...It wasn't much in the way of communication, but for some reason I was happy to have it right now...
...The military's designs at the start of the war completely fell apart, and a chronic food shortage broke out all over the battlefront.
The food shortage led to malnutrition, and as their natural resistances lowered, the soldiers fell to one disease after another.
Spirit and morale lowered as well—they wouldn't be able to maintain their forces at this rate.
 Apparently that's where the research started.
At first, it was to find methods of delivering food to battlefields.
...It was very broad, and included things from violent methods like stealing it from citizens to survival methods like how to cook unfamiliar insects and plant life.
As they were working out the details, they kept straying off course and going out of control...
 until finally they knocked down a door called 'taboo.'

<Mion>
"...What do you think the easiest source of protein on a battlefield is...?"

<Keiichi>
"............"
Rena and I......
 knew the answer without being told.
 ...So we didn't answer.
...At last, they had a handful of test prototypes.
 ...When the soldiers learned it was human flesh, however, the scientists couldn't make anyone eat it.
...So it was apparently sent to the front lines.
The cans were labeled meat substitutes, and so that they wouldn't accidentally eat it themselves, they stamped the bottoms with a circle...

<Mion>
"...The starved soldiers on the front lines apparently loved all the prototypes they were sent.
 Among them, those who cooked it in soy sauce, like it was sukiyaki, loved it the most..."

<Rena>
"C-Come on, Mii-chan, stop...
 ......I'm getting sick to my stomach..."
Rena really was pale-faced, and she looked like she was having difficulty continuing to sit on her knees...
Mion looked like she had more to say, but she sighed lightly and stopped there.

<Keiichi>
"...Then... those canned goods your grandpa brought back..."
............The stifling silence came back.
...What a seriously hopeless...
 and sad story it was.
......They discriminated, were discriminated against, discriminated, and were discriminated against.
Why must they attach worth and rank to it?
Why can't they live without looking down on people?
Why...... can't everyone enjoy life together?
 ...I didn't know.

<Mion>
"...My grandmother, the family head, once told the children of the village this..."
If they throw a stone at one of you... then two of you must throw stones back.
...The children asked her.
What if they threw stones at two of us?
 Of course, the answer was simple.

<Mion>
"...If they throw stones at two of you, throw them back with four.
 If they chase eight of you with sticks, drive them off with sixteen.
 If they slander thirty of you, yell back with sixty."
Finally, the children asked...
What if we're attacked by a thousand people...?
 Even that answer was simple.

<Mion>
"...If a thousand people attack you, then everyone in Hinamizawa will stand up against them.
 ...It was a manifesto to spur people into action. 

<Mion>
...My grandmother rose up not only as the leader of the Sonozaki house, but as the mother of Hinamizawa."
It was halfway through 1955.
It was a time when riots over the treaty with the U.S. were rampant, a time of battle and action.
The people of Hinamizawa joined together and fought, treating unfair discrimination towards one as a crime against them all.
It didn't matter whether that one was a child or an adult.
If they heard that a child had been told off, then everyone would crowd the house of the perpetrator, acting as a whole.
If they heard an adult had been treated unfairly, men and women, young and old, would all band together and stand up against it.
...If you meddled with people from Hinamizawa, you would be in trouble...
 They probably figured that if they could make others think that, they'd win.

<Mion>
"............Kei-chan, do you remember how many people came to help you when you got involved with those delinquents in town...?"

<Keiichi>
"............"
I recalled how much of an impression it had left on me...
 that the people of Hinamizawa boldly came to my rescue, yet the people of Okinomiya averted their eyes so they wouldn't get involved.

<Mion>
"...My grandmother fought, and my parents carried on the fight.
 ...At last... peace returned to Hinamizawa.
 ...Of course, that peace had been placed on a razor's edge. 

<Mion>
...When you consider the previous hundred years of history, the tranquility now can only be called a chance interval, standing on uneven scales."

<Keiichi>
".........Why..."
Could I really have an opinion on such a long and difficult history when I hadn't moved here more than a year ago?
...Yet... I said it anyway.

<Keiichi>
"Why... can't everyone just live in peace...?
 ...What happened to those old stories of Oyashiro-sama that I heard from Takano-san?"
Man and demon joined hands and lived together in harmony.
...Didn't Oyashiro-sama remain in this world to watch over that?

<Mion>
"......It's a fairy tale.
 ...I mean... that even if those people and the demons were real, the Oyashiro-sama who mediated between them wasn't."

<Rena>
"............Is that...
 why Oyashiro-sama's curse happens...?"
...A cool gust of wind blows in from outside, fluttering Mion's long, beautifully clear hair.
Mion kept her refreshing smile, without answering, and didn't even change her expression... but even that became a silent answer.

<Mion>
"...So that Hinamizawa Village might once more be like Onigafuchi Village.
 So that we may again be a sacred existence, worthy of worship.
 ...That was the earnest wish of our ancestors in Onigafuchi... 

<Mion>
and the mission of those who inherit the 'demon' in the Sonozaki main family."

<Keiichi>
".........Those who inherit... the demon?"

<Mion>
"......For generations, the Sonozaki family has had a custom of including the character for 'demon' in the leaders' names.
 ...If you write out my name on your hand, it should appear plain as day..."
I trace out the word 'Mion' on the palm of my hand.
 ...Oh... She's right.
 The character for 'demon' is in there...

<Mion>
"......Not only in my name, either.
 ...The demon is engraved on my body as well."
When she said that, she quietly rose, and...
 began to lay her hand on her clothing.

<Rena>
"It's okay, Mii-chan.
 ......You don't need to show us, okay?"

<Mion>
"......Thank you."
...With just that exchange... I guessed what she meant.
......Most likely...
 somewhere on her body...
 there was a permanent seal, such as a tattoo or marking... that proved that she inherited the demon.
Mion didn't sit back down—she smoothly opened the paper door onto the porch.
...A refreshing breeze began to cleanse the damp air filling the room.
Mion quietly gazed out at the wide yard... for quite a while.
...On her shoulders...... was something I could never imagine the normal Mion carrying...
...It was the heavy,
 heavy,
 ...truly heavy...
 history of Hinamizawa—no, of Onigafuchi—weighing down on them.
...What kind of words... could I possibly say to a Mion like that...?
Rena wasn't saying anything to her, either.
Only the voices of the cicadas drowned out the silence.........
At last... after a long period of nothing, Mion murmured.

<Mion>
"...The serial incidents happening over the past five years.

<Mion>
...I was directly related to some of them, and indirectly to others. 

<Mion>
Some were not the Sonozaki family, but were rather related to the others, the Kimiyoshi family and the Furude family.
 ...I think I was at the center of all of them."
She said it all without turning around... with her back to us.
...At some point, her tone of voice... had gone back to being the Mion we knew.

<Mion>
"......I have faith in what I've done, and don't feel any guilt.

<Mion>
...If I did... perhaps it would be that I will have to leave the stage before the heir is decided."
............

<Mion>
"......If I am caught, and tried in a court of law......
 then I suppose that's how it works nowadays.

<Mion>
...Being able to retire with Hinamizawa at the most peaceful it's been in a hundred years...
 could be the happiest thing that's ever happened to any of the Sonozaki leaders of past generations."
.........Mion leaned a shoulder against the paper door, then slid down it and flopped on the ground.
...It was an act of such resignation that just seeing it made me hurt inside.
......The numerous terrible crimes Mion had been a part of suddenly began to fade from my mind...
...Hey, Mion.
 ...I don't care what happens after this.
...Can't you just try to struggle as much as you can... try to run away...?
...As soon as I began to think that way, Rena's ringing voice filled the room.

<Rena>
"But... Rika-chan and Satoko-chan
...................................
 You killed them, didn't you, Mii-chan?"
...The sharp points of her words stabbed into my chest despite not being directed at me.

<Rena>
"I'm not saying that it's okay if you killed other people.
 ...Regardless, Mii-chan...
 You killed Rika-chan and Satoko-chan."
Rena's words... were more biting than any I had ever heard.
...Even now that we knew all the heavy history pressing down on Mion's shoulders... she had criticized her for killing our friends.

<Mion>
"............Just as I bear the duty of the Sonozaki family, Rika-chan bore the duty of the Furude family.
 ...That duty... was to protect the ritual storehouse."
...My chest tightened.

<Mion>
"......I learned around last year... that Rika-chan had said something about it.
 ...The bars on the storehouse door were too heavy for her... and she wanted to change them to a simpler lock and key. 

<Mion>
...Even the priest before her had complained about it being heavy.
 ...He was very aware of how hard it was for Rika-chan."

<Rika>
"...I will make sure to guard it, so I want to replace the lock with something lighter."
I replied on the behalf of the Sonozaki family leader...
...Ever since the string of freak death incidents, there seem to be people who are insolent towards Oyashiro-sama, so you shouldn't replace the lock with a simpler one.
...That said...
 The leader of the Kimiyoshi family...
 old man Kimiyoshi, he...
If it's that difficult for you, Rika-chan, then I think it's okay to replace the lock, he said.
The very fact that it was locked with a key was an indication of it being somewhere you mustn't enter.
...There's nobody bad enough to break through it and go inside... he said.
......Even if we were alike as leaders... I couldn't find it in me to argue with old man Kimiyoshi, since I owed him so much...
In the end, we decided to change out the lock on the storehouse... and switched it to a really cheap and light padlock.

<Mion>
"...Old man.
 Is this really all right?
 Nana says that if possible, we should keep the lock the same."

<Kiichiro>
"It'll be all right.
 You're quite the worrywart.
 ...If something happens, this old man will take all the responsibility."

<Mion>
"...Do you promise?
 ...You mean that you will take responsibility as the leader of the Kimiyoshi family, right?
 ...You should... be well aware of how sacred the things inside really are..."

<Rika>
"......It's okay.
 There aren't any bad cats in Hinamizawa who would open the lock and break in.
 ......Meow, meow."

<Keiichi>
"Ooh... oouuh...!!!"
Sobs... escaped from my mouth.
...Something hot and wet dripped down in spades and fell onto the tatami mat.

<Mion>
"...I had already heard of the thieves entering the ritual storehouse during the Watanagashi festival.
 ...There were four of them.
 We decided to act within the day. 

<Mion>
...At the same time... we needed to demand that the ones who allowed the thieves to break in, Rika-chan of the Furude family and old man Kimiyoshi, take responsibility..."
My tears... dripped and dropped.
 Dripped and dropped...
Until just now...... I had decided that it was Mion's fault... that she killed Rika-chan and the others.
...That was wrong!!!
The one who killed them wasn't Mion...
 it was me!!

<Keiichi>
"...I... I might as well have... killed them...!!"

<Rena>
"Ke... Keiichi-kun......"
I had... a chance to stop this tragedy from happening, and yet...
 I didn't.
...Cheap curiosity got the better of me...... and I didn't.
If, at the time... I had stopped us from sneaking into the ritual storehouse...... Rika-chan and the others wouldn't have had to die...!
If I had... then nothing would have happened.
We would be spending our days... having lots of fun... like we always did...!!

<Keiichi>
"...I... I was...... an idiot......!!!"
If by shedding tears I could take it all back...
 then I would have filled up the room with them.
...However... such a meager act wouldn't be enough to redeem myself... for the crime I've committed.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan...
 You're not at fault."
Mion gently began to speak to me... as if trying to reason with me.

<Mion>
"As the leader of the Sonozaki family, I needed to act...
 But given the history of the Sonozaki family... Thinking about it now, it's no big deal. 

<Mion>
...Maybe I should have saved my friends... even if it meant casting all that aside.
 ...I yielded to it... and that's why I killed those two.
 ...I, Mion Sonozaki, and nobody else, killed them. 

<Mion>
...I had hundreds of chances to stop it, but...
 ...I didn't stop.
 I gave in to the easy role that was handed to me............ and abandoned all thought of fighting for my friends.
 So this is my crime. 

<Mion>
I killed them.
 Mion Sonozaki... with these hands...
 killed them,
 and nothing whatsoever changed.
 Nothing!
 ......Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha..."
Her masochistic laughter... was sad.
Especially because Mion boasted in club that she would turn the tables on whatever predicaments presented themselves.
 ......It was so painful.

<Rena>
"...Still... Mii-chan, you saved one person of your own volition."

<Mion>
"Eh...?"
As I looked at her surprised, Rena stuck her finger right at my forehead.

<Rena>
"...You left Keiichi-kun alive.
 ...As strong as you are, Mii-chan, it would have been no trouble for you, but...
 ...you didn't kill him."
That's right.
...Mion was so cunning that nobody could stand up to her, even in our club—if she had seriously tried to kill me...
 I would have been dealt with on the very first night.
So many people had been sacrificed... but I was always left out in the cold.
...When did I first realize it?
...Even though people were disappearing one after the other... for some reason, I had this vague belief that only I would be left alive.

<Mion>
"............Humm.
 ...Why didn't I kill him?
 ...As a demon, I can't even begin to guess.
 ...Maybe Mion had some reason she didn't want to kill you."

<Keiichi>
"...What is that supposed to mean?"
Shhh.
Mion put a finger to her lips to say that Rena didn't need to talk...

<Mion>
"...Is Ooishi waiting outside?"

<Rena>
"Yes."

<Mion>
"Any way out?"

<Rena>
"No.
 ...They said they have the place surrounded.
 It seemed like they called a lot of cars over the radio.
 I think they have your entire property surrounded."
Mion fell silent.
...Rena's merciless words felt cruel...
 but they weren't meant to be... maybe they were trying to lessen her good friend's pain, if only by a little—maybe they were considerate, like she was trying to help.

<Rena>
"Please...
 turn yourself in."
............Mion didn't open her mouth... but she smiled, just a little.

<Rena>
"We'll go with you.
 ...We'll never leave a friend by herself."

<Mion>
"............Crying children and Rena are the only things I can't beat!
 Ahahahaha..."
She rose, scratching her head.
 ...Her face had returned entirely to that of the usual Mion.

<Mion>
"I'm well aware... of how serious my own crimes are.
 ...Even if they accept me turning myself in...
 I'll probably never be able to come back here."

<Rena>
"............"
......I couldn't say anything.
...The number of deaths Mion was involved in...
 was just too large.
...So much so that maybe recommending that she turn herself in... was, in a way, extremely cruel.

<Mion>
"So, I'd like you to hear one last selfish request."

<Rena>
"What is it?"

<Mion>
"Thirty minutes is fine...
 Just let me have some time alone with Kei-chan."
.........Huh?
My name suddenly came up... and it looked like I was the only one surprised about that.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun...
 is that okay with you?
 ...If you don't want to, then I won't make you."

<Mion>
"............You're right.
 It's okay if you don't want to.
 ...After all, I'm a demon...
 and Kei-chan is a bona fide human who moved here from somewhere else. 

<Mion>
...For us to be compatible... as long as Oyashiro-sama doesn't exist to mediate...
 simply isn't possible."
.........There was no reason for me to hesitate.
Mion had been engulfed... by heavy, unopposable tradition...
 ...The one who had forced her to kill her friends with her own hands...... That was me, and me alone.
In fact... with me cornered, it would have been okay for her to blame me.
...However...
 Mion didn't say one word of blame.
...Far from it—I was guilty of the same crime...
 and she let me go.
Amidst the fate she could not oppose... she saved me alone.
...I didn't know whether I should be thankful for that.
Thinking upon it now...
 I didn't know how much easier it would be...
 if I were to be granted the same punishment... as Rika-chan and the others.
The only thing... I knew for sure......
 was that I had an equal duty to bear......
 the sins that Mion shouldered.
So... when it came to Mion's last request...
 there was no reason for me to hesitate.

<Keiichi>
"Sure.
 ...It's fine."

<Mion>
"............Thank you."

<Rena>
"......I'd like to thank you too,
 Keiichi-kun."
Rena stood up.
...It looked like she would keep her promise with Mion and leave.

<Mion>
"Ah, it's fine, Rena.
 You can wait right here.
 ...I just want to go around the yard with Kei-chan.
 ...If you're bored, you can go to my room. You can read any manga you like. 

<Mion>
.........Ah, and if there are any volumes you like, you might as well take them."

<Rena>
"I don't want to.
 Mii-chan's books belong to Mii-chan.
 Rena couldn't bring them back home with her so freely."

<Mion>
"............You're such a good kid, only at times like this."
Mion took Rena's head and rubbed it violently like I always did.

<Mion>
"Okay... let's go, Kei-chan."
I began to walk after Mion, who headed for the hallway... when Rena silently stopped me.

<Rena>
".........Take care...
 of Mii-chan."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah."

<Rena>
".........Mii-chan... really does believe she won't ever be able to come back."
...I didn't know much about laws... but with as many deaths as she'd been involved in, the chances of her escaping a heavy punishment... seemed non-existent.

<Rena>
".........Watch out... that she doesn't do anything rash, okay?"
Mion might not surrender herself to justice... but instead choose to put an end to things herself.
......Rena had already thought that far ahead.

<Keiichi>
"Right.
 ...I won't let that happen."
Rena rubbed at her tears, which had fallen without me noticing them

<Rena>
"Okay... then go after her."
I nodded and followed Mion, who had disappeared out the front door.
...I could clearly hear Rena sobbing from the other side of the paper door.

<Rena>
"......Why was Mii-chan... made a successor to demons?

<Rena>
...Maybe it just had to happen that way...

<Rena>
......But...
 It's just so......
 awful............"
Something hot burned down my cheeks.
 ......They were my tears.
I fiercely wiped them away.
...This was the last of my time I could offer to Mion, so I absolutely didn't want to let her see my tears during it.
Mion was already waiting outside the front door.........



[Watanagashi Ch.19]

I put on my shoes, tapped my toes against the floor a few times, then left—and Mion timidly came over.
...Why is she turning all red at a time like this...?

<Mion>
"Can I... hold your arm?"
............It was such a modest request.

<Keiichi>
"...I don't mind."
...With my permission, her face lit up with glee, like a child being given a toy, and took my arm.

<Mion>
"...Do you get kind of nervous... with your arm through mine?
 You're not thinking for example... that I'd suddenly put you in a world-class joint lock, or anything...?"

<Keiichi>
"...You two say the same things.
 I don't think that.
 At all."
Back when... nothing had gone wrong yet.
...During those nostalgic days of the bustling commotion at Angel Mort.
...I counted back, and was amazed.
 It had only been one week ago.
I had been arm in arm with Shion then, too.
Linking arms with Mion like this...... really reminded me that they were twins.
...How much strength they put into it, the sensation of their arms... their warmth, and the blood flowing... I could feel that their living sensations were all exactly the same.

<Mion>
"............I think Shion liked you, Kei-chan."

<Keiichi>
"......I see."
If this were a regular conversation... I might have jumped back, red in the face.
Right now, though... no matter what I heard, my mind remained at peace.

<Keiichi>
"...Mion and Shion... you got along well, didn't you...?"

<Mion>
"Well......... I wonder.
 ...Kei-chan, do you think your right hand and left hand get along?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 My right hand and left hand?
 ...I don't think you could describe them as getting along or not..."

<Mion>
"That's how our relationship is.
 You can't measure it by the scale of how well we get along."
...That didn't sound like it meant they got along really well.

<Mion>
"For example, one of your hands is dominant, so there will always be a better hand.
 ...If you only had one oven mitt, you would put it on your dominant hand without thinking, right? 

<Mion>
I think maybe it was like that for us."

<Keiichi>
"............"

<Mion>
"That doesn't mean, though, that anyone would be okay with losing their left hand.
 ...It's that kind of unexplainable relationship."

<Keiichi>
"......I think that maybe... you lived too close together, and just stopped being able to see it, but...
 I think that means you get along really well.
 ...I'm an only child, so... the day before the festival... 

<Keiichi>
I was really jealous of when you and Shion were messing around with each other."

<Mion>
"......I think you're jealous of something that doesn't exist.
 Yes, we twins used to have a lot of fun playing tricks on people... 

<Mion>
But now that we have such distinctly different personalities, it just gets in the way."
Were they cursed, or were they self-conscious?
 ...Their relationship was hard to understand for an outsider.
Maybe that wasn't an issue someone like me should intrude on.
...Just staying silent and nodding gently was the best way to advance the conversation.
Mion passed through the wide yard... and invited me into the big, desolate forest we'd seen on the way in.
...Such a big forest was part of their property... so I couldn't help but feel small.

<Keiichi>
"............It's huge.
 You must have had a great time playing in it as kids, huh?"

<Mion>
"............"
Mion seemed to be silently reminiscing.
......I couldn't look into her mind... but she was probably thinking back to those fun days, when they played as sisters without any antagonism.
Every time the wind blew, it caressed the treetops and the leaves, making a swishing, murmuring sound.
...Mion remained silent for a long time.
Thinking back... on her younger sister...... whom she had gotten rid of with her own hands.
There was no need for me to get a word in.
...Just walking like this...
 arm in arm...
 was enough.
...Mion suddenly stopped and turned.

<Mion>
"............Shion is...
 still alive."

<Keiichi>
"...Really?"
Mion took a hard look into my eyes, then nodded quietly.

<Mion>
"............Yeah.
 ...I'd been thinking to give her the most horrible death of all, so I had her locked up.
 ......I never did think of a good way to do it, though."
...Mion sounded as though she hated Shion... but also... deep down... she didn't completely detest her.
...So I took my other hand and rustled Mion's hair with it.
Mion didn't only save me.
 She saved Shion, too.
...Mion may have become a demon and led many people to their deaths.
 ......But she fought against it... and was able to save... two people.
As I petted Mion... she narrowed her eyes in an entranced smile...
 and untangled her arm from mine.
Then... Mion quietly said,

<Mion>
".........Come with me.
 ...I want you to see all of my sins.
 ...Although, Kei-chan... it might be the worst thing you've ever seen."

<Keiichi>
"............"
I could sense it.
...There I would probably find... all the sacrifices up until now.
...Looking at them... would mean accepting Rika-chan and Satoko's deaths.
As well as... accepting that... my best friend had done it.

<Mion>
"............It's already happened, and it's in the past.
 ......You can choose not to look, Kei-chan.
 If you don't want to, then wait here.
 ...I will personally end everything."
I was taken aback by how ominous that sounded.
......I remembered what Rena had told me.
Mion might not surrender herself to justice... but choose to put an end to things herself.
...I couldn't leave her on her own.
...Besides, I agreed to her last request, didn't I?
...Even if it was hard for me to accept... I'll still do it.
...Even if I avoided looking...
 it was...
 something...
 that had already happened.

<Keiichi>
"............It doesn't matter what I see."

<Mion>
"Yes?"

<Keiichi>
"............Mion Sonozaki... is the best friend I could ever have.
 That won't change.
 It never will."
The treetops softly swayed in the wind...

<Mion>
"............You and Rena both.
 ......Why do you only get really cool at times like this?"
Normally I'd say something rude right back at her, evading the question... but today I didn't.
 ...I just answered with a smile.
At last, Mion started walking.
 ...Into the thick forest... into the deepest part.
After following a thin path that looked like an animal trail for a while... we finally came across a steep incline with a tunnel that reminded me of a coal mine or bomb shelter.
We were surrounded by shallow hills—it had been created in a spot not visible from the outside.
...There were many silhouettes of crows in the trees here and there.
...The abnormal odor I'd been smelling for a while... was doubtlessly escaping from inside this place.

<Mion>
"............If you want to turn back, now's your chance.
 I don't know what kind of person Mion Sonozaki is to you...
 but if you go inside... that Mion will probably...
............"

<Keiichi>
"She won't change.
 I'll say it as many times as I need to.
 ...Mion Sonozaki is the best friend I could ever have."
I clench my fists.
...Inside there... was probably a sight beyond anything I could imagine.
If... I let my guard down... I might end up vomiting.
Even so... I'll endure it.
 ...I'll overcome this pain and this suffering.
 ...It will never change... that Mion is my greatest friend.

<Mion>
"............I am nothing more than a demon...
 so I don't understand human feelings anymore.
 ...I have a feeling, though...
 that I know why Mion fell in love with you."

<Keiichi>
"...Don't say that like it's not related to you.
 You're Mion.
 You're not a demon.
 ...You're a human, with human blood, and you're my friend."
...Mion made a gesture like she was wiping tears from her eyes, then placed a hand on the big door of the tunnel entrance.
The lock on it was dauntingly strong-looking.
...It seemed to demand the appropriate resolution from whoever would enter, just like the ritual storehouse.
When the double doors opened... a stifling, rotten air and a bunch of winged insects came rushing out.
I remembered accidentally killing a hermit crab a long time ago by leaving its tank out on the porch... and how intense the odor it left was.
...If that was the smell of a corpse... then that's certainly what this smelled like.
Inside, it was pitch black, but Mion flicked a switch that turned on a light bulb, illuminating the interior.
The path turned into a series of intricate wooden tunnels.
We passed spaces that looked like they were for storage.
We passed places that looked like someone had lived there.
...All this indicated that it had been used as a bomb shelter and stockpile during the war.
...It didn't give an impression of a dug-out bomb shelter that had just been left there, though—there was a sense of dignity, as though this were a second Sonozaki house constructed underground.
Despite being in pitch darkness below the ground, the voices of the cicadas were entering through an air hole somewhere, giving it a very mysterious feel.

<Mion>
"...You saw what was in the ritual storehouse, right?
 The piles of torture instruments.
 ...All of them were created to uphold the strict religious laws of Onigafuchi Village. 

<Mion>
They were tools used to kill those who broke the laws in terrible ways as a warning to others."

<Keiichi>
"............That was a long time ago."

<Mion>
"...Watanagashi, originally a ritual meant as a deterrent, was once overseen by the Three Families... 

<Mion>
but thanks to the Kimiyoshi and Furude families going into decline and the way the times changed, actually carrying it out became difficult."

<Keiichi>
"...I can imagine why.
 ...You'd never think people could be okay with drowning people in a swamp and killing them in modern Japan."

<Mion>
"That's why... the Sonozaki family built this.
 ...A secret place... so that we could continue to conduct the rite of Watanagashi, even in modern times."
Mion opened a large, strikingly different door...
......and inside...
 ......was none other than...
 a modern storehouse for ritual implements......

<Mion>
"...There's... quite a few, isn't there?
 Some of them were actually brought here from the original storehouse."
............All of the things there had been rusty and covered in dust, so they didn't seem that real...
 but the things in here were different.
Every one of them had been well maintained... and kept in a state that they could be used right away.
Blades gleamed and spikes were sharpened.
Also, perhaps as a precaution for the splatter of blood...
 the walls and ceiling were covered in the kind of tiling you would see in bathrooms... and there was even a drain set amidst a slight slope in the floor.
There was also a coiled rubber hose along the wall attached to a faucet, perhaps for cleaning up the splattered blood.

<Mion>
"...According to something a leader from a long time ago wrote...
 Blood splatter has impact, despite the fact that it doesn't tax the sacrifice.
 ...Watanagashi was meant as a deterrent, after all. 

<Mion>
My ancestors thought up all different kinds of things to show off."
As she said that, Mion pointed deeper into the torture room, to a spot veiled in darkness.
There... was surprisingly a room floored with tatami mats... and in the corner was a pile of cushions.

<Mion>
"...They're seats for the audience.
 Watanagashi was meant as a deterrent, after all.
 It wouldn't make sense if there were no guests."

<Keiichi>
"............"
I couldn't speak... and I couldn't think of anything to say anyway.
...Except that if Mion revealing all this to me made her heart feel any lighter, then I was prepared to listen for as long as I needed to.

<Mion>
"Right here...
 ............is where I killed everyone.
 ...There were no spectators to watch me... but I did the Watanagashi very well.
 ...Well, perhaps there was one spectator."

<Keiichi>
"...Huh?
 A spectator...?"

<Mion>
"...Me.
 I, the demon, was watching the entire time Mion held the Watanagashi ceremony."
Mion cackled in self-deprecation.
...It wasn't a nice-sounding laugh.

<Mion>
"Back there is the prison."

<Keiichi>
"...Is Shion there...?"
She nodded slightly.
......Mion's Watanagashi... had ended today.
...I needed to tell Shion that I was safe without a moment's delay.
...After all, she was probably trembling in fear at this very moment, worrying about when she would be killed.
The ostentatious door on the other side opened, revealing what must have been an incredibly expansive space based on the echo it made.
Mion groped around in the darkness, and a handful of naked light bulbs came on here and there.
...As my eyes adjusted, more and more of the great cave showed itself in the faint light...
The walls were bare rock surface, and it felt so savage that 'bomb shelter' was the most apt term for it...
There were small, barred rooms built here and there, like holes made by insects biting their way through a giant piece of fruit.
 ...It was immediately clear that each one of them was a prison.

<Keiichi>
".........Where is... everyone? Rika-chan, and Satoko...?"

<Mion>
"...Their corpses?"
...I grimaced at her having said it so outright.

<Keiichi>
"......Yeah.
 ...That's right.
 ...The poor things, being left here in the dark like this."

<Mion>
"............I didn't want them to get infested with bugs, so I threw them down the well.
 .........I'm sorry."

<Keiichi>
"............"
So I can't even see their faces in death...
...Once again... my feelings of regret at having confessed everything to Rika-chan came surging forth.
If Mion hadn't attached the word 'sorry' to the end of what she said, I might have punched her.
...Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...
...You said it yourself—no matter what, Mion Sonozaki is your greatest friend!

<Keiichi>
"......Yeah... My greatest friend..."
I needed to hear myself say it out loud.
Then came the clattering of bars in one of the cells deeper in.
When I noticed it, I looked up as well.

<Keiichi>
"............Shion?!
 ............Is that Shion?!?!"

<Shion>
"Ke... Kei-chan?!
 Is that you, Kei-chan?!"
I ran over to the cell.
...White hands were peeking out through the gaps in the bars.
 ...It really was her.

<Keiichi>
"Are you all right, Shion?!
 Are you hurt...?!"

<Shion>
"...N...... no...... no.........
 nooooooooooooooooo!!!!"
Shion's face twisted out of shape as she screamed.
...It was because Mion had appeared right behind me.
 ...Of course.
 ...Shion didn't know that everything was over yet.

<Keiichi>
"Calm down, Shion.
 ...Everything is already over.
 ...Everything."
I spoke in as calm a voice as I could manage to try and soothe the agitated Shion.
...However, it didn't seem like it was getting through her screams...

<Mion>
"Shion.
 ...How have you been...?"

<Shion>
"No more... please...!
 No more!!
 I don't want to see anyone else die!!!
 If you hate me... then just kill me already!!!
 I'm the one you hate, right?!
 Kill me, kill me right now!!
 Siiiiiiiiiiiiis!!!!"

<Keiichi>
"C... Calm down, Shion!
 It's all over now.
 ...It's going to be alright.
 So calm down..."
Shion, who was screaming and rattling the iron bars back and forth... was truly in a frantic state.
......I gave a slight shrug of resignation, giving way to Mion.
...I had realized that if Mion was the one who locked her in here... and if Mion was the one who had scared Shion this much... then Mion was also the only one who could put an end to this...
Mion spoke from over my shoulder.
 Quietly.

<Mion>
"Relax.
 I won't kill you.
 ...No, I won't kill you just yet.
 ......Ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku-ku...!!"
She burst out into a bizarre laugh... as if trying to make Shion's madness even worse.
Shion broke out into a fierce shiver... brought on by that laugh... and rattled the iron bars as she wailed...

<Shion>
"Please stoooooop!!!
 Don't kill Kei-chaaaaan!!
 Kei-chan has nothing to do with this, does he?!
 If you're going to kill someone... then kill me right now!!!
 I don't want anyone else... to dieeeeeeeee!!!!"

<Mion>
"Ah-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!!
 If you want to die that badly, then after I've killed this man, I'll take my time making mincemeat out of you. 

<Mion>
...In accordance with the ancient rites, I'll do it slowly, starting with your extremities.
 I'll shave you down and mince you.
 I had that mincing machine set up specifically for you, after all. 

<Mion>
...Or would it be funnier if I were to mince up Kei-chan in front of you?"

<Keiichi>
"...H-Hey, quit it already!
 What do you have to gain by scaring her at this point...?!"

<Shion>
"Nooooo!
 Kei-chan, run awaaaaayyyyyy!!!"
I tried to rebuke Mion for flinging terrible words at her this late in the game, but...
 when I turned around...
Mion's mouth, so much so that it was hard to believe... had twisted into a shape even thinner than a crescent moon... it was a smile.
...I could sense it like a jolt of electricity.
......The person here... wasn't my best friend Mion.
It wasn't the Mion Sonozaki who had been tossed about by her heavy duty of succeeding the Sonozaki family, either.
 ...Then...
 who... was she...?
Ba-baamm!!!!
I saw sparks flying before my eyes, like what happens when you get hit in the back of the head.
...The strength in my body drained instantly, and my head suddenly became heavy.
...My knees buckled under the temptation and hit the floor.
 ...Then, my whole body abruptly collapsed.
My face should have hit the floor, but it was comfortable, as if I had fallen onto a down-filled futon...
......My consciousness reeled, then receded.
It was the kind of sensation... like if you took a nap in the car... but you were still half-awake, and could listen to your parents talking as if they were far away.
No, you wouldn't be listening, you would only be hearing it.
...It was happening so far away, and the conversation was completely unrelated to you, so you would have no interest in it...
...So whether Shion was yelling in my ears or Mion was in vulgar hysterics, I didn't think it annoying, nor did it interest me.

<Mion>
"Now then... I wonder how I should go about preparing you!
 Oh, yes. What do you think of a bed of nails?
 I tested it on those two little brats, but their hands were too small for the restraining table!! 

<Mion>
Let's do that, let's do that! Ah-hahahahahahahahaha!!"
Mion held me up from behind and dragged me across the floor.
 ...The soles of my feet scraped on it, and one of my shoes fell off.

<Shion>
"Noooooooooo!!!
 Please, stop, siiiiiiiiiiiiis...!!
 ...Please......
 stop......
 .........uahhh... aah... ah..."
Shion's emotions exploded outward... and she burst into bitter weeping.
...As if her crying had whetted Mion's interest, she held flung me down and returned to the prison cell again.

<Mion>
"...My, you sure can cry with a cute voice, can't you?

<Mion>
Your unnatural bravado was making my skin crawl, but this definitely suits you the best.
 Ku-ku-ku-ku!"

<Shion>
".........Mion, my big sister.
 I beg you.
 ...I don't care how you choose to kill me, but...
 please, at least let Kei-chan go.
 ...I'm begging you............"
...Shion had always acted as though she were a cut above her older sister.
...That Shion... in such a miserable voice that I couldn't have imagined it during those peaceful times...
 ...prostrated herself before the older sister she used to scoff at and pleaded forgiveness.
Mion looked down with an expression of cool indifference... one that was plainly smiling with joy.

<Mion>
"...You know, I wasn't planning on listening to your petty wishes.
 The way you're crying, though, is just too funny...
 I think maybe I'll change my mind and listen to you.

<Mion>
...Since come to think of it, I never did anything big-sister-like for you."

<Shion>
"...Yes.
 ...Yes.
 ...Thank you, thank you so much..."

<Mion>
"All right then.
 Let's hear you apologize for everything.
 Then maybe I'll let it all be water under the bridge...
 ...and maybe, just maybe, I'll let Kei-chan go."
...Mion said she might let me go... but she never said anything about letting Shion go.
Before long... Shion got on her hands and knees behind the bars... and began to speak weak words of apology.
...They were too faint for me to hear... but their intention got across.
Despite having watched her with a magnificently jubilant expression, Mion kicked the bars and declared she was unsatisfied.

<Mion>
"...You think you can make up for years of grudges and hard feelings like that?
 That just will not do.
 ...I guess I'll make mincemeat out of you both!!!!"

<Shion>
"Nooooooooooooooo!!!
 Wait, sis!!!!
 One more chance!!
 Just one more chance...!!"
...Mion stopped and waved her hand again in resignation.
...Not because she had grown impatient... but only because she was taking delight in abusing Shion.

<Mion>
"...You can't apologize to my satisfaction anyway.
 ...I'll teach you how to make an apology that will get through to your older sister. 

<Mion>
...I'm only going to tell you once, and if you get even a letter wrong, you're out.
 ...Got it?"

<Shion>
"...Yes.
 ...Yes...
 ...Thaaank yoou, sis...
 Ooh..."
Shion's miserable voice... cried out... having become utterly hoarse.
...The sensation tearing through my chest... returned a little at a time.
 ...I realized...
it was feelings of anger bubbling up.
I was slowly... regaining control of my body...!
However, I was only able to feel my skin and my blood flowing at the moment.
...I still couldn't... voluntarily move my fingers......!

<Mion>
"...Did you memorize it?
 Then let's hear you say it.
 Sincerely and faithfully, from beginning to end, with all your heart.
 ............If you can do it properly, then I'll only kill you."

<Shion>
"...Yes...
 Thank you... Thank you so much...!"
......Something was strange...
 Something had become strange at some point...
...Until just a few moments ago... I was sure this had been Mion, but...
 ...At some point, at some point... she had become someone else...!!
The Mion I knew well... would never do something so nasty like enjoy trampling all over someone's dignity like this...!!!

<Mion>
"Now.
 Let's hear it.
 Your big sister is listening closely."

<Shion>
"............Shi...
 Shion Sonozaki is..."
When I ran over to Shion's cell earlier, had the real thing been swapped out with a fake right behind me...?!
Anyway... this couldn't...
 possibly be Mion!!

<Shion>
...and when I think of... th-the countless times I've been rude... to my big sister... w-without knowing my place...
 uhk......"

<Mion>
"Yes, yes, that's the spirit.
 ...I'll permit you to say a little more now, okay~?"
...Blood circulated through my whole body...
My numbed senses were returning...
Just... a little more...!!
...While Shion is still holding Mion's... no, that thing pretending to be Mion's attention...... Hurry up...!!

<Shion>
"...I reflect on... how impertinent I've been...
 and swear loyalty to my big sister Mion...
 for the rest of my life...
 ...So... uuh......"

<Mion>
"Ah-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha......!!"

Mion's burst of laughter echoed throughout the big cave, growing to a terrifying level.
...That was not the laugh of someone who was alive in this world.
 ...It was none other...
 than the laugh of a demon... from the bowels of the earth.
She laughed from her stomach until she grew tired of it, and stopped smiling suddenly as if snipping a wire.

<Mion>
"All right already.
 ...That was funny enough for me.
 I didn't think you'd throw away that much of your pride.
 Mm-hmm.
 That was plenty enjoyable."
Mion... began to drag me again, after I finally got the feeling in my body back... and pulled me towards the torture chamber.

<Shion>
"S... Sis...!!
 ...Only... k-kill me...
 Please... forgive him......"

<Mion>
"Don't worry, all right?
 I'll be sure to kill you real good.
 ...After letting you get an earful of Kei-chan's screams, that is...!"

<Shion>
"............N... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!"
After dragging me to the torture chamber, she skillfully strapped me into the restraining table.
 Before I knew it, I was sprawled out and bound...
She forced open my hands, with which I couldn't even make a satisfying fist, and tightly restrained each one of my fingers...
...She fastened only my hands, and my fingers at that, tightly with hinges and locked them in place.

<Shion>
"...Siiiiiiiiiiiis...
 Don't kill hiimmmm...
 Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis...!!"
The door to the big cave with the jails had been left open, so I could hear Shion's cries of mortification the entire time.

<Mion>
"Can you hear it, Shion!?
 I'm going to get started now!!
 Please, enjoy Kei-chan's young screams!!"

<Keiichi>
"............Give it a fucking rest..."
The feeling in my body returned, and the first action I took was to tell off that thing that looked like Mion.

<Mion>
"Awake at last, are we?
 I lied before, you know.
 ...About having wanted to give Shion the most miserable death of all, but locking her up because I hadn't thought of a good way yet.
 That was a lie."
Mion brought over something like a toolbox.
...From inside it, she removed a large, metal hammer, and next to that, she began to line up what looked like long, strangely-shaped nails whose ends had been turned into hooks like the kind you'd see on a harpoon.

<Mion>
"I'll let her hear the screams of all those people that died because of her, and after they've soaked in to her very soul, then I'll kill her.
 ......I've got pretty good taste, huh?
 Ku-ku-ku-ku!!"

<Keiichi>
"............Who......
 are you?"

<Mion>
"Hah?
 I'm Mion.
 Mion Sonozaki.
 ...Has the fear driven you crazy? Ku-ku-ku!"

<Keiichi>
"............No, you're not.
 ...There's... no way you can be Mion Sonozaki...!"
Mion snorted... and continued her preparations for the horrifying torture...

<Mion>
"...I see.
 Then if I'm not Mion, who am I?"

<Keiichi>
"............A demon."

<Mion>
"Huh?"

<Keiichi>
"............You're not Mion.
 ...Mion was just here. Give her back."

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan, is your brain really doing okay?
 You're not going crazy with fear?"

<Keiichi>
"Don't touch me!!!
 ...You damn demon...!!!
 Give her back!!
 Give Mion back!!!
 My best friend... give Mion baaaaaaack!!!"
...Mion stood there for a few moments with her jaw hanging open, not having expected me to say that.
I myself knew... that I was about to go insane.
...I knew it was nonsense... to demand Mion's return when she was right in front of me.
 But... but...!
 This person in front of me... couldn't possibly have been Mion!!!
 There was no way... I could accept that...!!
So... this is what I thought.
Mion really had... been possessed by a demon... and was controlling Mion as if it were a separate personality...!!!
Mion was just a victim being manipulated by it... The evil one was really... this thing!
It all had to be the doing of this demon possessing her...!!!

<Mion>
"Ahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!! Ahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!"
When Mion heard that... she started to guffaw, laughing so hysterically that she started to cough and almost choked.

<Mion>
"............You really are... a piece of work, you know that?
 In this very moment, Mion Sonozaki is trying to kill you, and you're trying to reject me? 

<Mion>
...I never knew there was such a funny person in all the world."

<Keiichi>
"............If you want to laugh, do it all you want.
 ...No matter what you say, though, I won't accept that you're Mion.
 ...Give her back.
 Away with you, demon!!!!"

<Mion>
"Wahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!
 ...Kei-chan... Are you trying to kill me by drowning me in my own tears...?
 Wahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!"
No matter what... I wouldn't lose to that laughter of hers.
 I shouted loudly.
...I shouted from the bottom of my heart... so that the real Mion, trapped inside the Mion I saw in front of me... would be able to hear......

<Keiichi>
"You can do it, Mion...!
 Don't... lose to this piece of shit demon...!!!
 You're strong... Show me how strong you aaaareee!!!"

<Mion>
"Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Wahhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!"
The tears welled up and flooded down her face...
Her hands were busy with the restraints, so she couldn't even wipe them—she just let them flow.

<Keiichi>
"Please... Mion...!!!
 Mion!!
 Where... did you lose to a demon like this?!
 You're not that weak, are you?!
 Don't lose...
 Fight...
 Fight!!!"
Mion, desperately enduring her laughter, pressed one of the long nails to the tip of my left pinky.
...In her left hand was the hammer.
 ...At her side were dozens more nails.
...I could tell what she was about to do... though I wish I couldn't.
...Even so... I couldn't afford to be scared.
 ...That was why I shouted!!

<Mion>
"Wahh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha......
 Haah...... My sides hurt like they're about to split.
 ......Is that all?
 I'm going to get started now.
 Be sure to give her some good screams. 

<Mion>
Not only am I torturing you, Kei-chan, but I'm torturing Shion as well."

<Keiichi>
"............Why...
 ...............why...
 ...would you...
 ...............Mion...!!!"
Then... I wept.
 ...Only sobs came out.
...They weren't in acceptance of the torture about to be performed, however.
......They were tears of regret... that Mion had lost to the demon.
...Yet, a small change did occur in the Mion in front of me.
...Her heightened excitement... was draining, little by little.
...By the time I'd realized it...
 the one in front of me... had returned to being Mion.

<Mion>
"............Kei-chan.
 ...This may not be... something pleasant to take to the grave with you.
 .........You really seem to want to know, though, so I'll tell you just one thing."
.........I didn't know... if this was Mion...
 or just a display of momentary humanity the demon had recovered.

<Mion>
"......A long time before the demon came to live inside me.
 ...It was gnawing at my heart, trying to spur me to violence, but...
 I suppressed it with my reason. 

<Mion>
...That settled the demon down... and I got to thinking it had gone away somewhere.
 ...As it turned out, I was wrong.
 .........It hadn't left me... it had just gone to sleep."
.........I noticed that there were... tears forming in her eyes.

<Mion>
"...The demon... woke up again due to a certain, small opportunity.
 ......What do you think... that opportunity was...?"
............There was a sad, and yet reproachful light in Mion's eyes.

<Mion>
"......Do you understand?"
............I don't...
I don't know... what gave the demon the chance to beat Mion.

<Mion>
"............
This might be strange for me, a demon, to say, but...
 ...You're the reason that everything got so messed up.
...The tears welling up... in her eyes... spilled downward all of a sudden.

<Mion>
"............At the time...
 if you had given me that doll you got without hesitating.........
 maybe everything wouldn't have gotten so twisted."
The doll I got...
...That.. doll that I got... when we had our club meeting at the toy store that Sunday...

<Mion>
"...You probably can't understand.
 I wouldn't expect you to.
 ......But, you see, all sorts of things started falling over like dominoes after that... and soon it was too much for me to control. 

<Mion>
...It only makes sense that you wouldn't be aware of knocking over the first one, since it was so small...... but you're the one who set it up."

<Keiichi>
"............That can't...... Me..........?"

<Mion>
".......If you hadn't made 'Mion' cry... then I wouldn't have had to wake up.
 ............Is that enough?
 For you to die in peace...?"
.......A mistake......
 that I'd made on that day...........
 was what messed everything up......?

<Keiichi>
"...That... that can't... be, can it...?"

<Mion>
"............It only makes sense that you wouldn't be aware of it.
 Even so, Kei-chan, you are without a doubt the cause. 

<Mion>
.........If you had nonchalantly given me the doll that day...... then I don't think this would have happened."
......I wanted to say 'ah,' like I'd just... remembered something... as I recalled that day...
...Rena had told me about that... and I thought I had apologized.
...I didn't apologize to Mion, though.
 It had been... Shion.
...In other words... Oh, god...
...I hadn't... said a single word of apology... to Mion...
Today, I came to this house, saying I had something to apologize for... but I never said a word of apology about this.
...Come to think of it... when I apologized for going into the ritual storehouse... Mion looked a little bit lonely, like she was disappointed.
...Why didn't I... realize that until just now...?!
Rena told me at the time... and now she, herself... no... the demon was telling me...
...Is the only way for a dense idiot like me... to be cured... to die altogether...?!?!

<Keiichi>
"...........Ugh....... ooh...!!"
I could no longer... hold back the hot tears from pouring out of me.
I simply... just cried and cried...... and reflected indifferently... on the taste of my tears... on the taste of regret...
Mion pressed the tip of a nail to my left pinky finger.
......My wrists, my arms, and all the joints on my fingers were strapped in so tightly it hurt... and I couldn't even twitch.

<Mion>
"............I didn't hesitate at all when I was torturing the others.
 ...Why do I hesitate now?"

<Keiichi>
"............If this will satisfy your demon, Mion..."
If it will sate the demon, then do to me what you will...

<Mion>
"...........Are...
 you serious...?"

<Keiichi>
"...Compared to how much I hurt Mion... this is nothing, right?"

<Mion>
"............"

<Keiichi>
"...Do as much as you want.
 ...In exchange... promise me two things."
Mion was silent.
 ...She did, however... wait for me to speak.

<Keiichi>
"..........After you're satisfied with causing me pain... forgive Shion.
 ...She's been punished enough to make up for her crime of sneaking into the storehouse, hasn't she?"

<Mion>
"You......
 After all this... you can still worry about Shion more than yourself...?"

<Keiichi>
"...The other thing...
 is that when you've had your fill... you disappear.
 ......Give that body...
 back to Mion.
 ............That's all."

<Mion>
"............
 ............You know, you're... Are you not even considering possibly begging for your life or anything?"

<Keiichi>
".........Can I ask you to promise three things instead of two?
 ...The third is to leave me alive."

<Mion>
"...Ahahahahaha.
 You said two in the beginning, didn't you?
 ...So you can't have any more."

<Keiichi>
"............That's a shame..."
In... such an abnormal situation... Mion and I laughed quietly together... as if sharing in a stupid joke...

<Mion>
"...I probably won't keep these promises, understand?
 I'm a demon, after all."

<Keiichi>
"I guess there's nothing I can do, then..."
......I recalled tightening my hands into fists when enduring the pain at the dentist's office.
...Right now, though, they were opened all the way to my fingertips, so I couldn't even grip them.
...So instead, I tightened my toes.
...Okay... do it.
I've prepared myself already.
So do it.
 ...You waiting like this to hammer the nails in is scarier.
...It's going to diminish my readiness, after all...
Mion put down the hammer... and gently stroked my cheek.

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan.
 I'll... agree to just the third thing, okay?"

<Keiichi>
"............Huh?"
My third wish.
...To save me.
 ........She'll agree to it...?

<Mion>
"Your first wish.
 To save Shion.
 ...That's long done for.
 ...The demon will kill her.
 ...It's already been decided, so I can't stop it.
 So give up on that."
Her delicate fingers... slid from my cheek... to my chin.

<Mion>
"As for your second wish.
 To give this body back to Mion.
 ...That won't happen either.
 ...After today, Mion will never come back.
 ......From today on, even if my body is here, it will be just a body... 

<Mion>
...because the oni has taken it over."

<Keiichi>
".........That isn't true.
 ...Mion is... Mion...!
 Don't say such sad things... like that she won't ever come back...!"

<Mion>
"............
Can you hear it?
 That sound."
Mion gently closed her eyes and listened...
...I definitely heard it as well.
...Slaa...am...
 ............slaaaam...
It was a dull noise that repeated at fixed intervals.
 ...A low noise accompanied by vibrations.
A lot of people were ramming the iron doors to this underground ritual storehouse...

<Mion>
"You're late, so Rena probably called Ooishi.
 ......That spaced-out girl being so quick-thinking was the one thing I didn't anticipate."

<Keiichi>
"............I'll agree with you there."
Mion grinned like she'd been outwitted, then took something that looked like an electric razor out of her pocket.
...When she pressed the switch, pale blue sparks flew out with a snapping noise.

<Keiichi>
"...Was that what you hit me with before?
 ......That's not a toy children should be playing with, you know."

<Mion>
"Ku-ku-ku.
 ...You're right."
She seemed to want to use the stun gun on me.
...Unable to move, I felt her press the cool lump of metal to my neck.
Slaaa...aaam!
I heard a roar, as though they'd broken down the first, large door.
The halls were a bit complex... but aside from the door to this very torture chamber, there was nothing in their way.

<Mion>
"...I won't kill you, but I will have you go to sleep for a bit, Kei-chan.
 Ooishi will be here soon.
 This will only hurt a bit."
...Feeling the same shock as before...
Gritting my teeth wasn't going to help much... but I clenched them tightly anyway.
However, just as she did when she was about to hammer the nails in, she hesitated a little.
...I cracked open my tightly closed eyelids...

<Mion>
"............I'm sorry...
 for disgracing Mion."

<Keiichi>
"......I made a promise before coming in here.
 Whatever happens, the Mion inside my heart won't change."

<Mion>
"............Look, forget about that.
 If you ever see me after today...
 don't come near me.
 ...By then, it will be the demon... that inherited my corpse."
What are you talking about?
 ...Just as I tried to say that... a much stronger light than before shined... and like a television being switched off... my consciousness went black...



[Watanagashi Epilogue 1]

June, 1983.

A string of disappearances occurred in Hinamizawa Village, Shishibone City, ＸＸ Prefecture.

The suspect is Mion Sonozaki (1X years old).

She is suspected to have kidnapped five Hinamizawa residents between June 19 and June 21 (Oryou Sonozaki, Shion Sonozaki, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou), imprisoned them, and killed them.

Preliminary investigations on the incident were delayed at the time due to insufficient evidence, but it was resolved coincidentally and shockingly.

On the morning of the 23rd, a vehicle patrolling the Sonozaki property heard screams from inside and rushed in as an emergency measure.

They secured the suspect's missing younger sister (Shion Sonozaki) and her two missing classmates (Keiichi Maebara and Rena Ryuugu).

 The suspect fled the scene.

Deep in the detached basement on the Sonozaki property, which is believed to have been used to kill those who disappeared, we discovered hair, flakes of skin, blood, etc. of the other four missing persons (Oryou Sonozaki, Kiichirou Kimiyoshi, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou).

We concluded that the missing persons were tortured in the torture chamber.

 However, their remains have still not been found.

At one of her imprisoned classmates' advice, we continued searching the detached basement of the Sonozaki property, which was where they were imprisoned, believing that they were there; however, we still have not located them or the suspect's escape route.

In addition, investigations are continuing as to her participation in the serial freak death incidents of recent years, thinking it would give some clue...
 
...but no evidence that Mion Sonozaki was involved, either directly or indirectly, has been found.

There are still many unclear points as to the motive behind the incident, and as those of the Sonozaki family and the residents of Hinamizawa have been extremely uncooperative in assisting us, we expect to require a long time to clarify them.

The opinion of a local officer knowledgeable about the region is that this may have been a lynching—an internal form of punishing sacrilegious acts carried out against the beliefs of Hinamizawa Village.

It is clear that these incidents are particularly rooted in this region, and the prefectural police department has ordered a cautious investigation.

We anticipated gaining valuable clues from the missing person believed to have been imprisoned for the longest time, Shion Sonozaki—the suspect's younger sister...

...but her mind was stricken by the grave aftereffects of the incident, and she has not been in a state of mind to properly answer any questions about what she knows.

The psychiatrist concluded that she is in a temporary state of shock, but it doesn't seem hopeful that she will recover today either.

...............Only a few days...
 passed since that time.
After that, I was rescued by Ooishi-san and his subordinates, whom Rena had called in.
Aside from my entirely blank state of mind, I had no external injuries.
The most I had was the small burn mark from where the stun gun hit me.
...As I was having a check-up in the hospital... Ooishi-san asked me all sorts of things...
but I don't really remember what he asked, or how I answered him.
From what I heard... surprisingly, Mion still hadn't been captured.
There were apparently a great many hallways and smaller rooms extending out from the depths of the prison.
...It wouldn't be strange if she had fled to one of those and hidden herself.
The one fortunate aspect amidst all the misfortune... was that Shion had been safely secured by the police.
When I last saw Mion... she seemed like she was going to take me with her and then kill me...
...She probably didn't have enough time to, though, since Ooishi-san came running in faster than she predicted.
...That... was the only really fortunate thing to have happened.
Of course... the rescued Shion...... despite having no external wounds... now had a big, deep wound in her heart.
...She was in a severe state of confusion when they rescued her, and apparently she bit the police officers trying to resist.
From what he heard, she was seeing Mion in everyone she saw,
 hated not only the hospital, but even her own home,
 and had shut herself up somewhere in Shishibone, hiding her location...
...Additionally, in fear that Mion would come for her, she was moving from place to place every day, and even her parents weren't sure where she actually was.
Wherever she was living... even now, Shion was spending her days in fear of Mion's shadow...
The police were investigating the Sonozaki's underground storehouse at this moment.
Since... they couldn't find the remains of the other sacrifices.
...Hadn't Mion...
 thrown the corpses into a well...?
 I had a feeling I'd said that to him.
That meant a hidden tunnel, vertical like a well, was somewhere in those underground passages.
The secret underground, without any maps or architectural drawings...
which had swallowed up the remains of Rika-chan, Satoko,
 and everyone else... was still unwilling to speak the truth...
I was brought back to that basement again too, for an on-the-site inspection or something...
 but I didn't remember being of any help.
.........I never wanted to go back there again.
For days afterward, the Sonozakis living in Okinomiya—in other words, Mion and Shion's parents, the big name yakuza—would come to our house to apologize, bringing many of their followers with them.
However much my parents refused it, they piled up many hundred thousand yen bills, calling it consolation money, every day.
The amount of money grew each day, and after it had passed two million yen, they were then given an envelope containing a letter.
...I don't know what was written in the letter.
My parents talked about it by themselves for two whole nights............
 and decided to move away.

<Rena>
"...I see.
 ...You're moving, huh?
 ...When?"

<Keiichi>
"At the end of next month.
 ......I won't even have been in Hinamizawa for half a year."

<Rena>
"............
I'll be lonely.
 ...I'm the only one...
 left."
Rena smiled sadly...
If I had just said "yeah"... I thought it would make her even more lonely, so I changed the subject.

<Keiichi>
"............Here's something to think about."
That's how I broached it.
Mion hadn't actually fled......
but had been demoned away in the truest sense of the term...
Where she went after she disappeared...
 that, we didn't know.
What was there... where she had disappeared to?
.........I hoped there was a hobby shop dealing in imports—the kind Mion liked.
In that place... she would definitely be free from the burdensome fetters of her family...
 ...and live not as Mion Sonozaki,
 but as just Mion, and enjoy herself...
...Maybe she's already met up with Satoko and Rika-chan.
They must also... have been waiting for the day Rena and I would join them...
 ......spending all their time doing club activities...
 as lively as they always were...
When I told Rena that, she smiled and nodded to me...
The incidents the Sonozaki family had been trying so hard to hide, too, were exposed to the magazines from this single tiny seam.
The serial incidents of recent years were all pulled up like a long vine in the ground, one by one... and for many days, news of it was brought up on talk and variety shows.
The shows, which were comedic and silly, never once tried to touch upon the grim... heavy history that Mion had been bearing.
......It made me mad to see them bringing this stuff up in jest... but there was nothing I could do about it now.
How big an impression...
would these short few weeks I spent in Hinamizawa...
 have on my life?
...During these few weeks,
 I met my best friends,
 and had the best experiences of my life.
...I would probably...
 never forget it for as long as I lived.
As for the distorted image of Mion that the media created...
...After the masses got tired of treating her like a plaything,
 they would ball her up, throw her in the trash,
 and then she would fade from their memories.
As somebody... as one of the few people who knew the real Mion... I must always make sure I remember her.
...Beyond any doubt... that will surely become my offering to her.
...The sky reached so far up... and towering cumulonimbus clouds floated through it.
The real summer... was just before our eyes.
Even now... whenever 10 PM came around... I would expect a phone call from Shion—or Mion, rather.
Now that everything was over, of course, she...
 would never call me.
...But it was precisely because she wouldn't call me...
 that I was scared...
 of who would call me...
 this time.
...Plus... Mion still hadn't been caught.
...I couldn't say for sure... that everything was completely over.
On the other side of that fear, though... were my prayers that Mion was safe.
...When I thought like that, I was able to sleep, even with such terrifying thoughts.
The lights were off.
...Before, her attacking when the lights were off... was something that scared me.
...However, that feeling changed to regret within two days.
The moonlight filtering through the gap in the curtains shone onto the desk... and illuminated a doll.
......That's right.
......The doll,
 ......
that I should have given to Mion that day.
She said it was an import from England or something, and was all the rage, didn't she?
......From what Shion said, the most popular among them were the ones wearing the fluffy dress.
After being released from the incident... the first place I went to was that toy store.
Everything was apparently sold out besides the things on the storefront displays.
...I was refused once when they said they wouldn't sell the display products... but when they realized I was Survivor A from 'that incident,' they immediately consented.
...Of course, even if I bought it... I might never have the chance to give it to her again.
Even knowing that...... I waited for the opportunity to give it to her.
I waited like this... for the opportunity... with it on the desk, so I could give it to her at any time.
Plonk.
...There was a weird noise.
...It was a noise I wasn't used to hearing.
It was too... big to be raindrops... and it was completely different from the sound lost bugs make when they ram into fluorescent lights.
I figured I must have misheard, and nestled back into my futon...
Plonk.
...The noise happened again.
I wasn't hearing things.
 ...I definitely heard it.
Where was it coming from?
I got up and turned on the light.
...If there was a second, there would be a third.
 ...From where, though...
 I listened carefully...
Plonk.
The window.
 ...Some sort of pebbles... were colliding with my window.
When I realized they weren't being blown there by the wind, but rather being thrown by a person, I gave a start.
I looked at the clock... It was 2 AM.
...Who would it be... at a time like this...
...I quietly peek out front... through the gap in the curtains.
In the light at the gate... despite it being so late, I saw someone.
They picked up a piece of gravel... and threw it at this window.
 ...It hit the window and made a plonking noise.
Who was it............

<Keiichi>
"............Ah............!"
I caught my breath in surprise...
If my eyes weren't deceiving me... that person was...
 ...Mion.
I threw open the window and looked at the figure again.
M... My eyes certainly weren't deceiving me.
...It was Mion!
 ...It was Mion!!
 She was... alive!!
Mion pressed her index finger to her lips and made a 'shhhh' motion so I wouldn't shout.
If she hadn't... well, I was nearly about to cry out.
...Mion was in... a very delicate position right now.
...Even if it was the middle of the night, I shouldn't call out her name.
I waved to her, gesturing that I'd be right over, flung on my coat atop my pajamas, and flew out the door.
.........I quickly hit the brakes just before going down the stairs.
...Although happiness was sprouting within me...
 I had the sad feeling...
 that this would be our final parting.
So I went back to my room again...... and grabbed the doll.
If there was a god...... I don't think I would have ever thanked him as much as today.
...Even if it would be... the last time we ever saw each other......
 ...I was so grateful... for this one chance to give it to her...!!
I slipped into my sandals,
 unlocked the door,
 unhooked the chain...
 and leaped out of the house.

<Keiichi>
"...Hah...
 Hah......
 Mion...!"

<Mion>
"Ahahahaha, it's been a while~
 ...How are you?
 Been doing all right?"
It was like... how we used to meet every morning... Mion waved to me and responded like she always did.
It was doubtlessly... Mion.
 ...It was the real Mion...

<Keiichi>
"...Are you...
 all right... hanging around this place...?!"

<Mion>
".........I really shouldn't be.
 ...Ehehehe."
...She certainly... wasn't acting like she knew the police were following her.
It was almost like... she was a patient who had gotten tired of staying in the hospital and had snuck out...
 Her speech was relaxed enough to make me think that... and I couldn't help but be surprised.
...That relaxation, I thought, was more like Mion... and I was happy for it.

<Keiichi>
"Anyway... what's wrong?
 What do you need at this hour?"

<Mion>
"...I wanted to talk to you one last time."
That was when I noticed them...
On Mion's forehead... were big droplets of sweat.
...Her expression, too, which I had thought to be a satisfied smile... was, upon closer inspection, trembling slightly... and I realized that she was forcing it.

<Mion>
"......Well, I...
 ehehehe...
 I can't...
 stay for any longer..."
A pained note was beginning to enter her words as well...
 As if just smiling... was a feat for her.

<Keiichi>
"A-Are you all right...?
 Are you not feeling well...?"

<Mion>
"...I tried... s-s... so hard until now...
 Ahahaha...
 but I can tell.
 ...I'm done... this is my limit...
 They're...
 ...
 about to come up behind me to take me away...
 Ahahaha......"
Mion's smile... crumbled... and started to stiffen.
...Did she... push herself this much... to come all this way for me......?

<Mion>
"Ah... hahaha...
 haha... ha...
 hah......
 hah......
 hah...!"
Her laughter cut off... and changed into rough breathing.
I reached out to rub her back, but she knocked me away.

<Keiichi>
"Are you okay...?!
 Don't force yourself...
 Oh... that's right.
 ...I had something—"
To give you, Mion.
 ...This doll......
...I had wanted to do this one last thing...
 because I knew how little time you had left.
...But this last thing, it
 ............obgh...
............Gh...
 guh
............
...My stomach...
 is burning.
......Mion...
 ...took a... meat... cleaver-like knife...
 and stabbed me...
...And pushed it... in tight... and took it...
 and twisted...
 it...
Mi...on...?
...Hey...
 wha...
 t...
 it......
 hurts...

<Mion>
"Hee.....
 heeheehee...
 heeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee
 ...!
 I made it...
 ...I made it...!
 ...
 Huheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee
 !!!"
I cowered... on the ground.
...My stomach was so hot... it was almost spewing fire...
Mion watched it, then took a few steps back... and cackled.

<Mion>
"Geegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegee!!
 I've done it! I've done it all!
 That's everyone... I wanted to kill...!!!
 Gegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegeegee!!"
...The last words Mion left me with that day... came back to me.

<Mion>
"...After today, Mion will never come back."
From today on, even if my body is here,
 a body is all it will be.
...By then, the demon will have taken it over.
The demon.
 ...The demon.
 ......The demon.

<Keiichi>
"...Mi......
 Mi...............
 on............"
...This can't...........
 I thought we had.........
 finally been able to meet...
...This...
 can't...............
 Mion.........
...In a pool of blood of my own design...
 is the doll I bought for Mion...
 dyed...
 in red......
 so red...............
............Mion............
The good fortune of having been allowed to meet Mion once more...
 and the misfortune of that meeting being torn apart before my eyes.
 ...Should I be grateful, or curse it?
...My emotions were neither of those... as my consciousness sunk deep into a black swamp......
The doll I bought for Mion...... the blood...
 had ruined it......
No matter how I scrubbed and scrubbed... it had needlessly
 ...
been...
 ruined
 ...
 ruin...

The

[Watanagashi Epilogue 2]

June 28, 1983.

A violent incident occurred in Hinamizawa Village, Shishibone City, ＸＸ Prefecture.

The victim was Keiichi Maebara, also a victim of the previous string of disappearances.

At around 2:00 AM, he was stabbed in the stomach with a bladed object by the suspect of the last case (Mion Sonozaki) and was gravely wounded.

He was discovered when his parents woke up, and was then transported to the clinic.

 He escaped death.

The criminal fled the scene.

On the same day, at approximately the same time.

A fall accident occurred in the Kamiishiki apartment complex in Shishibone City, ＸＸ Prefecture.

The victim was Shion Sonozaki, also a victim of the previous string of disappearances.

Late on the same night, neighbors overheard her having a big fight with someone and informed the manager.

The manager used a master key to enter the room and discovered that the victim had fallen from her eighth-floor balcony to her death.

The room had been torn apart and appeared to show traces of a fight.

One neighbor has frequently visited the Sonozaki house for a long time, and testified that he heard what sounded just like the two sisters having a fight, trading insults back and forth.

We believed this was related to the injury case that occurred the same day in Hinamizawa Village, perpetrated by said incident's suspect,
 
and did a thorough search of the room, but we could not find any traces that would imply that anyone but the victim was present.

The victim fell straight down into the foliage of a parking strip.

 Her neck broke and she died immediately.

Her clothing was disheveled, and had markings that would imply a scuffle.

...We also believe, however, that it could have been an insanity-induced suicide attempt, based on the particular mental state of the victim after the incident.

We are conducting a thorough examination on both fronts, suicide and homicide...


<Doctor>
"......Only for five minutes, understand?
 Please, try not to excite him."

<Ooishi>
"Yes, yes. I'll be careful."
Kaclack.
The door opened... and as I expected, Ooishi-san came in.

<Ooishi>
"Hello, hello, Maebara-san.
 It's been a while, hasn't it?
 Tell me, how have you been since then?"

<Keiichi>
"...The doctor says my post-operative recovery seems to be going smoothly... but I think I got worse when I saw your face."

<Ooishi>
"Nah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You wound me."
As Ooishi-san gave a laugh that smelled of sweat, he handed Mom a bag of assorted candies he must have purchased from the souvenir corner on the first floor of the hospital.

<Ooishi>
"Excuse me, Mrs. Maebara.
 Would it be possible for me to talk to Keiichi-kun for just a few moments?"
Mom clearly wasn't pleased at the thought of a police officer talking to her son without her there.
...However, I insisted.

<Keiichi>
"......Mom.
 Sorry, just a little while.
 Just five minutes, okay?"
Though grudgingly, Mom left the room.
When she closed the door, Ooishi-san grinned widely and looked around the room.

<Ooishi>
"A room to yourself—how high class!
 My old lady always gets a shared room, you know.
 It is quite lively, however.
 Seems like you're a higher rank if you have a worse disease in places like that. 

<Ooishi>
The sicker you are, the prouder you are—or maybe the more arrogant..."

<Keiichi>
"...Ooishi-san, we only have five minutes.
 I would like it if these were the last five minutes we ever saw each other.

<Keiichi>
......I don't have any connection to Hinamizawa anymore... and this isn't in Hinamizawa anymore either."

<Ooishi>
"...Yes, because there aren't any general hospitals in Okinomiya.
 ...Mind if I take a seat?
 Down we go."
This was a large university hospital in Shishibone City.
It was splendidly urban, entirely different from the likes of Hinamizawa and Okinomiya.
It was hard to believe Hinamizawa was part of the same city.

<Ooishi>
"When does it look like you'll get transferred?"

<Keiichi>
"Dunno.
 ...I'm ready to go whenever, though."
Our moving plans were delayed a little because of my serious injury.
My parents had already left the house in Hinamizawa, though, and were living in our new one.
They planned to have me transfer hospitals to be closer to the new house once I'd recovered enough to be taken there.

<Keiichi>
"...Please, don't come to where I'm transferring.
 I really will get worse then."

<Ooishi>
"Man... You really do hate me.
 It may just be my job, but that stings.
 That's why I brought you all kinds of lovely souvenirs in atonement."

<Keiichi>
"......You didn't need to bring an assortment of cookies for that."

<Ooishi>
"Well, you see...
 There aren't actually cookies in there.
 Look~"
Ooishi-san pulls open the can of cookies, and
 ......
Nwahh?!
 Ow, ow, I'm stretching my scar...

<Ooishi>
"I didn't know what you were into, Maebara-san, so I brought all sorts of things~
 See, all sorts of cute-looking ones, from Westerns to comic strips!
 Lately they have this sort of H-manga aimed at girls, too~"

<Keiichi>
"D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Don't bring porn in here~!!!
 Take them away, and go home!!
 Ow, ow ow ow ow...!!"

<Ooishi>
"Nfu-fu-fu!
 I thought for sure a healthy young person like you would be feeling a little needy, being cooped up in a place like this for sooooo long. 

<Ooishi>
If you stay here too long, the only fetish you'll end up with is a nurse one, you know.

<Ooishi>
There are plenty of other beautiful things in this world besides nurses, after all!
 Don't decide what to major in now—keep your options open!
 You need to be a more all-around type of person. 

<Ooishi>
Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu!!"
I gave Ooishi-san's vulgar laughter a pained grin.
...Somehow or other, I understood.
The fact that Ooishi-san was bringing it up like this...
 meant that he must have had something important to talk about.

<Ooishi>
"............The incident with Shion-san really was unfortunate."

<Keiichi>
"............"
The night I was stabbed by Mion.
Shion fell from her balcony and died.
...They said the police were investigating all possibilities—accident, suicide, and homicide—but it could only have been Mion's doing...
Mion found out where Shion was hiding... and pushed her down to her death.
 Nothing else was conceivable.

<Keiichi>
"............It couldn't have been an accident.
 ......It was Mion.
 ...It had to be."

<Ooishi>
"......The criminology guys are saying it had to be a suicide, but I'm of the same opinion as you, Maebara-san.
 ...She pushed Shion-san, and also stabbed you.
 ...In one night."

<Keiichi>
"............
Has Mion...
 still not been found?"

<Ooishi>
"Oh, that's right.
 That's what I came here to tell you today.
 ...Yes.
 We actually did find her."

<Keiichi>
"What?!
 ......Ow, ow ow ow..."
...Learning that... felt rather strange to me.
I was partly relieved that the incident was truly over... and I was partly sorry that my best friend had finally been caught.
 ...I felt many other things, too...
 ...My heart was a maze of emotions.

<Ooishi>
"That's not all.
 In the Sonozaki house catacombs.
 ...We found a hidden well.

<Ooishi>
Just as you said, Maebara-san, we found the remains of all those who disappeared at the bottom."

<Keiichi>
"............I...
 see..."
...That sliver of hope, that possibility I'd believed in... that Rika-chan and Satoko were alive... just from the fact their remains hadn't been found...
 gone.

<Ooishi>
"It was incredibly well-hidden in those catacombs.
 I mean, it was in the blind spot of another blind spot.

<Ooishi>
It was a vertical tunnel, dug out like a well.
 ...There was a ladder set up there, and when we went aaaaall the way down, there was another tunnel built there going through it. 

<Ooishi>
...When we followed it a few hundred meters, we found ourselves at the mouth of an old unused well in the mountains."

<Keiichi>
"......I wonder if it was a secret escape route a previous Sonozaki family leader built."

<Ooishi>
"Probably was.
 ...Maybe it was made in the Meiji era.
 Still... I'm impressed they built something like that."

<Keiichi>
".........
So everyone's remains......
 were at the bottom...?"

<Ooishi>
"Yes.
 ...Even deeper down than the escape path, there was a pool of coal tar.
 They'd been casually thrown into there.

<Ooishi>
They had fallen from a fairly high spot, so their remains were totally buried in it.
 ...It took a lot of time and effort to pull their bodies up."

<Keiichi>
"............
Did you...
 find them all?"
I hoped... that they at least wouldn't find Rika-chan or Satoko.
...That's what I wished for when I asked, but my shallow hope was crushed in the blink of an eye.

<Ooishi>
"Yes.
 All of them.
 ...In fact, we also found human bones we think are over a decade old.
 We think there are at least three people.
 ...I suppose it's the dark side of Hinamizawa's history. 

<Ooishi>
I wonder how many people's bones... we'll find when we've sucked out all the mud.
 ...It's a scary thought."
............That weight had been pushing down on Mion's shoulders the whole time.
......Mion.
 ............

<Ooishi>
"...We've currently identified people who disappeared from Shishibone City decades ago. 

<Ooishi>
...People are talking about how this opportunity might let us resolve the disappearing persons cases that have been abandoned."

<Keiichi>
"............"
After a deep silence...... he breathed a heavy sigh...
Ooishi-san went for his cigarettes to pass the time, but realized this was a non-smoking area, so he gave up and put them back in his shirt pocket.

<Ooishi>
"Oh, right.
 ...This is a bit of a detour......
 but you know Rika Furude-san, right?"

<Keiichi>
"Of course.
 ...She's my friend."

<Ooishi>
"Did she ever tell you anything along the lines of her regularly taking insulin injections for diabetes?"
..........??
 Rika-chan has diabetes???
 I didn't know what he was talking about.

<Ooishi>
"Actually, we found it in her skirt pocket.
 A syringe.
 It was destroyed, though, so we couldn't identify the medicine.
 ...It was a bit out of place, so I got interested.
 ...You really don't know anything?"
......I didn't know anything about Rika-chan carrying syringes around with her.
There were various dark rumors relating to the Sonozaki family.
 ...Among them, there was even baseless speculation that they were selling illegal contraband.
...Did Ooishi mean to say that Rika-chan is also suspected in relation to such things?!

<Ooishi>
"No, not at all... That isn't what I'm saying.

<Ooishi>
...It just seems strange however you look at it... that she would bring a syringe with her on her way to get soy sauce."
............I have no idea... what any of this means.
My eyes are spinning...
 ...I feel sick..............

<Ooishi>
"Are you all right?
 Should I call a nurse?"

<Keiichi>
"I... I'm fine.
 ...Please continue..."

<Ooishi>
"Well, that's all I had to say about the syringe.
 It was the only thing that personally struck me as interesting."
............Rika-chan...

<Ooishi>
"...Rika-san was sort of like the village mascot, after all.
 ...It looks like the village is in an uproar right now.
 ...Between the older blind believers, and the Sonozaki family who killed her.

<Ooishi>
The Three Families' effective control over the village is basically in shambles, too.

<Ooishi>
.........If someone came up to them with talk of a dam again, with this sort of timing, the entire village would be abandoned for sure this time."

<Keiichi>
"......I'm not... related to Hinamizawa anymore."
I actually was.
...I just said it because the thought about Hinamizawa being abandoned was unpleasant... and I wanted to end the conversation quickly.
There was a knock at the door.
It opened slightly, and my mom asked if we were still talking.

<Ooishi>
"Whoops!
 We went off topic, didn't we?
 ...What a pickle!"
............I looked at the clock.
 ...Five minutes were long past.
He told my mother that there was something he really wanted to ask, and if she could wait a little bit longer.

<Keiichi's mom>
"...Is that so?
 Keep it short, okay?"
There wasn't any getting around the fact that she was thinking about what a police officer could be talking to her son about.

<Ooishi>
".........Maybe we should choose another day for this."

<Keiichi>
"...Umm... Ooishi-san.
 .........Mion...
 How is she right now?"
I wanted to just hear that answer and then get rid of him.

<Ooishi>
"............Before I tell you that, I just need one thing from you.
 ...I just need you to answer something in all honesty."

<Keiichi>
"......What is it?"

<Ooishi>
"...............I want you to take your answer seriously, got it?
 ...If you say something indiscreet, it could be viewed as an obstruction of the investigation, and you could be prosecuted."
...Ooishi-san kept threatening me until the end.
...What the hell did he want?

<Ooishi>
"......Maebara-san.
 ...Who do you think the criminal was who pushed Shion from the balcony?"

<Keiichi>
"............There's no way it could be anyone but Mion, is there?"

<Ooishi>
"Then who was the one who stabbed you?"

<Keiichi>
"............Please don't make me say it again.
 ...It was Mion.
 ...Mion Sonozaki."
......Ooishi-san smiled bitterly, then dabbed at his forehead with a handkerchief to wipe his sweat.
He should have expected that answer, and yet it looked as though he wasn't satisfied with it.

<Keiichi>
"She pushed Shion, and stabbed me.
 ...Didn't you just admit yourself that Mion was the criminal?"

<Ooishi>
"...The evidence we have that Mion killed Shion is based on testimony from the man living next door.

<Ooishi>
...This neighbor is actually a member of an organized crime group—in other words, he was Shion-san's bodyguard. 

<Ooishi>
It seems he's a veteran leader in that vein, and was like a parent to the Sonozaki sisters growing up."
...That man said this.
The noise he heard from next door was just like the sound of a fight between the sisters that he was used to hearing when they still lived together...
 and no, there was no doubt about it.
He said he heard Mion and Shion insulting each other, and heard them struggling.
At first, though, he thought it was a hallucination she was having, brought on by her dementia.
...You see, he thought that because that sort of ruckus... had been occurring every night.
However, that night... had been longer than the rest, and he claimed that he went to her room to give her a sedative.
The noise died down while he got the manager to give him the key.
He'd already decided he'd at least check up on her, and after she wasn't answering his calls, they took the plunge and unlocked the door.
Then they saw that the room was a mess.
...Since Shion had been pushed over the balcony, they decided it had to have been Mion...
 and that's how it happened.

<Ooishi>
"...In other words, he only heard from the other side of the wall.
 Plus, because the apartment complex is connected to their organization, it doesn't have many residents. 

<Ooishi>
So they were the only ones who heard it happening.
 ...To reiterate, there was only one person who witnessed Mion Sonozaki."

<Keiichi>
"Even if he didn't see her... that's... isn't it obviously Mion's doing...?!"

<Ooishi>
"Now, settle down.
 ...This is what I'm saying.
 ...It means you are the only one who saw Mion Sonozaki for sure last night.
 After all, Shion-san, the other witness, is no longer alive."

<Keiichi>
"............What are you trying to say?
 ...I don't really understand..."
At that point, Ooishi-san paused.
The fact that this was a no-smoking area completely slipped his mind, and he took out his pack of cigarettes again.
Ker-chack. He lit one with his lighter...
 ...and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke...

<Ooishi>
"......Were you really stabbed by Mion Sonozaki?"

<Keiichi>
"Yes.
 ............There's no doubt about it."

<Ooishi>
"............"
The smoke Ooishi-san breathed out floated away... like a thundercloud swept away by the wind.

<Keiichi>
".........Ooishi-san, you can't smoke in here.
 ...The nurses will get mad."

<Ooishi>
"Actually...
 We found Mion Sonozaki at the bottom of the well too."

<Keiichi>
"............What?"

<Ooishi>
"She fell to her death.
 We believe that as she was trying to escape to that hidden passage in the well, her foot slipped while climbing down the ladder...
 she fell to the bottom,
 broke her neck, and died.
 ...Yes. 

<Ooishi>
The same way as Shion-san.
 She broke her neck."

<Keiichi>
"...Um, well...
 .................What......?"

<Ooishi>
"After you passed out that day, Mion Sonozaki tried to escape using the hidden well...
 ......but her foot slipped and she died.
 ...As if beckoned by the corpses of the other sacrifices she dropped down there."

<Keiichi>
"...............
 But...
 That doesn't make any sense, does it...?"

<Ooishi>
"The autopsy came to the conclusion that she definitely died on that day.

<Ooishi>
...She didn't go back there after attacking you and Shion-san.
 ...She was already dead by then."
My jaw... was on the floor.
...There was absolutely... no way that could be.
...Mion was the one that stabbed me... It had to have been her.
...There wouldn't have been... anyone else to do it.........

<Keiichi>
"Then...
 then...
 wh-who attacked Shion and me...?!
 Who was it...?!"

<Ooishi>
"The one who attacked you... was someone who was Mion Sonozaki, and yet not Mion Sonozaki."
......My mind had become a complete mess... and I was starting to lose my ability to think straight...

<Ooishi>
"...Do you remember how Miyo Takano-san died?"

<Keiichi>
"Eh?
 ...Takano-san?
 Ah... yes.

<Keiichi>
......I think I heard that she was... burned to death in some distant mountains..."

<Ooishi>
"We learned that she was burned after being strangled to death.
 ...The Gifu station did the autopsy.
 It's a little bit strange.

<Ooishi>
...The results of the preliminary autopsy said that she had been dead for at least twenty-four hours.
 Since that was contradictory, in their panic they seem to have revised it to say she died earlier that day."
...Despite me being an absolute wreck over what was going on with Mion...
 he was telling me...... there was even more on top of that......?
.........I didn't understand the complex things Ooishi-san was telling me...

<Ooishi>
"The result saying she had been dead for twenty-four hours, as our own old criminologist says...
 is pretty damn reliable.
 ...So then what would that mean?

<Ooishi>
...I've asked that question over and over...
 but on the night of Watanagashi...
 you were with Miyo Takano-san, weren't you?"

<Keiichi>
"......I was."

<Ooishi>
"You also met her on the day before, while setting up for the festival, right?
 I mean, I ran into her too."

<Keiichi>
"......Yes.
 ...I was with her then."

<Ooishi>
"If she'd been dead for twenty-four hours...
 then that would mean she was already dead the day before the festival."

<Keiichi>
"............Haha...
 that can't be..."

<Ooishi>
"......She was alive during the festival preparations.

<Ooishi>
However... when you all slipped into the ritual storehouse...
 Takano-san was already dead."
The origin of all that happened.
 The beginning of everything.
...Our intrusion in the ritual storehouse... which I had come to regret countless times.
The one who tempted me...
 ...............
Takano-san.
When she... invited us into the storehouse... she was already... no longer of this world...

<Ooishi>
"There are too many dead people walking around in this incident.
 ...Na-ha-ha..."
...............An incident...
 caused by a dead person...
 and ended by a dead person.

<Ooishi>
"...Also, apparently they're under pressure to revise the time of Mion Sonozaki's death not to the day of the incident, but to right after she stabbed you. 

<Ooishi>
......Probably pressure from the outside, to get this incident wrapped up already.
 ...So I'd appreciate it if you didn't say a word about this to anyone."
Ooishi-san grabbed his jacket that was hanging on the chair, put out his cigarette with the bottom of his foot, and started pretending to wave away the smoke floating around.

<Ooishi>
"I've stayed too long.

<Ooishi>
...I had come here thinking I could at least end this incident as it applied to you, but...
 ...it looks like it got even more baffling instead."
Absent-mindedly... he walked towards the door... looking at me, unable to speak, out of the corner of his eye.

<Ooishi>
"......If it so happens...
 that something comes up you want to talk about in the future, call me anytime.
 My business card is in those souvenirs from before. 

<Ooishi>
...When that time comes, I'll pay you a visit with some wonderful souvenirs again.
 Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"
Ooishi-san... seemed to think I was still hiding something.
That I... after all this... would be hiding something...?
I'm the one things are being hidden from.
 ...I'm the one who wants to know.

<Ooishi>
"Then let us meet again one day.
 Take care of yourself."
Slam.
I listened... to the tap tap tap... of Ooishi-san walking down the hallway.
 ...I still couldn't return from my state of bewilderment.
He wanted to end this incident as it applied to me...?
What was over?
Nothing was over.
...The incident...
 was still...
 continuing...
......Then, slip... an arm covered in fresh blood...
 came out from underneath the bed.
...I wasn't that surprised.
...This was... an illusion I was seeing, seized with fear...

<Mion>
<i>...Kei-chan...
 I told you, remember...</i>
I heard a... guttural voice coming from under the bed.
 ...I still recognized it as Mion's voice.

<Keiichi>
"...What, Mion?
 ......What did you tell me...?"

<Mion>
<i>...I...
 warned you on that day...</i>

<Mion>
<i>...After today...
 if you see me......
 it will be the demon...
 that has possessed my body......</i>

<Keiichi>
"...Ahahaha...
 You did... You said that, didn't you?
 ......Sorry.
 ...Guess I wasn't careful enough.
 ......That's why I got stabbed.
 ...Ahahahaha..."
Possibly wounds sustained when she fell from the ladder...
 many of her fingernails... were broken and torn...
Her arm... slowly felt about on top of the bed... searching for mine.

<Keiichi>
"Oh... hey...
 Mion.
 ...I...
 just, well,
 thought of a good joke.
 ...Want to hear it?"
............The Mion under the bed didn't answer.

<Keiichi>
"L-Let's say......
 ......that I...
 died here today...
 ...but... tomorrow, I'd still be here, living a normal life.
 ......So...... when Ooishi-san learned about it afterwards...
 the time of death wouldn't make sense, once again! 

<Keiichi>
He'd make a huge deal about how someone who should have died was alive... and he'd totally lose his head!
 Takano-san, then Mion, and then me third.
 ...So?!
 Funny, right?
 Makes you laugh, doesn't it? 

<Keiichi>
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha...!"

<Mion>
<i>............Kei-chan...............</i>

<Keiichi>
"...Laugh.
 ...Or was it n-not that funny...?"
Mion's bloodstained hand... groped around... and found my wrist.
Though her fingernails were torn... she gripped it hard... as if scratching me......

<Keiichi>
"Ow... ow, ow...
 G-Go easy......
 Ow... It hurts..."

<Mion>
<i>...Kei-chan................
 I've come for you......</i>
I tried to shake my wrist loose... but the strength she held it with was unbelievable, and I couldn't.
She was only gripping one wrist... and yet my whole body wouldn't move.
...I couldn't even twitch.
My fingers were spread apart... and I couldn't make a fist, either......
.........And that...... fact that I couldn't make a fist... reminded me of the restraining table..............
...............!!!!
I felt... a crooked nail press against my left pinky fingertip.
...Mion's forehead was split open... and with a face covered with blood... she smiled...
 and got right up... in front of my nose...
 and got right up... just behind me...

<Keiichi>
"......Nothing was over.
 ......Nothing was over.

<Keiichi>
This incident was far from being over.

<Keiichi>
...It was still going on.

<Keiichi>
It was still happening.

<Keiichi>
Someone, please end this incident.

<Keiichi>
This cruel, tragic, unfortunate, sad incident...
 Please, end it.

<Keiichi>
That...
 is my only wish..."

<Mion>
"I granted you one
 before, remember?
 You don't get any more.
 ......Ah-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"
Mion firmly held the nail down on my fingertip.
...And, with her other hand, she slowly swung a mallet up into the air, and.................



[Watanagashi tip - 01]

<Mion>
"Yep.
 Sorry.
 I suddenly got called in to my part-time job at my uncle's shop today."

<Keiichi>
"What's that?
 No club today then?"

<Mion>
"Well, ah-ha-ha, I'm sorry...!"
Mion put her hands together in apology and grinned.

<Mion>
"If you really want to do club today, then you can always do it without this old man.
 The club locker is stuffed full with games.
 You can pick whatever."
The club locker was the transdimensional space from which Mion pulled games whenever we met for club activities.
I wondered how so many freaking games could be stored in the locker—it was even smaller than the one with the cleaning supplies in it...
Besides those games, it was also a cornucopia of suspicious objects (costumes?) for punishment games...!
If we lined them all up on the floor in order to sort them, they would definitely fill the entire classroom.

<Keiichi>
"...Nah, we shouldn't.
 I get the feeling that if I mess around in that locker, everything inside will come tumbling down on me."

<Mion>
"Ah-ha-ha-ha!
 Yeah, I guess you're right.
 Maybe amateurs shouldn't meddle with this. He-he-he!"
Mion gave a hearty laugh, implying that the only one who could do so was the club president.

<Rika>
"......Mii.
 The teacher is looking for the key to the gym storehouse.
 Do you have any idea where it could be?"

<Mion>
"Eh?
 ...Did I not return it to the teachers' lounge?"
Mion said, feeling about in her pocket.
...Judging by her expression, she must have planned on returning it, but it was still in her pocket.

<Satoko>
"I knew you had it, Mion-san~!
 I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that you simply must have been the one who had it!"

<Rika>
"......I was right, too.
 Satoko and I were both right."
Giggling, Satoko and Rika-chan clapped their hands together in celebration.

<Mion>
"You're annoying!"
Slap! Clap!
Mion elbowed Satoko and Rika-chan in their heads, then headed for the teachers' lounge.

<Keiichi>
"Oh, right.
 Have you two heard?
 Mion has a part-time job, and that's why she's not coming to the club."

<Satoko>
"Oh, is that so?!
 That's so very droll of her."

<Rika>
"......Meep."
The two of them made disappointed faces.
...Whatever anyone said, Mion's club was always the number one thing I looked forward to when going to school.
It wasn't hard to agree with their melancholic expressions after hearing it wouldn't be happening today.

<Keiichi>
"So Mion's got a part-time job.
 ...I wonder what she's doing, anyway?"
Whenever Mion cancelled club, it was usually because of her job.
However, it also didn't seem like she went there every day.
She would go two or three days in a row, then not go at all for a while.
...It sounded like a pretty damn random part-time job.

<Rika>
"......She isn't working at any one shop or anything."

<Keiichi>
"She isn't? ...Then does that mean she's a day laborer?"
Mion, wearing socks and a helmet, sweating to death in a factory...
 ...I couldn't imagine such a thing.

<Satoko>
"Mion-san helps her uncles out whenever their employees go on vacations. She's like a handyman."

<Keiichi>
"Ah... I get it.
 Now that you mention it, her having a job at her uncle's place...
 I think I've heard about that before."

<Rika>
"......She has a lot of uncles who run their own shops, so Mii is in very high demand."
She has a lot of uncles who own shops?
 A lot of them?

<Satoko>
"Oh, you were unaware, Keiichi-san?
 There are many relatives of Mion-san's in Okinomiya who run their own stores."

<Keiichi>
"Huh...
 I didn't know that.
 ...So, they're all different kinds?"

<Satoko>
"Yes.
 There's a bakery, a produce market, a ramen shop,
 and many others besides.
 That toy store we went to for the club the other day is one of them."
I was dumbfounded.
 ...That's... amazing!

<Keiichi>
"...Is Mion's family blessed with some kind of crazy business sense?
 They run so many different things, it's kind of amazing!"

<Rika>
"...There are others, like a financial business, a real estate agent, an apparel business, and in the amusement industry.
 I heard they do lots of things."
Okay, a couple of weird things came up that time, but still!
 I could tell it was pretty extensive.

<Rika>
"...There are others, like a financial business, a real estate agent, an apparel business, and in the amusement industry.
 I heard they do lots of things."

<Rika>
"...There are others, like a financial business, a real estate agent, an apparel business, and in the amusement industry.
 I heard they do lots of things."

<Rika>
"...There are others, like a financial business, a real estate agent, an apparel business, and in the amusement industry.
 I heard they do lots of things."
Rika-chan and I gave her a pat on the head.

<Satoko>
"...!?
 ...W-Why are you petting me!? ...!?"

<Rika>
"......We're petting you because you're a good girl, Satoko."
Satoko was lost in confusion, but she seemed to understand she was being made fun of.



[Watanagashi tip - 02]

<Satoko>
"Huh?
 Mion-san's family?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.
 More broadly, I was just wondering if she had any brothers or anything."
I was actually wondering whether her younger twin sister named Shion really existed,
 and my curiosity got the better of me, so I quietly asked Satoko about it.

<Satoko>
"...Hmmm.
 ...I wonder...
 She might, she might not..."
She wasn't being very clear about it.
...Had Satoko never gone over to Mion's house to play?

<Keiichi>
"From your reaction... I guess you've never met any."

<Satoko>
"Yes.
 I've never seen any of her relatives except for her grandmother."
As far as I could tell... there were already dark clouds over the "Shion is real" theory.

<Satoko>
"Rika would know more than I.
 You would do well to ask her."
Satoko waved to Rika-chan, who was basking in the sunlight.

<Satoko>
"Rika!
 Do you know anything about Mion-san's family?"
Rika-chan was surprised at the sudden question.

<Rika>
"......Mii has a big family, so I don't really know everything about them."

<Keiichi>
"That many, huh...?
 For example...
 ...Hmm.
 Is there someone named Shion Sonozaki?
 Umm, well... I might have heard wrong, so she might not actually exist, but..."

<Rika>
"......You mean Shii?
 Shion exists."
Huh?
That was unexpected.
 So she was real...!

<Satoko>
"Hmm?
 Their names are quite similar, you know.
 I could get tongue-tied trying to tell the difference."

<Rika>
"......I've heard she's Mii's younger twin sister, but I haven't met her too many times."
Rika-chan knew a bit about her as well, but hadn't seen her much.

<Rika>
"......I think I met her once at a funeral a few years ago."

<Keiichi>
"She's not in this class, so maybe she goes to school in Okinomiya."

<Satoko>
"She may live there, too.
 Mion-san herself lives apart from her family with her grandmother, after all."
She didn't live with her parents?
 That was a bit odd.
 Was there something between them?

<Rika>
"......It's a very complicated family."

<Satoko>
"She seems to have many relatives.
 There are doubtless many different circumstances."
For now, I learned that she had a younger twin sister named Shion, but her family structure, including her own position, still seemed very mysterious...

<Mion>
"Oh, what are the three of you talking about?
 Let this old man in on it!"

<Satoko>
"Oh, Mion-san, you've come at a good time~!
 Might it be true that you have a younger twin sister?"
Ah... Mion... crap...

<Mion>
"...A... a younger sister...!?
 Um, well...... y-yeah.
 I do..."
Mion grew uncharacteristically red in the face, at a loss.
...I think she's looking at me...

<Satoko>
"Oh, my~!
 I had no idea~!
 What kind of person might she be?
 I would very much like to meet her sometime!!"

<Mion>
"You shouldn't bother!
 Sh-She's not cute at all!
 She's really conceited!
 Besides, other than talking to her on the phone once in a while... I haven't seen her for a long time, either...!"
...Why did it look like she was in such a panic...?
It's like she was declaring that the Shion from yesterday was actually a fake...
Anyway, this was pretty funny, so I let it go for a little while longer.
...Another Mion, under the name of Shion.
...Will I be able to see her if I go to that restaurant again?
I had a mysterious feeling, as if I'd made a new friend, despite knowing that she and Mion were the same person.

To Angel Mort, a super-famous restaurant and the envy of all enthusiasts, despite being located in the remote Shishibone City of ×× Prefecture.
Why, exactly, do the most famous stores avoid the centers of human habitation?
 It can only be because it is a trial given to us by the God of War Photography.
It's famous locally for having the best desserts in town, but that matters not to us!
If you want expensive desserts, then you can just go to a [censored] place or something!
We aim not for sweet treats... but for sweet uniforms!!
The fragrant aroma of sweat wafts from these obligatory waitress uniforms, creating no less than a public torture device!
How can their bashful flirtation be on par with all the other restaurants with cute uniforms all across the country!?

 Awaaaay!!
★The smoking areas are the real super positions? Aim for your chance at them with the tenacity of an octopus!
Ryuu: "Yesterday, I failed to get seating.
Today, I will aim for the ultimate, golden seat—the corner box in the smoking area!
Otaku are overwhelmingly non-smokers.
 So I'll procure a spot in the smoking area and set up camp there."
As expected of Ryuu, the Hunter.
He's saying his victory was decided the moment he chose his seat.
In actuality, Ryuu used the same tactic during the grand opening of Akihabara's ×××××× and succeeded in getting the best seats in the house.
Back then, he also went early in the afternoon, just after the lunch rush, and not only did he find his target seat empty, he also obtained it with ease.
By utilizing tricks such as ordering a little at a time, he effectively increased the number of opportunities for engagement, carefully scoping out his chance for a picture...
But... as if cursed by that* from the day before, the God of War Photography did not smile upon him!!
After suffering successive, firm defeats until 3 PM, he finds no chances coming his way.
And after 4 PM, a man began to take his orders—it looks as though he has been seen through...
It is the rule of a Hunter to withdraw with grace once marked......
Ryuu: "My aim was perfect... but the fork technique I used at 2:30 seemed to have backfired.
...Maybe they were wary, since I sat in a booth and left my bag on the floor...
Perhaps the hidden camera in a bag trick is already old hat...
If there were 2-digit EGs involved for sticking here half the day, I'd have a high encounter rate.
 ...I am mortified."
Even so, he still got a few pieces of gold.
...As to be expected from the Hunter.
He attained this nice angle, despite lamenting his failure.
 He is an artisan.
More surprising, though, is that this Uniform Conquest Across Japan has yielded not a single arrested person!
What an amazing start for the hunter who brags about having been to approximately half of the total prefectural police stations in the country!
* 'That' thing the day before.
The day before, our Hunter took on the Shrine Maiden Cuisine ×× in Nagoya.
His Hunter spirit showed through too zealously, and as soon as he entered the store, he was seen through, placed in a booth, and waited on by the head priest.
Despite waiting half a day, the much-anticipated shrine maidens appeared only at the time of his first order...!
A seriously huge blunder for a Hunter!!
Now then, here we have the giveaway of the Hunter's original photographs that always receive such high praise!!

We'll present one passionate reader with three all-you-can-eat low-angle pictures of the Angel Mort uniforms, chosen by the Hunter himself!!
With such blazing hot pictures, you, too, can become a war photographer today!!

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Mion.
 Here."

<Mion>
"Wha— What is it, Kei-chan...?"
I thrust the bento box she'd given me yesterday at her face.

<Keiichi>
"It's the bento box you gave me yesterday.
 Thank you.
 It was delicious."

<Mion>
"...Heeh......... ah..."
...Mion's face quickly flushed bright red.
...Hey, now, you were the one pretending to be Shion when you gave it to me...
You're gonna give it away if you get all red like that when you're being Mion...
At this rate, she might trip and fall right into her own grave, so I decided to help her out.

<Keiichi>
"Listen.
 I was pretty hungry yesterday.
 Out of the blue, Shion came all the way to my house and gave me some food in a bento box.
 This is that box.
 I made sure to wash it clean!"

<Mion>
"Ah, ...ahaha, r-right!
 Shion's really considerate, huh~?!"
That was so transparent.
...Was Mion always this terrible at lying?
...Her expression was different than usual... but it looked strangely cute.

<Mion>
"So, w-what did you think?"

<Keiichi>
"...You two are like peas in a pod.
 You're twins, right?
 Obviously you'd look the same."

<Mion>
"Umm, ...not... not that... err..."
Mion looked kind of bewildered, like she was waiting for a specific answer.
...When she said "impression," maybe she didn't mean Shion, but the bento...?

<Keiichi>
"Oh, of course!
 It was delicious."

<Mion>
"...Eh, ...ah... really?"

<Keiichi>
"I never lie about liking food.
 If I say something's good, then it's objectively good!
 You can feel free to give my recommendations to every single person you meet.
 Tell Shion it was seriously great, all right?"

<Mion>
"Ah... o-okay!
 Tell Shion, right?
 I will!
 I think she'll be happy...!
 Ahahahahaha...!"
We're going along with Shion having given it to me, not Mion, aren't we?
 Yet, her laugh... it came from deep down, and it sounded really happy.
...I guess she really can laugh nicely enough that just looking at her makes me feel better too.
 A sarcastic remark made its way onto my tongue, but I swallowed it back.
As Mion went to put the bento box in her bag, she noticed a clattering noise.

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan, there's something inside.
 Huh?
 ............Wow..."
Gah... She opened it...?!
The thing inside was a little embarrassing, so I wish she hadn't opened it here.
Panicking, I hid it with my hands!

<Keiichi>
"Umm... well!
 This is, well, my mother told me to put them in as thanks!
 I didn't come up with it or anything!
 Don't get the wrong idea!!"

<Mion>
"...It's so pretty...
 Candy..."
There was a handful of candies, neatly wrapped in paper, inside the sparkly-clean bento box.
...When I was cleaning the box out yesterday in the sink, Mom came over and interrogated me, and I fessed up as to who had given me the food.
Then she told me that something like this called for a display of gratitude.
 ...I didn't want to, because it was embarrassing, so I argued that it wouldn't be like me to do that...

<Keiichi>
"...Well... that's what happened.
 ...I mean... urgh..."
I was so embarrassed it felt like fire might shoot out of my face.
...Mion laughing the whole thing off like she usually did would be fine... but for some reason, she was staring at the candy in the box with fascination.

<Mion>
"...Th-Thank you."

<Keiichi>
"D-Don't thank me.
 Thank my mom—she put them in there!
 B-B-Besides, you're not the one I need to be thanking, right, Mion!?
 Those are for Shion, okay!?"

<Mion>
"...Ah... right.
 You're right...
 ...Okay.
 I'll be sure to tell Shion!
 I just know she'll be happy."
Mion, looking a little downtrodden, put the lid back on the box.
 ...Seemed like I ended up saying something a little mean at the end.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, you look sort of cozy today.
 Did something happen?
 Did it?"

<Satoko>
"...Perhaps she's caught a fever?
 The red in her face is probably due to the increased body temperature.
 ......Hey, Rika.
 Why are you petting my head?"

<Rika>
"......Satoko, I'm sure you'll be able to catch fevers soon enough."
...*pet* *pet*



[Watanagashi tip - 05]

<Delinquent>
"Just why ya arrestin' us?!!"

<Delinquent>
"Bullshit!!
 Leggo a me!!!"

<Ooishi>
"Kuma-chan, you can let go of their arms now.
 Here, please, sit down."
The three people rubbed their arms painfully - Kumagai-kun and the others must have been squeezing them pretty tightly.

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha...
 Don't get me wrong.
 I haven't arrested you or anything.
 Kuma-chan.
 Go get me something cold from the fridge, please.
 Would you like your barley with foam or without?
 Hmm?"
They plunked down onto the reception sofa, and despite not yelling anymore, they still had dangerous expressions.
 ...Mmm, what I'd give to be young again.

<Ooishi>
"I'll drink even if you don't, you know.
 Excuse me for helping myself.
 ......Mmmm~~~!!!
 Beer is best when you drink it on the job~!"
As he downed the beer with glee, the three people exchanged glances, then finally reached out for their cans.
...They hadn't stopped being cautious—it was more like they didn't see a reason to refuse.
They each opened their cans and began to drink the contents.

<Ooishi>
"Where did you guys come from?
 You're not from around here.
 Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"
They looked at each other again, suspicious of whether they should tell him.

<Ooishi>
"Are you all college students?
 Friends on a trip?
 You were probably travelling on bikes or something.
 Sounds like fun I wish I was having!"

<Delinquent>
"............"

<Ooishi>
"You don't live close by, do you?
 Where did you come from?
 Osaka, perhaps?"

<Delinquent>
"Whassit matter to ya?"

<Ooishi>
"Now, now, there's no use trying to intimidate me.
 You would have all been in a lot of trouble if I'd left you there, right?"
They seemed to recall the thrilling event from earlier.
...While they could understand getting surrounded by students, or a gang, or something along those lines...
...They would never have been surrounded by locals both young and old, both men and women before.
It was easy to imagine how scared they must have been.

<Ooishi>
"If you were from here, the people of Hinamizawa wouldn't have done anything to you, no matter what you had done wrong.
 ......They're all special. 

<Ooishi>
Not in the sense of parents not wanting to get involved in their children's fights.
 ...If one person gets bullied, the village will come out in full force.
 That's not just an idle threat, you know."
They couldn't argue against that.
...They themselves had been surrounded. They'd seen it with their own eyes. There was no doubt about it.

<Ooishi>
"Around these parts...
 If the people of Hinamizawa give you a glare like that, you'll simply get demoned away and no one will hear from you again.
 You'll suddenly disappear without a trace. 

<Ooishi>
...Do you all have families that would get the police to search for you if you went missing?
 If not, then that's bad.
 You'll vanish, and that'll be the end of it.
 Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"
Even then, we got there soon enough that nothing happened. If we'd been late, things could have taken a turn for the worse.
If they'd been forced into an alleyway... these young men wouldn't be sitting on a couch right now, they might be lying on an autopsy table.
 ...Nfu-fu-fu! Well, probably not...
Anyway.
 ...Perhaps they'd be a little more cooperative if we'd found them as corpses.

<Ooishi>
"...How did you all get to Okinomiya?
 By train?
 By bike?"

<Delinquent>
"...Bike."

<Ooishi>
"That's not good.
 They're still parked there, aren't they?
 If you go waltzing in to get them back, they really might gang up on you."

<Delinquent>
"......Hellsat?
 We'll take'em all!"
Calm down, calm down...
Why are young people these days so quick with the shouting...?

<Ooishi>
"You don't want any more trouble, right?
 Tell me the bike license plate numbers.
 I'll bring them here for you.
 ...Kuma-chan, please borrow the loading truck we use for traffic disasters."

<Kumagai>
"Got it!"

<Delinquent>
"Iss, iss fine...!
 We'll get them ourselves!"

<Ooishi>
"Do you really want to get surrounded again?
 The police may not be fast enough to save you this time."

<Delinquent>
"............"

<Delinquent>
"It's fine, innit!?
 If we's surrounded, they gonna get knocked down!"

<Ooishi>
"Hey.
 You three...
 You're drinking the barley with foam, right?
 ...Try turning your engines on.
 I'll arrest you on the spot for drunk driving."

<Delinquent>
"...You... that's fuckin' dirty...!!"

<Ooishi>
"Your tax dollars will be put to good use in bringing all your bikes back here.
 Quit complaining and tell me the god damn license plate numbers, you pieces of shit."
The three were hesitant to tell him the numbers.
...They were mumbling something along the lines of not remembering them since they'd just bought the bikes.
......Well, that's what I thought. Hah~~...

<Ooishi>
"Kuma-chan.
 Go with the truck and bring the bikes back.
 Get the tough-looking red one, the one with the broken right tail light,
 and the white one that had the packing tape stuck to the seat.
 It's those ones. 

<Ooishi>
They belong to you, right?"
They didn't answer. Those must be the right ones.

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-san, the truck is here, so I'll get going."

<Ooishi>
"Yes, yes, please do.
 Wait, Kuma-chan, hold on. One more thing."

<Kumagai>
"What's up?"

<Ooishi>
"Look up the numbers.
 You don't want to bring the wrong ones back."
The three people's faces changed color.
...They made themselves very easy to understand.

<Ooishi>
"Let's take it easy here until your bikes get back.
 There's more beer, you know.
 We have some snacks, too.
 Want to watch TV?
 There's probably nothing on, though."

<Delinquent>
"Nah, thanks, we's leavin'.
 Don't wanna hang here forever!"
Suddenly, there were five or six huge officers surrounding them.
Their clearly overpowering stares nailed them to the sofa.

<Delinquent>
"...Wha... What?!!
 Whaddid we do?!!"
Going on a trip by stealing motorcycles, huh?
 ...Students these days have too much time on their hands.



[Watanagashi tip - 06]

<Shion>
"...Stop saying 'it's been a while'!
 We've seen each other every day up until yesterday, haven't we?"

<Keiichi>
"...Whatever.
 If you say so, we'll go with that."
Someone from Shion's house came to get me in a station wagon.
I had initially refused, but Shion insisted, and so both my bicycle and I ended up stuffed in the car.
Said car was currently driving across the single bumpy road leading to Hinamizawa.
For goodness sake... Shion was at Mion's level at least, or maybe an even better actor—either way, no matter what questions I pressed her with, she'd slip out of them like an eel.

<Keiichi>
"Still... you two look so alike.
 If you tied your hair back like Mion does, would you look exactly like her?"

<Shion>
"Who knows?
 That's probably what would happen.
 We're identical twins, through and through.
 In the past, we could just change our clothes and no one would be the wiser. 

<Shion>
I remember we'd swap places at every opportunity and fooled a whole lot of people. Ahahaha!"
The middle-aged driver wearing a black suit heaved a heavy sigh, like he were a butler.

<Shion>
"What's wrong, Kasai?
 That was a pretty deep sigh."

<Kasai>
"Excuse me.
 ...I was just thinking that you haven't changed."
You could see many years of hardship on the man's face through the rear-view mirror.

<Shion>
"Anyway, Kei-chan, your house was around here, right?
 Kasai doesn't know much about Hinamizawa aside from the road that goes to the Sonozaki main house. 

<Shion>
If you leave it to him, he'll take you all the way to Yagouchi."

<Keiichi>
"I-I don't want that!
 ...Excuse me, could you stop at the narrow road at the next right?
 I'll walk from there."
He stopped the car at the desired place.
The driver, Kasai-san, got my bike out of the trunk for me.

<Keiichi>
"Ah... Sorry about that.
 Thank you very much for showing me home today..."

<Kasai>
"Was it Kei-san?
 Your name, that is."

<Keiichi>
"Eh? Ah, yes."

<Kasai>
"...You must be having various difficulties, but I believe she will grow tired soon, so please endure things until then."
He gave me a deep, deep look of sympathy.
...This guy has definitely been dealing with the Sonozaki sisters ever since they were little kids.

<Kasai>
"However, like Mion-san, she's a kind person at heart."

<Keiichi>
"...So that means she'll be as much of a bother as Mion, right?"
The man's face froze in a smile, his reply lost.
 ...Hey, back me up here.

<Shion>
"Bye, Kei-chan! We'll see each other again soon.
 Say hi to my sister for me, too.
 Maybe I'll start going to Hinamizawa tomorrow?"

<Keiichi>
"Don't you dare.
 If you transferred in, I'll transfer out to a school in Okinomiya."

<Shion>
"Wow, that was really mean, Kei-chan...!"
A short beep of the horn.
 The man gave a little wave to me from the driver's seat.
Then, the car withdrew into the dark night roads, leaving dust in its wake...
.........Man... this entire day made no sense.
...I ran into Mion while I was with Shion, and the former's expression, like a pigeon shot with a pellet gun, had finally begun to make a strong impression on me.



[Watanagashi tip - 07]
<Oyashiro-sama's Curse>
In the ancient Onigafuchi Village, the anger of Oyashiro-sama (his curse) was feared above all.
However, it is seldom stated anywhere what eventually happens, and what sort of divine judgement (curse) befalls them when Oyashiro-sama is angry.
From various reports...
 "All hell will break loose"
 "Demons will come flooding out"
 "The miasma from Hell will flood outward and kill every villager, letting not a single one escape" 
The ones evoking images of the village being annihilated stand out the most.
These terrifying ideas of divine punishment are in alignment with many other religious beliefs regarding the apocalypse (Hell), and it's easy to imagine that they are just ways of convincing people to obey the teachings in order to prevent such an end.
The conditions for inciting Oyashiro-sama's wrath are likely the same as the taboos in Onigafuchi Village.
I believe that when an act was performed that violates one of these taboos, Oyashiro-sama was termed 'angry,'
 and in order to quell his anger, they would perform the aforementioned sacrificial ritual.



[Watanagashi tip - 08]
<The Human Sacrifice Ritual>
The sacrificial ritual was a simple drowning, involving plunging sacrifices into Onigafuchi Swamp, which was considered hallowed.
Of the rituals of Onigafuchi Village, this one was unique in that the sacrifice would sink slowly over the long course of three days and three nights.
I believe that it wasn't so much the killing of this sacrifice that was important,
 but rather the symbolism of them sinking as the 'submerging' of Oyashiro-sama's anger.
For that purpose, they must have had a passion for learning various methods for keeping the sacrifice from sinking too quickly—to force them to sink more slowly.
Unfortunately, as far as I can tell from the records, those methods were not recorded.
My thoughts are that they may have used logs or some similar material to create a raft,
 then set up a scaffold on there, hung the sacrifice up with ropes, and let them sink little by little over time into the swamp.
However, if that were the case, it would not be strange if the 'ritual implements' used for such a ceremony were honored as holy and enshrined somewhere.



[Watanagashi tip - 09]
<Implements Used For the Ritual>
Ritual tools utilized for ancient religious ceremonies are commonly referred to as 'implements' or 'ritual implements,' and even now, some of them are enshrined on the property of Furude Shrine and the Three Families.
However, the identifiable tools are all decorative, and none appear to have been used in rituals governing the dark side of Onigafuchi Village.
As the Edo era came to a close and many traditional rituals were lost, were they lost as well,
 or perhaps buried in the darkness?
I don't believe so.
Both the implements used on the night of the feast of Onikakushi and those used during the sacrificial ceremony must still exist, enshrined away from the eyes of the masses.
Without a doubt, they exist here, today, at this very moment, in Hinamizawa.
Also, I'm nearly certain where they've been enshrined.
What was once locked steadfastly has, for some reason, changed this year to a cheap-looking padlock.
 He may be able to do something about such a lock.
However, it is not far from the assembly hall, nor is it ever far from the presence of people.
However, I will not give up.

...The night when it becomes a blind spot to every villager in Hinamizawa is coming soon.
Soon, it will be
 Watanagashi.



[Watanagashi tip - 10]
*rabble* *rabble* *rabble*...

<Komiyama>
"Hey! Are you worn out already?
 Tomorrow's the real thing!
 We're gonna be partying until morning, until the very end of it all, got it!?"

<Kumagai>
"Got it!
 I'll give it everything I've got!"

<Komiyama>
"Wa-ha-ha!
 All right, then! Youth is the greatest!"

<Detective>
"Good work, everyone!
 Tomorrow is Watanagashi at last.
 Let's get some shut-eye in and save our energy for tomorrow night!"
Tomorrow was finally Watanagashi.
Festivals are split into two groups: those who enjoy them, and those who support them.
The former only need prepare their minds, but the latter needs not only that, but also painstakingly crafted plans and preliminary arrangements.
While the general majority attending goes about enjoying the festival without a care in the world, we'll be strained the whole way through.
 ...Why?

<Detective>
"You sure as hell know why!
 Because the beer after everything's over is the best damn beer you'll ever have."

<Komiyama>
"Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"
At times like these, it's best to have energetic, physically fit people!
It wouldn't be worth it if you didn't do your best until the end, enjoying it the whole way!

<Kumagai>
"Oh, he's here...!"
Ooishi-san came in.
 Everyone hurried to stand up.

<Ooishi>
"Hello, everyone. Excellent work out there.
 Ah, you can be at ease."

<Detectives>
"""Thank you, sir!!"""
Not even my seniors, who usually talk big about themselves, can hold a candle to Ooishi-san.
We all bow as if we were one of those cheering squads of old.
Kuraudo Ooishi.
A detective just waiting to retire—one who doesn't pay much mind to rules and regulations, and doesn't do too much in the way of real work.
He looks like a rotten old man with a penchant for dirty jokes.
 My seniors, though, tell me he was a real fighter in his younger days, and that he may or may not have quite a heroic legend trailing behind him...
...Anyway.
 He surely had much more dignity and presence in the room than the section chief who came in with him.

<Ooishi>
"Everyone, I really, really thank you for your hard work on the preparations for the festival tomorrow."
Everyone present stands upright and lends their ear to the chief's directions.

<Ooishi>
"We're on heavy alert for any thrill-seeking criminals expecting another incident like last year.
 I need all of you to focus your energy as much as possible in your mission to prevent any crimes from happening."

<Detectives>
"""Yes, sir!"""

<Ooishi>
"Of course, it would be best if nothing happened.
 ...However, everyone.
 Please assume that an incident will, in fact, occur. 

<Ooishi>
Prevention is number one, but it probably won't be enough.
 This year, too, someone will die, and someone will disappear.
 There's really no doubt about it.
 ...Nfu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu!"
Everyone, apart from the section chief, smiled painfully.

<Takasugi>
"Ooishi-san... that won't do!
 We need to be more serious about this..."

<Ooishi>
"The important part isn't to get past the night of the festival.
 ...It's to be able to quickly, swiftly, and aggressively pursue whatever does happen tomorrow night. 

<Ooishi>
I won't tolerate anything less than your best!!
 Clench those cheeks!!
 We're gonna rip all the skin off the ghost of Oyashiro-sama's curse!!!"

<Detectives>
"""Yeaaaaahhh!!!"""



[Watanagashi tip - 11]
<Watanagashi>
The rite of Watanagashi is performed during a village festival every June even now, but reading back to its origin turns up a seriously sanguine ceremony.
Originally, Watanagashi would happen at certain intervals, and after receiving Oyashiro-sama's trust, they chose a sacrifice. 
Then, the entire village would kidnap (demon away) the person and ceremonially dissect and devour them in a feast.
(The rules that determined the intervals are shrouded in mystery.
 This is because the ceremonies occurred extremely irregularly. 
There's a theory that it was determined based on astrological fortune-telling, but it isn't too convincing.)
The residents of ancient Onigafuchi Village firmly believed that they were half-man, half-demon transcendents, and that they were more valuable than humans were—and they forced people within and without to accept that.
Perhaps the act of kidnapping and eating people was done to prove that they were higher up on the food chain.
This is just a hypothesis, but maybe the rite of Watanagashi was a political event for the purpose of being an outlet for (or outright diverting the attention of) the villagers of the isolated Onigafuchi Village, 
in case any of their complaints or dissatisfactions grew serious.
If that was the main reason these ceremonies were held, then it's easy to explain how erratic they were.



[Watanagashi tip - 12]
<The Alleged Importance of the Implements>
I can't find anything that gives a concrete description on what the ritual implements were like.
They were, however, real, and there definitely existed a multitude of different kinds.
One source states that the implements used in the Watanagashi rite alone numbered two hundred.
The obvious question, then, is why they required such a myriad of them.
The rite of Watanagashi was to kidnap people through the 'demoning away,' dissect them, and eat them.
I believe the tools were for dissection and restraining, but two hundred of them is far too many.
Generally, tools evolve in such a way as to reach a solution for a certain problem.
Once you've reached the ultimate goal—that is, attained a certain level of efficiency—the tool's evolution normally stops there.
Regardless, why would they have created so many different kinds?
One of the cultural elements responsible for diversification over time is that of entertainment.
Tools used for entertainment would evolve over time and branch out.
Unlike normal tools, reaching the ultimate goal would be more of a dead end, and in searching for the next goal, they would split into many different subtypes.
So then, perhaps it's not a stretch to suggest that these two hundred-plus implements had some entertainment value.
This is just a hypothesis, of course, but maybe the human dissection process was viewed as a type of entertainment.
The Three Families of old would develop one new implement (dissection tool) after another, and each was varied, novel, and attracted spectators to keep them from growing bored...
 It's not unimaginable.
All of them have to be enshrined within that storehouse.
There isn't much longer until the night of Watanagashi.
Though its original intent has been lost, I will reveal the secrets of the traditional ceremonial night within the ritual storehouse.
...I can't restrain my excitement.
Watanagashi cannot come soon enough.



[Watanagashi tip - 13]
Late that night, tensions in the police station were strained.
In the silence, many of the staff members' eyes shifted back and forth between the clock and their telephones, counting the seconds in that stifled atmosphere.
Kumagaya-kun burst in with a young guy trailing behind him.

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-san, I've got the autopsy results!
 The court physician just got here!!
 I'm ready to go, sir!!

<Kumagai>
"You don't mean... like 4 years ago...?!"

<Ooishi>
"Kuma-chan, things have gotten a bit complicated.
 They appear to be having a very difficult time determining who the victim is."

<Kumagai>
"You don't mean... like 4 years ago...?!"

<Ooishi>
"Nope.
 Cooked to a nice, light brown."
He spoke in sportive tones, but the meaning behind his words was heavy.
...The staff gave a collective sigh.

<Kumagai>
"All the way? Head to toe...?"

<Kumagai>
"You don't mean... like 4 years ago...?!"
Cooked, with no possessions.
 Then, discarded outside the prefecture...
At worst, it would have taken a week for the body to be identified.
...The fact that they'd sniffed it out tonight was huge.

<Ooishi>
"Komiyama-kun and a few others are performing a thorough night raid on the dentist in Okinomiya.
 All we can do is hope a tooth matches some medical records.

<Kumagai>
"You don't mean... like 4 years ago...?!"
The young guy answered in affirmation and darted out into the hallway.

<Kumagai>
"You don't mean... like 4 years ago...?!"

<Ooishi>
"Then why not bury them,
 or sink them into the Sea of Japan, or Lake Biwa, or somewhere like that?"

<Kumagai>
"...Why, though?
 ...Hasn't the pattern so far been one person dies, and another disappears?"

<Ooishi>
"Kuma-chan, the corpse was inside an oil drum, unrestrained, and cooked.
 They probably burned them after strangling them.
 They knew it would be found."

<Kumagai>
"So what you mean is... from the beginning, they didn't want a person to disappear this year?"

<Ooishi>
"Not so much that as they just aren't related.
 The person didn't disappear—in fact, whoever did it seems to have wanted to make a show of it."

<Kumagai>
"You mean... it could be a warning?"
He folded his arms... and then heaved a long and heavy sigh.

<Ooishi>
"That might have been the case had it happened in town.

<Ooishi>
...If they'd messed up, taking the victim far away and burning them alive wouldn't have been noticed.
 If they meant it as a warning, they should have done it closer to Hinamizawa.

<Ooishi>
...They wanted to emphasize the fact that they killed the victim, but instead of doing it somewhere for dramatic effect, they did it outside the prefecture.
 Did they want to emphasize it or hide it? 

<Ooishi>
......Boy, I do wonder what Oyashiro-sama is up to this year~"
A telephone ring cut through the heavy silence.
 A staff member nearby snatched up the receiver.

<Detective>
"Ooishi-san!
 It's Komiyama!!
 They have it!
 The dental clinic in Okinomiya fixed the wisdom tooth three years ago!!"

<Ooishi>
"What about the records?!"

<Detective>
"Complete with X-rays!"

<Ooishi>
"Well... I feel bad for waking up the dentist before dawn.
 Kuma-chan, get out there as soon as you get the records from Komiyama-kun."

<Kumagai>
"Will do!!"

<Detective>
"Oh, it's the Chief!!
 Thank you for coming out at this hour!"

<Takasugi>
"Ooishi-san, my apologies for my lateness.
 What's the situation?!"

<Ooishi>
"Hmm... Well, it's just getting good, you see.
 We're all getting fired up!
 Waa~o♪!!"

<The Significance of Watanagashi>
Watanagashi—a festival of hunting for sacrifices and feasting on them.
While the festival itself is remarkable, it has come to be considered a form of entertainment as well.
(Perhaps it was because of the disparity between being both an egregious act and a form of entertainment that the perpetrators began to believe themselves transcendent.)
However, I found some very interesting literature that appears to raise questions about that explanation.
As with most oral traditions, it's not easily swallowed, but it does mention a few things that spark my interest.
According to this literature, even the residents of Onigafuchi Village felt fear towards this ritual.
Women and children would grow pale and tremble, and those of weak constitution would vomit—but it said that the feast (the dissection) was an obligatory viewing.
This is an extremely curious tale.
Until now, I'd thought that the residents of Onigafuchi Village were fascinated by the Watanagashi ritual.
They looked down on those vulgar, barbaric humans, cut them open like fish,
 and by eating them, they reaffirmed their own holiness... at least, that's what I thought.
However, if what the villagers gained from this ritual was not fascination, but fear, then that would suggest the ritual meant something entirely different.
There's the possibility that the executions were meant as warnings, encouraging the villagers to strictly follow religious precepts created by those with power for their own convenience.
Onigafuchi Village has been effectively ruled over by three old families, called the Three Families.
Without investigating the Three Families, I probably won't get any closer to the truth of Onigafuchi Village.



[Watanagashi tip - 15]
<The Three Families>
"The Three Families" refers to the three old families who effectively came to rule Onigafuchi Village.
To break it down, there was the Kimiyoshi family, the Furude family, and the Sonozaki family, and each of them still exists today.
(Though they don't have as much control as they did in the remote past, they still hold considerable influence today.)
The Three Families are considered by legend to be those in whom the blood of the swamp demons runs the thickest.
<The Kimiyoshi Family>
The Kimiyoshi family appears to have held great power as the head of the Three Families, but it doesn't have that kind of leadership today.
The current mayor of the village (Kiichirou Kimiyoshi) is from this family.
The fact that members of the Kimiyoshi family are elected as mayor every generation is thought to be a remnant of the old system.
Of course, as no rival candidates appear, it doesn't change the fact that the Kimiyoshi family holds the mayoral office even through popular elections in the post-war era.
<The Furude Family>
The center of the village's faith since ancient times, the Furude clan has guarded the sole shrine dedicated to Oyashiro-sama.
They were worshipped as the only people to represent the voice of Oyashiro-sama for a long time, but the family branched off after the war and lost most of its power. It now consists of only the main house.
The main house, as well, presently consists of only one daughter (Rika Furude), so the lineage may end in this generation.
There is apparently an old tradition of honoring females of the Furude family, so the only daughter, Rika, is the subject of much respect among the elderly of the village.
<The Sonozaki Family>
It's said that this family had a certain police-like role of protecting the religious precepts of Onigafuchi Village.
Of the three families, their relatively weak position can be seen from me putting them here last.
Of course, today, the Sonozaki family is flourishing, and the state of affairs among the Three Families has completely reversed.
Even now, one could say that they are in control of Hinamizawa.
The three families conferring with each other is similar to the old way—the current head of the Sonozaki family, Oryou, essentially decides all of the goings-on in the village by herself.

<Kimiyoshi>
"Excuse me for the late call...
 I'm Kimiyoshi—is this the head of the household?
 ......Yes!
 No, not at all. Thank you very much for that.
 Yes.
 .........Well, you see.
 ...I do apologize for calling at this hour, 

<Kimiyoshi>
but I was wondering if our old man was visiting you at the moment.
 ......You've got that right!
 Yes!
 Once again,
 I'm very sorry for calling so late.
 Goodbye."
Click.

<Woman>
"So?
 No good?"

<Kimiyoshi>
"I'm not sure what to do...
 He may be passionate about it, but he always at least gives us a call!"

<Woman>
"You called everyone he plays Go with, didn't you?"
Briiiiiing...!!

<Kimiyoshi>
"Hello!
 This is Kimiyoshi."

<Mion>
"This is Sonozaki.
 How did it go?
 Have you found the mayor?"

<Kimiyoshi>
"Oh, Mion-chan.
 ...I called everyone I could think of, but I came up with nothing.
 We can't find him...
 What do I do...?!
 Where could he be idling about...?"

<Mion>
"I put a word in with a bunch of people who might have had an idea...
 but nobody did."

<Kimiyoshi>
"............"

<Mion>
"I asked Nana about it, and she said we should get the men of the village together to search for him."

<Kimiyoshi>
"A-At this hour...?
 I mean, it's not like he's definitely gone missing..."

<Mion>
"Watanagashi just happened.
 She thinks we should be a little more cautious.
 If we still can't find him, then we'll notify the police tomorrow morning. 

<Mion>
Whether or not we find him, though, we should refrain from making any false accusations."

<Kimiyoshi>
"...Oryou-san said that?"

<Mion>
"Yes.
 If you can't trust her without hearing her voice, then I can put her on for you."

<Kimiyoshi>
"N-No, that's fine...!
 I understand.
 We'll get the men together and search.
 If we still can't find him... then we will notify the police in the morning."

<Mion>
"She'll leave it to you to organize the men.
 I'll be there as well, as Nana's representative."

<Kimiyoshi>
"Th-Thank you.
 I'll get everyone together immediately..."

<Mion>
"Thanks.
 I'll talk to you later."



[Watanagashi tip - 17]
<The Three Families In Modern Times>
As previously described, the Three Families' council today is a mere shell of democracy—in reality, it is a dictatorship run by the Sonozaki family.
Both the Kimiyoshi and Furude families are far from their former glory, and it doesn't seem at all like they've maintained the ancient traditions.
Only the Sonozaki family has retained their glory from the past and has inherited many colorful traditions from the age known as Onigafuchi Village.
Even the most recent, verifiable example of Watanagashi that occurred at the end of the Meiji era seems to have been done under the orders of the Sonozaki family. 
(Refer to the Three Families genealogical tree from the late Meiji)
After the start of the Meiji era, the Sonozaki family wanted to push the development of Hinamizawa Village, so they took a strong role in leadership.
During the dam wars a few years ago, the Kimiyoshi family served as the chair of the opposition alliance, but this was in name only—in actuality, the Sonozaki family reigned as leader behind the scenes.
People whisper that perhaps the Kimiyoshi family dictated acts of opposition that could be publicized, and the Sonozaki family enacted those which could not.
Even in Hinamizawa, they whisper that the multitude of unsettling incidents reported during the dam protests (such as the kidnapping of the famous Head of the Ministry of Construction's son) had been carried out by the Sonozakis.
Additionally, they say that perhaps the Sonozaki family's secret maneuvering was responsible for the serial freak death incidents that have continuously occurred in recent years as well.
The serial freak death incidents are without a doubt the second coming of the traditional 'Watanagashi.'
They must be enacting the Watanagashi on the day of the original Watanagashi, which has fallen to the level of an ordinary village festival, in order to remind the villagers of the holy laws of Onigafuchi Village.
It's safe to assert that exploring the Sonozaki family is the fastest route for researching it today.
If I can expose the contents of the Furude Shrine's storehouse, I'd like to narrow my research target to the Sonozaki family next.
The Sonozaki house is strictly guarded by security cameras on the premises, but thankfully, I've become acquainted with the sisters Mion—the next heir—and Shion.
I want this to be a breakthrough I can connect to my next line of research.



[Watanagashi tip - 18]

<Ooishi>
"No, no, don't worry about it.
 You see, when you order the oden here...
 for some reason, it ends up on the annual invoice for our gas contracts.
 So don't be shy and have another drink."
The man, red-faced, waved his hand to say that he'd had enough, and disappeared into the brilliant neon lights in front of the station.

<Ooishi>
"...Kuma-chan, you should be taking notes.
 The most modest people are the ones who live the longest. Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"

<Kumagai>
"Was all that... true?"

<Ooishi>
"Well, I don't know about that.
 Whether or not it's true, I think there's meaning in hearing something that sounds so plausible."

<Kumagai>
"...Would something like that be a motive to go for the mayor...?"

<Ooishi>
"Kuma-chan, here's what I always say.
 The motive only has to be enough for the person in question.
 You need to think about how different people value different things.
 ...Hey, bartender,
 give me another mug."
Though we have been suppressing the information, Tomitake and Takano's deaths were already known throughout Hinamizawa.
All of the rumors pointed to them having incurred the wrath of Oyashiro-sama for setting foot in the forbidden temple—the storehouse for ritual implements.
According to the rumors, there were two other people who went in there with them.
 ...Shion Sonozaki...
 and Keiichi Maebara.
People were whispering in the shadows that those two would be cursed by Oyashiro-sama as well.
Apparently, however, the responsibility didn't fall solely on the four trespassers' shoulders.
Until last year, it was locked up tight, but this year it had been changed to a simpler lock—hadn't that been what allowed thieves to enter so easily?
...Those were the rumors going around.

<Ooishi>
"Have you ever seen it, Kuma-chan?
 I remember it well—I had to go there for something quite a while back."

<Kumagai>
"Sorry, I don't really remember."

<Ooishi>
"It was locked up so tight it was scary.
 There were these real heavy bars holding it shut.
 It was sealed up as good as a bank vault."
This year, it was a very simple and cheap padlock.
......The lone girl protecting the shrine, Rika Furude, disliked the heavy locks, and consulted with the mayor...
 who had replaced it with a simpler padlock.

<Kumagai>
"...So then the mayor and Rika Furude share the crime...?
 So... then, after the mayor, wouldn't Rika Furude be in danger next?!"

<Ooishi>
"There's a decent possibility.
 ...Kuma-chan.
 I want you to contact all the cars we have in Hinamizawa.
 Tell them to stick near the Furude Shrine."

<Kumagai>
"G-Got it!!!"



[Watanagashi tip - 19]
<The Sonozaki Family>
The one to drastically expand its influence after the war was the Sonozaki family.
The leader at the time was Oryou Sonozaki, who still has that seat today.
Oryou Sonozaki has grown old, and today you can only catch a glimpse of who she was at the time.
From what I've been told, however, she was a leader extolled as the best in history.
Having become so old, aside from going out a few times a week for lessons, she spends her time at home in solitude, and seems to leave most of the ceremonial affairs to her heir, Mion.
(There are different views on why the successor was not her daughter, but her granddaughter Mion, but it's rumored that it has to do with disownment of her daughter and son-in-law).
That uninhibited granddaughter, Mion Sonozaki, still shows no signs of the dignity required of the next leader.
However, she does have Sonozaki blood in her veins, and is permitted the name of 'demon.' 
She still doubtlessly requires caution, and is probably hiding her fangs and claws (as skillfully as the leaders of the past did).



[Watanagashi tip - 20]

<Kumagai>
"Yes. The postal worker hasn't seen anything either.
 ...The Sonozaki main house has their seal hanging from their mailbox so that anyone can stamp their mail or parcels with it and drop it in."

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha, that's rather careless of them.
 ...So when was she last seen?"

<Kumagai>
"She was last seen at the Watanagashi opening ceremony greetings.
 She apparently returned home right after that."

<Ooishi>
"Well, she is pretty old.
 ...From what I've heard, she goes out a few times a week to take lessons, right?
 Have you found anything out about that?"

<Komiyama>
"Every Monday she goes to the assembly hall to practice the taishougoto, but she didn't go this week."

<Ooishi>
"Any calls to say she wasn't going to be there?
 Has anyone confirmed it?"

<Komiyama>
"No, nobody.
 She apparently takes days off once in a while, though, so no one thought it was strange."

<Ooishi>
"Tomorrow, why don't we pretend we're the town hall and call around ten o'clock?
 Please figure out whether she's at home."

<Kumagai>
"Ten o'clock? Got it!"
Ever since it started to seem more and more like ancient Hinamizawa traditions had something to do with all this, he'd been keeping a careful eye on the Three Families.
At this point, the leader of the Kimiyoshi family and the leader of the Furude family had disappeared.
There was only one leader left.
Oryou Sonozaki, the leader of the Sonozaki family.
She was apparently a pretty old woman.
Her dignity hasn't waned, but she still only appeared before people rarely, so it was difficult to confirm where she was at any given time.
...She, the last leader, hadn't been seen since the day of Watanagashi.
Was she still alive and well within the Sonozaki main house?
 ...Or had she...?

<Kumagai>
"According to Mion Sonozaki, she had fallen ill and was sleeping it off."

<Ooishi>
"I wonder if she's really sleeping.
 I'd like to take a look at her face—and her pulse..."

<Kumagai>
"............You can say that again."
The two of them breathed out a big puff of cigarette smoke...

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-san... About the search warrants for the Sonozaki main house and the Furude shrine.
 Do you think we'll get them?"
Ooishi didn't respond, exhaled another cloud of tobacco smoke, his surroundings now as foggy as his mind...



[Watanagashi tip - 21]
<The Hidden Demon>
The inhabitants of Hinamizawa believe that the blood of demons flows in their blood. As such the character for 'demon,' 鬼, is treated as very sacred.
For example, usage of the character 鬼 in names is apparently a right reserved for only the leaders of the Kimiyoshi and Sonozaki families.
Case in point, we can see it in the current Sonozaki family leader's name—Oryou—is written with the character 魎.
This, and only this, is proof that she is a legitimate leader of the Sonozaki family.
In the same way, Mion Sonozaki, its successor,
 contains 鬼 in her name, with 'Mi' being written as 魅.
It also goes for Oryou's daughter and Mion's mother, Akane, who did not succeed her. 
It's known that before the disowning, Akane's name was actually written as 蒐, though it was changed afterwards to 茜 (still read as 'Akane').
Incidentally, it's thought that the first character the mayor Kiichirou's name, 喜, originally meant 'demon,' which can also be read as 'ki.'
It should be said that names using the character 鬼 aren't limited only to successors of the Sonozaki family.
You can even find it in the last names of the Three Families.
For example, the characters for 'Kimiyoshi,' 公由, are likely a split-up version of 鬼. If you write it in reverse and top to bottom, as 由公, it clearly resembles the character 鬼.
As for the Furude family (古手) who have been in the Shinto priesthood for generations—the word for 'fortune-teller' can be written, without interval characters, as 占手. 
I think that with the addition of a demon's horn—the tick on the top of the character 鬼—the 占 became the 古 that is used in their name now.
In the case of the Sonozaki family, where Sonozaki is written 園崎, I can't find any reference to the character 鬼, perhaps because it's already ingrained into their first names.
They were the clan responsible for running the Watanagashi ceremony, so I think that instead, they included the contents of that ceremony into their last name.
The 'zaki' in 'Sonozaki' is a conjugation of the word for 'slice,' and the 'sono,' written as 園, probably contains the hidden meaning of 'human body,' as it is a complicated mess (organs) enclosed by four sides.
I think, in other words, that 'Sonozaki' comes from 'those who slice open the gut.'



[Watanagashi tip - 22]

<Detective>
"I'm back!!"

<Ooishi>
"How did it go?
 Did you find any clues?"
...The officers shook their heads in disappointment.
Exhaustion was plainly showing on everyone's faces.
That was only natural.
 None of them had gotten a wink of sleep since the day of Watanagashi.

<Ooishi>
"Chief.
 Let the youngest of us take a nap, and then switch them out.
 We've got a long stretch ahead of us, after all.
 Let's not push ourselves too hard—rest up so we can take it easy as we go."

<Takasugi>
"I've been telling them to sleep in shifts.
 Nobody actually seems willing to sleep, though.
 ...Could you tell them yourself, Ooishi-san?"

<Ooishi>
"Oh my.
 You don't need to force yourselves.
 Komiyama-kun.
 Please let everyone sleep in shifts, starting with the youngest."

<Takasugi>
"Komiyama-san.
 Please do that."
After the chief told him as well, Komiyama-san left his seat.

<Ooishi>
"So, Chief.
 Still no good on our request?"

<Takasugi>
"...It's just a rumor among the villagers in the first place, you know?
 It's going to be difficult without more concrete evidence."

<Ooishi>
"Even when that evidence might be tucked away in there?"

<Takasugi>
"We need evidence that evidence is tucked away in there...!"

<Ooishi>
"Chief~
 Don't start speaking in riddles to me, now.
 We have witnesses that say four people, including the two who died, went into the forbidden ritual storehouse without permission! 

<Ooishi>
This is all reliable information."

<Takasugi>
"You might call it information, but they're really only rumors. They're not concrete evidence."

<Ooishi>
"Well, it's true that we don't have any pictures of the four of them sneaking in with cloth tied around their heads. 

<Ooishi>
Anyway, those four saw something inside the storehouse!
 Something important enough that they'd be erased!"

<Takasugi>
"Important enough that they'd be erased? What would that be, exactly?"
...That's why I'm asking for a warrant to go looking for it in the first place...!

<Ooishi>
"Anything pointing out the Sonozaki family's connections to the black market would be a major contender.
 Like guns or contraband.
 The secret Sonozaki family fortune would also be pretty difficult to discard."

<Takasugi>
"...Look, Ooishi-san, I know how you feel!
 However, that storehouse is a sacred building belonging to the Furude Shrine, and we need to have proper consideration for the locals when dealing with it."
I heard that there was an hour long call made from Congressman Sonozaki to the big man.
 ...Chief, could he have nailed you back down?

<Takasugi>
"Anyway!
 As long as we don't have suitable evidence, we won't get a search warrant for the storehouse.
 That goes for the Sonozaki main house, too! 

<Takasugi>
Especially considering that's the jurisdiction of both Section 4 and the prefectural police's crime prevention division.
 We need careful preparations first!"

<Ooishi>
"...If you say you need preparations, then why don't you just let me talk with them directly?
 Shige-chan is the head of Section 4, right?
 For crime prevention, it's Sankai-san. 

<Ooishi>
They seem like they'd be quicker to talk if I sat them down at a mahjong table."

<Komiyama>
"C-Chief, you have a visitor...!
 Um... yikes!"
Pushing the employee who guided him in right out of the way was an old man who looked like a yakuza member, given his crested kimono and hakama.
 ...Did he not get enough of this over the phone?

<Sonozaki Representative>
"I am Congressman Sonozaki!!
 I demand to know who's responsible for this!!!
 This instant!!"

<Takasugi>
"H-Hello...!
 I am the division chief, Takasugi!!"

<Sonozaki Representative>
"I don't need YOUR name!!
 I could have you demoted on a whim!
 You wouldn't even be enough!
 Bring out the one called Ooishi or whatever!! 

<Sonozaki Representative>
He deserves punishment for requesting a search warrant on the sacred Furude Shrine!!!"

<Takasugi>
"I-I sincerely apologize...!
 O-Ooishi is currently out on investigation, and he's been difficult to contact... I'll take his place and hear you out...!
 S-So please, have a seat!"
The chief's eyes were telling me to get out of here.
...Perhaps I'll gratefully accept this favor...
 Maybe I'll go lay down in the nap room.

<Sonozaki Representative>
"Listen here!! The Furude Shrine spent 2600 years under the imperial calendar and 2500 more beyond that! It is sacred! A sanctuary that must never be defiled!! 

<Sonozaki Representative>
The eight hundred thousand gods, Oyashiro-sama, and the spirits of our ancestors are enshrined there.
 The holy shrine protects Hinamizawa from when the sun comes up to when it sets, and from when the moon rises to when it falls. 

<Sonozaki Representative>
Who is the idiot who wanted to set foot in there?!?!

<Sonozaki Representative>
Besides, the right to religion is the most revered right of the people of this country in the constitution!!!
 You dare to be so bold as to sully that using your own investigation's negligence as pretext!!? 

<Sonozaki Representative>
I cannot—I will not allow it!!!
 Are you listening, you lying scum?!
 I'm angry now, so you're not getting off the hook that easily!!!"



[Watanagashi tip - 23]
<The Problem With Twins>
This is not limited to just Hinamizawa, but in Onigafuchi Village especially, the Three Families detested giving birth to twins as successors.
The long-term dictatorship built on the precarious balance of the Three Families must have feared collapsing under the weight of internal strife from things like family quarrels.
According to the literature, if twins were born, then they had to be culled.
With that, the very fact that both the Sonozaki family successor, Mion Sonozaki, and her twin, Shion, are alive is in itself deeply interesting. (Perhaps the current leader, Oryou, is sympathetic?)
Of course, the twins were not cared for equally, and as the heir, Mion received special treatment.
(From what I've heard, despite the two of them looking exactly the same on the outside, the talent lies solely with Mion.
 ...My own observations of the two of them don't leave me with that impression).
Tradition dictates that the leader of the Sonozaki family is said to 'inherit a demon,' and they tattoo a magnificent one onto his or her back. 
In accordance with the tradition, there is an extremely high possibility that Mion has such a tattoo on her back.
From what I've heard, there is apparently a magnificent demon tattooed on Oryou's back as well.
Then... I wonder what sort of tattoo belongs to the heir, Mion.
...I really want to see her back.

<Master>
"Heya, Kura-chan. You're the last one here~
 All the youngsters are here already."

<Ooishi>
"Na-ha-ha-ha...
 Excuse me, miss."
Ooishi handed over a convenience store bag with a carton of cigarettes in it to the old lady who owned the mahjong parlor, and she shrewdly made herself scarce.
 ...She was used to this by now.

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-san!
 Good work today!!"

<Ooishi>
"What, were you all earnestly waiting for me?
 You could've just done three-player."
Everyone sitting at the mahjong tables in the small parlor were Ooishi's subordinates, but there were no tiles laid out anywhere.

<Ooishi>
"Everyone, I'd like to thank you for your days of investigation without sleep."

<Detectives>
"""Thank you!!"""
Energetic responses filled the parlor.
 ...Already, it had lost the atmosphere of a place of entertainment.

<Ooishi>
"The situation is not looking good.
 The chief appears to have backed down due to Congressman Sonozaki's threats.

<Ooishi>
"This always happens, but incidents are a lot like locking your keys in the car.
 The keys you need to unlock the door are always locked inside.
 For cars, you call the repairman and they'll pry open your door. 
...That damn upstart chief.
 The veterans in the room cursed him.

<Ooishi>
"All of our requests for warrants were turned down as well.
 I've even been told by our section chief not to go anywhere near the Sonozaki house.
 ...We're certainly in a bind, that we are.

<Ooishi>
Incidentally, it looks like I'll be getting orders soon to go to training at the Metropolitan Police Department starting next week.
 After that I've even been told to take a paid vacation in Izu. 

<Ooishi>
...Well, I suppose that ain't bad~"
He heard a few dry laughs.
 ...It wasn't anything to laugh about, but that was all they could do.

<Ooishi>
"This always happens, but incidents are a lot like locking your keys in the car.
 The keys you need to unlock the door are always locked inside.
 For cars, you call the repairman and they'll pry open your door.

For incidents?

Kumagai flipped over the whiteboard.
 On the back was a map of the Sonozaki premises made with magnets.

<Ooishi>
"Now, I've been doing this job for a looong time.
 I've got a lot of faith in my gut, but this could be the one time it was wrong, no? 

<Ooishi>
Anyone worried about their retirement money has until the count of ten to get out of here."
Ooishi began to count to ten, and everyone counted along with him.
......It was their famous ten-count resolution.

<Ooishi>
"Nine, ten!!
 Ah, no one's leaving.
 None of you love your families too much, is that it? Nfu-fu-fu!"

<Detectives>
"""Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...!!"""
Everybody laughed uproariously, cheering things up.

<Ooishi>
"I want everyone to go over their materials.
 Memorize the locations and blind spots of all the security cameras.
 Kuma-chan, you'll stand by in the command car. 

<Ooishi>
If something happens, you'll switch with me and take over.
 Komiyama-kun will head up Infiltration Team A.
 Atsushi-kun will lead team B.
 Observation teams will set up at points one through eight. 

<Ooishi>
Bonchi-kun, you're responsible for keeping a strict timetable.
 Control your rotations so HQ doesn't get wise.
 Now, the team on standby has the most important job, all right?
 If the section chief asks where I am, play dumb."

<Detectives>
"""Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!"""

<Ooishi>
"I'll handle escorting our guest.
You can be sure I'll bring 'em to the venue, so wait patiently, everyone."

<Kumagai>
"...Wonder if he'll cave?
 Keiichi Maebara, that is."

<Ooishi>
"From what I've seen, we're set for tomorrow or the day after in that regard.
 It'll be easy.
 Nfu-fu-fu-fu!"
