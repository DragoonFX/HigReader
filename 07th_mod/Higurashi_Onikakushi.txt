[Onikakushi Prologue]

If I was going to be ripped apart anyways,
 having my body ripped apart would've been far better.
I trusted her.
...No, I still trust her.
Even in this very moment, I trust her.
But... I'm starting to realize.
I only wanted to trust her because I refused to accept the truth.
It was as if I was trying to convince myself,
 in such a silly... sobbing voice...
And those tears... those tears making a mess of my face...
That mechanical, repetitious sound finally stilled, and everything fell silent.
Only the cry of the cicadas remained, annoyingly loud.
And yet...
...I felt as if I could still hear her voice.
...But that's not possible.
She is no longer speaking.
The only one crying is me.
She never cried.
Even when she repeated those words over and over, she never expressed any emotion, because there were none to show.
If she had no tears to shed for me,
 then I...
 shouldn't need to shed any for her.
Then why... this pain, my eyes getting moist... why was this happening?
I still wanted to believe... I hadn't been split apart.
That's enough, right?
Inside me, an inner voice whispered gently...
My spirit had suffered enough...
...and countless times I'd wavered over whether I should just throw the battered thing away.
Except... I've stubbornly refused to do that, haven't I?
I'd feel better if I just threw it away.
Even knowing that, I chose to believe, didn't I?
Only I can understand that painful struggle, and appreciate it.
Hey, me?
...I've tried more than enough.
...I'll acknowledge that much.
So...
...Isn't it all right to just take the easy way out?
Besides... I'm not throwing it away.
I'm leaving it behind, with her.
...Like flowers by a grave.
Now then.
...Calm your nerves.
Even though you can't feel your right arm.
...Just lift it up.
And with every swing, forget a little more.
That kindness made me happy.
That adorable smile brought me joy.
I liked petting your head.
I loved how demure you were.
...Because this will be the last time.
Because when I swing this down, I'll forget.
This is... my...
First and last...
 bouquet for you.
Perhaps... I really did...
...
...love you.



[Onikakushi Ch.0]

...Somebody has been apologizing for a while now.
I wonder what she's apologizing for.
It felt wrong to eavesdrop, so I tried to ignore it.
It had been a while since I'd last went to the city. I only returned to attend the funeral of a relative.
Even though I'd lived there until last month, I found the bustle of the city to be overwhelming.
Those skyscrapers and the multi-lane roads.
The melodious cacophony of the crosswalk.
Even the campaign speeches blaring in front of the station felt nostalgic.
The place where I live now isn't nearly as lively.
There's only the chirping of locusts and the babbling of brooks.
 And the cry of the higurashi—the evening cicadas.
Rather than making me feel lonely, that quietness had begun to instill a sense of serenity.
There is nothing where I'm living now.
I don't just mean there aren't any burger joints. There aren't even vending machines.
No music stores, no restaurants...
 and no arcades.
An ice cream parlor? No chance.
The nearest town has some stuff like that, but it's an hour away by bike.
But come to think of it, it wasn't really a big deal.
There were music stores and arcades and ice cream parlors where I used to live, but it wasn't like I ever hung out at any of them.
I had lived in the city for ten years and never once been to an ice cream parlor.
...I should have gone at least once.
It's only now that I'm starting to regret that a little.
...Somebody is still apologizing.
Who is she apologizing to?
She's apologized so much, so just forgive her already.
There's no reason anyone should ever need to apologize so much.
I started to feel a bit annoyed at whoever was refusing to forgive her.
No matter how bad the mistake, there's nothing that can't be forgiven.
There's no such thing as an irreparable mistake.
You just need to be more careful next time.
...She's still apologizing, even now.
Then... has she really done something that can't be fixed?
I have no idea what she's done, but if it can't be fixed, then that's all the more reason to forgive her.
No matter how much she apologizes, nothing will change.
But even so, she keeps apologizing in such a heartbreaking voice...
Hey, you. The one she's apologizing to...
Why don't you just go ahead and forgive her?
She's apologizing... in such a pathetic voice...

<Keiichi's dad>
"Keiichi, we're almost there.
 Wake up."
I was finally roused from my nap by my father's prodding.
It seemed the train had reached its final stop.
We'd spent hours riding everything from the bullet train to the local routes.
It was hard to believe that the landscape beyond the window and the city I was in half a day ago were in the same country.
No... that they were even from the same era.
From there, we'd take a car deeper into the mountains.
Past where the dense forest encroaching on the mountain road suddenly opened up...
There, where I live now. Hinamizawa.



[Onikakushi Ch.1]

Even though we were approaching summer, the morning air still had a frigid bite.
Although, in exchange, you could fill your lungs up with crisp, clean air.
Flipping open the window, I was greeted with a verdant expanse.
Nothing but trees.
The neighboring house was far away on the other side.
So I was probably the only one enjoying that view and that air.
I filled my lungs with another deep breath.
Since I started living in Hinamizawa, I learned that even air had its own taste.
I quickly finished getting ready for school and headed downstairs for breakfast.
My mother was the only one there. My father was nowhere to be seen.
He was probably up working until the early morning.
Dad had a rather unconventional job as a painter.
It's such a laid-back profession.
Get up when you want, sleep when you want, and work when you want.
I was so jealous of that easy-going lifestyle,
I even wrote for school that I wanted to be a painter when I grew up. Dad was ecstatic about that.
It was just because it looked easy. I'd never tell him that, though.
Mom laid breakfast out on the table.
Seaweed, pickled vegetables, raw egg, and grilled salmon.
My mom was such a good cook, it was scary.
A perfect, immaculate, ideal breakfast.
Unlike my dad, who didn't even know the meaning of the word "schedule," my mom never squandered any time or effort.
She hummed a little tune as she brought over the miso soup. It seemed like she was in a good mood today.

<Keiichi's mom>
"I'm so happy you've been waking up early since we moved here, Keiichi."

<Keiichi>
"If I don't get up early, I don't make it in time for your early breakfasts!"
I thought I was being cute, responding with a wise-crack after being praised for being good.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Full bowl of rice? Or will half be enough?"

<Keiichi>
"Pile it on."
First, I savored the steaming hot rice with the seaweed.
 After that, I covered it with the egg.
Between bites of rice, I enjoyed the crunch of the pickles.
Not bad at all.
 Excellent, as usual.
Watching me clean my plate, Mom gave me a warm smile.

<Keiichi's mom>
"I'm so happy you haven't skipped breakfast ever since we moved here, Keiichi."
I was not a morning person when we lived in the city.
I slept right until the last minute before school and rarely ate breakfast.
Boycotting the breakfast Mom made me each morning... that was probably the only way I could protest being forced to attend cram school.
...I guess that was what you'd call my rebellious phase.
I wouldn't so much as look at the breakfast she woke up early every day to make.
If I could go back in time, I'd slap myself.
Mindful of the time, Mom rushed me along with a wide grin.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Isn't it about time to meet up with Rena-chan?
 Hurry, hurry."
Mom really seemed to enjoy the fact that her son was going to school with a girl.
Rena is one of my classmates.
She really loves looking after people, coming to meet me every day without fail.
The way I looked at it, a guy my age walking to school with a girl was just lame...
But, well, keeping a classmate waiting for me every day wouldn't be very considerate.
...Seriously, though, how long does Rena wait there for me every morning...?
Taking one last gulp of miso soup, I raced for the door.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Please thank Rena-chan for the pickles~!"
Come to think of it, those pickles weren't store-bought, were they?
...If I'd known that, I would have savored them a bit more!

<Keiichi>
"Mornin'!"

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun~!
 Good morning~!"
Her cheerful greeting was as fresh as the morning itself.

<Keiichi>
"You're always so early.
 You should try sleeping in sometime."

<Rena>
"If I sleep in, I'll keep you waiting."
...She's so conscientious, and such a good person.

<Keiichi>
"If that ever happens, I'll just leave you behind."

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, you're so cold.
 I wait for you all the time..."

<Keiichi>
"I'll leave you in the dust.
 Without looking back."

<Rena>
"Why are you so mean?
 ...Why?"
Rena had a slightly troubled look on her face.
Toying with her was rather fun because of how quickly her mood changed.

<Keiichi>
"I'm kidding. I'd wait for you."
With those words, Rena seemed to relax.
Her face flushed bright red.

<Rena>
"...Ah ...Th-Thank you..."

<Keiichi>
"I'd wait forever until you came, Rena.
 No matter how long."

<Rena>
"...Ah-ah, ah...
 ...For...
 Forever..."
Rena turned bright red, steam rising from her head as her brain short-circuited.
She's especially weak to this sort of talk.
It's quite rare to find someone this fun to tease.

<Keiichi>
"Have you ever read a romance novel, Rena...?"

<Rena>
"...Huh...
 ...Ah ...I haven't.
 N-Never read any before."
From that response, I gathered she was interested in them but was too embarrassed to actually buy one.
I couldn't imagine what would happen if she did read one.
She'd probably turn red and pass out...

<Keiichi>
"Oh, yeah, message from Mom. She says thanks for the pickles."

<Rena>
"I-It was nothing. You're welcome~.
 How were they?
 Not too salty?"
They weren't that salty.
Actually, they had a pretty light flavor to them.
...It would have been fine to just be honest and say they were good, but apparently I couldn't be that forthright.

<Keiichi>
"...I'd like to ask something before that.
 Were you the one who pickled them, Rena?
 Or was it your mom?"

<Rena>
"Huh?
 ...Huh? Why do you ask?
 Were...
 Were they too salty...?"
Her attitude completely changed as she began to panic frantically.

<Keiichi>
"Was it you, Rena? Or was it your mom?"

<Rena>
"...Wh-Why are you asking who made them?
 ...Why!?"

<Keiichi>
"Depending on who made them, my opinion of them might change drastically."

<Rena>
"...Huh, huh uh...!?"
She counted frantically on her fingers, trying to remember the amount of salt she'd used to pickle them.
...It wasn't like I was trying to tease her, but I couldn't stop myself.
Guys who take pleasure in this kind of thing are probably the worst.
 ...Guys like me.
Rena nervously opened and closed her mouth over and over, trying to muster a response.

<Rena>
"...I-It was me..."

<Keiichi>
"Delicious."

<Rena>
"Huh?"

<Keiichi>
"Pretty good, just like the last ones. They went perfectly with the rice."
Her face went bright red again.
 She was completely spacing out.
It truly was a lot of fun to tease her.
I pray that Rena never gets taken advantage of by some lowlife.
Keep at it, Rena. I'll train you until you handle it like the average person!
 ...Or so I decided for myself.

<Keiichi>
"Let's go! If we keep Mion waiting, we'll never hear the end of it."
Seeing as she'd just keep spacing out otherwise, I called Rena back to reality so we could make our way to school.
This strange, easily flustered girl is Rena Ryuugu.
I've only known her for about a month, but I've come to realize it's not just her name that's strange.

<Rena>
"Mii-cha~n! Good morning~!"
Coming up to the next rendezvous point, we saw another person waiting for us.
 Noticing us, she waved.

<Mion>
"Ah, finally, finally. You two are late~!"

<Keiichi>
"Usually, you're the one who's late!"
In sharp contrast to the diligent Rena, this one marched to the beat of her own drum.
She's Mion Sonozaki.
For what it's worth, she's our senior and head of the class.

<Mion>
"Morning, Rena. And it's been a while, Kei-chan!
 How many years?"

<Keiichi>
"I was only off two days!"

<Mion>
"Ah haha!
 You don't say.
 You were such a cute little tyke the last time I saw you!"
Mion then lowered her hand to about 1 meter above the ground.

<Keiichi>
"But you've only known me for a month..."

<Mion>
"You've grown up so magnificently...
 All the trouble this old man had to go through was worth it."
She gently took out a handkerchief and pretended to weep into it.
Just what is she trying to pull off at 8 o'clock in the morning...?

<Keiichi>
"Wasn't it me who went through the trouble there?!"

<Mion>
"You've grown up so much, you even have a beard~!"

<Keiichi>
"My beard hasn't started growing yet!"

<Mion>
"No, it's already growing. You got yourself a razor for it last week, right?"

<Keiichi>
"That was my father's... Wait, how do you know that?"
Mion sneered at the question, and then wagged her index finger right in my face.
...Just what is she playing at?

<Mion>
"Hahaha, NEVER underestimate Mion-san's intelligence gathering skills!
 From your last meal to Rena's measurements, this old man knows it all."
My interest piqued, I placed my hand on her shoulder while she was still smirking.

<Keiichi>
"...I'll bite, what are Rena's measurements?"

<Mion>
"Just as I thought, you really want to knoooow?
 By the way, it's expensive~ How much would you pay?"
Catching on to our awful discussion, Rena became flustered and began to ramble in a near panic.

<Rena>
"...Hey,
 hey hey...
 What are you talking about?
 What're you talking about!? What're you talking about...!!"
Red-faced and flustered, Rena tried to play dumb, but it was obvious she knew exactly what we were talking about.

<Mion>
"How was it?
 Seeing the city again."
Mion switched gears, dropping the dirty talk and changing the topic to something more befitting the pleasant morning.

<Keiichi>
"I only went for a funeral. I didn't have much time."

<Mion>
"So yeah! Did you look for it?
 ...That thing I asked for?"

<Keiichi>
"You're... not listening... at all.
 I just came back from a funeral!
 I didn't have any time to look around in toy stores!"

<Mion>
"Tsk tsk tsk.
 Toy stores and hobby shops are completely different, you know?
 It's really difficult to get western stuff around here, after all."

<Rena>
"Is this about games again, Mii-chan?"
Mion nodded proudly as Rena giggled.

<Mion>
"Yep! I wanted Kei-chan to bring me back a 'west port' catalogue, you see."
"West port" was short for "western imported games."
Using that abbreviation did make it sound pretty geeky.

<Keiichi>
"You can just get them to send you one in the mail, can't you?"

<Mion>
"Well, guess I have to now.
 I'm going to get another game full of hot action!"

<Rena>
"...Th-This time, I'd like a game that's easy to understand..."
Mion is a board and card game enthusiast, and I hear she's collected quite a lot of different ones.
According to Rena, Mion's room has kind of become a museum for domestic and foreign games.

<Keiichi>
"If there's a game you think I'd understand, let me play too."

<Mion>
"Heh... of course!
 If Kei-chan is up for it. I should warn you though, we're pretty tough."

<Keiichi>
"Just what I want.
 I play all sorts of games. I don't intend to lose!"

<Rena>
"...Whoa...
 Then we'll let you in the group this time, I guess.
 ...I guess!"
Bristling with joy from head to toe, Rena looked back and forth between me and Mion.
Mion gave her an affirmative wink, and her expression perked up even further.

<Mion>
"I thought boys preferred playing outside more, so... I figured you wouldn't want to."
Rena laughed happily.
From such a friendly conversation, you wouldn't think I had moved here less than a month ago.
I understood that they did all they could to make a transfer student like me feel at home.
I'll have to try harder to fit in, so they won't feel like they have to try to make me feel welcome.
I felt like if I acted a bit more open than I usually am, it should probably be about right for this place.
Hinamizawa was a really small village. Not only was there only one school, but there was only one class.
That class encompasses all different grades and ages.
There are about 30 students at different levels, and they all study in the same class.
I'm told that, long ago, there used to be a bigger school building and they had actual separate classes.
However, it seems something happened that made it become a single class, and now it stayed that way out of tradition.
I was shocked at first, but humans adapt pretty quickly. I've already gotten quite used to it.
The sound of children playing started right from the morning.
With such a lively mood, it felt more like a kindergarten than a proper school, not that that was a bad thing.
Mion, who had been walking in front of us up until then, suddenly let me take the lead.
Right in front of the classroom door.
So I was meant to slide the door open and enter the room first.
Heh...
 Too bad. I wasn't going to fall for that again.

<Keiichi>
"...To think you'd give up the lead here.
 You meant for this to be a test of my skills."
Mion chuckled with a haughty smirk on her face.

<Rena>
"Wh-What is it... you guys...?"

<Keiichi>
"Step back, Rena. It's dangerous.
 ...She's here!"

<Rena>
"Huh...?
 Then... Satoko-chan is...!?"
Her name was Satoko Houjou.
She was a disrespectful, impudent, bossy kid.
The way she talks was annoying, but it would be immature to get worked up over just that.
The real problem... was this...

<Keiichi>
"...Quite the obvious trap. A blackboard eraser wedged in the door.
 ...It's too obvious! Satoko!"
A haughty laugh came from beyond the door.

<Mion>
"Excellent, Kei-chan! ...I guess that means you win this round?"

<Keiichi>
"...No, this is Satoko we're talking about.
 I doubt this is it..!"
After falling for such intricate traps since the day I transferred, I no longer let my guard down.
Satoko liked to combine a variety of traps: traps that were simply there to bait you into the main one, traps that relentlessly kept coming at you like a sadistic Rube Goldberg machine, the list goes on.
As well as being clever, they almost never misfire.
When you least expect it... she strikes!
No escape. No time to relax.

<Keiichi>
"By the looks of it, this eraser is normal.
 No rocks or anything in it."
I took a pretty heavy hit from a blackboard eraser loaded with rocks on my first day.

<Rena>
"So then why don't you just open the door and let it drop...?"

<Keiichi>
"That's what it is!"
That's what Satoko was after.
Making me focus my attention upward. So as I lifted my hand to the door...
There were thumbtacks stuck to the sliding door handle with tape; a frightening trap.
A potent and terrifying trap.
Concealed by using the blackboard eraser...

<Keiichi>
"An impressive combination, Satoko!
 But in the end, nothing more than the trivial machinations of a child!"
Assured of my victory, I threw the door open and stepped into the room.
I felt something strange at my ankle.
 It was similar to the sensation of a jump rope catching on my leg.
By the time I realized she had me—hook, line, and sinker—it was already too late.
I began to fall in an almost picturesque manner.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, watch out!!"
Instinctively reacting to Mion's shrill warning, I twisted my body in midair before I landed on the floor.

<Keiichi>
"...Ow ow... ow!?"
An ink stone, filled to the brim, was placed right where I would have landed...!
I shuddered, imagining the situation had I landed square on it.

<Satoko>
"My, my, what do we have here?
 A fair morning to you, Keiichi-san. Aren't we a lively one this morning~!"
Still sprawled in an awkward position, I was greeted by a mocking voice.

<Keiichi>
"That was a step up from your usual traps, Satoko!!"

<Satoko>
"I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
 You're quite unlucky this morning."

<Keiichi>
"You little~...!!
 ...
...
...Owowow..."
It seemed I'd inadvertently sprained my back a little when I'd landed.
 ...Better than landing on that inkstone.
A small hand gently rubbed my head.

<Rika>
"...Pain, pain, go away."
The small, dainty hand continued to gently stroke my head.

<Rika>
"...You didn't sprain your back or anything, did you...?
 If you rub it like this, the pain disappears..."
I thought about asking how rubbing my head would help my back, but I didn't.
It's not so much about what you actually do, it's the thought that counts.

<Keiichi>
"Y... Yeah, thanks Rika-chan. The pain's going away now."

<Rena>
"Yay~! ...Rika-chan! Good mor~ning!"

<Rika>
"...Good morning to you, Rena.
 A good morning to all."
Rika-chan greeted each of us with an adorable little bow.
It was infectious. Rena, Mion, and I all bowed back.

<Keiichi>
"You're such a good kid, Rika-chan...
 So much better than Satoko...!"
I glared over in her direction. Satoko was whistling while rather deliberately trying to avoid eye contact.

<Satoko>
"I am the very model of a good girl."

<Keiichi>
"A good girl wouldn't set those nasty traps!"

<Satoko>
"Nothing but lies and slander!
 Exactly what proof—
 ...Uwah!"
I picked up Satoko by the back of her collar.
 She looks like a misbehaved cat when I do this.
But a cat wouldn't be setting traps.
...She's much harder to deal with!!

<Keiichi>
"I-M S-O-R-R-Y.
 Try saying that.
 If you won't say it...!"
I cocked my index finger on my thumb, letting it tremble as I brought it closer to Satoko's forehead.

<Satoko>
"I-I'm against violence!!
 You don't even have any proof!!"

<Keiichi>
"Just so you know, my forehead flick really hurts.
 It can split plywood right in half!"

<Satoko>
"Eeeeeeeek...!!!!
 Stop! Get away from me, you beast~!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Don't say that in a way people will misunderstand!!"
A small hand tugged on the back of my shirt.

<Rika>
"...She's been lonely since you were gone for two days."
...Rika-chan really is just so...
How could I do anything more after being told that?
I gently released my grip on Satoko, who at this point was on the verge of tears. She still had her eyes clamped shut as she braced herself for the forehead flick.

<Satoko>
"...U-Uwaaaaaaa...hnn!!
 It doesn't bother me!!
 Uwaaaaahn!"

<Rika>
"...You mustn't cry, Satoko.
 Keep on fighting,
 yeah."
Rika gently petted the head of her prankster friend.
You would never guess those two are the same age.
I think Satoko could learn a thing or a million from Rika-chan.

<Rika>
"...Next time, set an even more amazing trap."
...Waiiit a minute...
As she observed the scene, Rena's expression grew ecstatic as she began to swoon.

<Rena>
"...Hau~... Satoko-chan is crying...
 Sho kyute..."

<Mion>
"You can't take them home."

<Rena>
"...Huu!
 ...But, but... they're sho kyute?"

<Mion>
"You can't, no matter how 'kyute' they are."

<Rena>
"But... just for a bit... is fine?
 Is fine?"
Rena kept a cutesy face even as outrageous ideas spewed from her mouth...
According to Mion... Rena is ridiculously weak to cute things and always tries to take them home.
Object or person...!

<Keiichi>
"Stealing is bad, but abducting people is even worse.
 Give it up."

<Rena>
"Then I can just look. Just looking...
 that should be fine, right? Right?"
Rena swooned over Satoko's crying form.
If a girl ever goes missing in Hinamizawa, I'll be forced to turn Rena in to the authorities.
Forgive me, Rena.
I'll be sure to bring you care packages when they put you away!

<Mion>
"The teacher's coming.
 Quickly, clean everything up!
 Satoko! That inkstone is yours, right?"
Just from Mion's single statement, the entire mood of the room shifted back to normal.
The inkstone was bad, but the thumbtacks stuck to the door handle were an even bigger problem!
I pulled the tape off carefully, making sure not to skewer myself.
Even though Satoko was the one who set it up, everyone had to pick up after her.
By the time the teacher entered the room, the bedlam from before had been neatly tidied up.

<Mion>
"Ahahaha, we made it in time!"

<Mion>
"Rise, attention!"
Mion gave out the morning commands.
It's difficult being the teacher for all these different grades in one classroom.
She has to teach something different to each one.
But naturally she ends up spending all her time with the younger kids.
Rena and Mion, being in the highest grade in the class, end up mostly doing self-study.
They even end up helping teach the younger kids, so it seems like they can never get to their own studies.
They're actually way behind where my studies have progressed to.
As a result, I'm pretty much taking over for the teacher and helping Rena and Mion with their studies.

<Rena>
"You're a pretty good teacher, Keiichi-kun.
 Easy to understand."
Rena took a breather after finishing highlighting an important section.

<Keiichi>
"Teaching is making me lose confidence.
 It makes me aware of how shallow my understanding of the subject is."

<Mion>
"They say that to teach someone something, you need to understand it backwards and forwards.
 So while you're teaching us, you're getting in your own practice."
In contrast, this person over here is quite laissez-faire about things.
For one, isn't she supposed to be in a higher grade than me!?

<Keiichi>
"Look Mion, this is for your own good.
 If you don't take this seriously there'll be trouble later on.
 With these marks..."

<Mion>
"It's not like I'm aiming to go on to a prestigious school.
 I'll be fine as long as I pick up what I need to know for the entrance exams a little at a time!"
Her staunch defiance was really something else.
 This was a different type of relaxed than somebody who already knew what was going to be on the entrance exams.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, Keiichi-kun is doing his best to teach us.
 We need to try hard, too."

<Keiichi>
"You're such a good and honest kid, Rena.
 I'll make sure you guys get accepted into a good school."

<Rena>
"...Wh-Wha...
 Th-Thanks so much..."

<Keiichi>
"Especially you, Rena.
 Private lessons... just the two of us."

<Rena>
"...Pr-
 ...Private...le-
 lessons..."
A puff of smoke shaped like a halo...
 Popped out of Rena's head.
Exactly what kind of private lesson is she fantasizing about that's making her turn so red...?
I'd like to hear the play-by-play of that next time.
While Mion was flipping through her vocabulary flash cards, she threw out a casual question.

<Mion>
"So, in the city, do you have to study this much?"

<Keiichi>
"If you don't know at least this much you can't get into university."

<Mion>
"So you study just to get into a university?"

<Keiichi>
"Well...
 Yeah, basically.
 While knowing that this stuff won't ever come in handy in the future."

<Mion>
"Out here, you can get into university as long as your attendance is good enough."

<Keiichi>
"...R-Really...!?"
Study = Entrance Exams. Having that basic law of the universe so easily overturned sent me into a state of shock.

<Mion>
"That is right.
 There aren't really enough people around here to warrant weeding them out with an exam."

<Mion>
"If anyone can get into university, then there's no need to be all uptight about this stuff, right?"

<Keiichi>
"...Well, that's true... but you should at least know stuff that's common knowledge..."

<Mion>
"This old geezer thinks that, instead of wasting time studying pointlessly,
 you should be spending your precious teen years doing more meaningful things."
It was too profound of a statement to simply laugh off.
But since it was Mion, it probably didn't actually have that deep of a meaning.
In place of a chime, the sound of the principal waving a hand bell drifted through the classroom.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, we're done! We're done!
 It's our wonderful lunch time!"
In a complete 180 from her unmotivated state, Mion gave the commands that signaled the end of the morning period.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun, let's have lunch.☆"
I might have been making a very troubled face.
Rena smiled brightly at me.

<Keiichi>
"Awright!
 Let's eat!"
There seemed to be different cliques, even within the class.
Most of them were divided up by gender and age, but our group was different.
Our ages were different and we had both boys and girls.
But we weren't reserved around each other.
This level of openness makes a transfer student like me pretty happy.
Rena and Mion pushed their desks together so they were facing each other.
At the same time, Satoko and Rika-chan were slowly lugging their desks over as well.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, hurry, hurry!"
Rena waved her chopsticks in an unrefined manner, trying to hurry me along.
Unless everyone was together, they wouldn't even open their lunch boxes.

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san's lunch box is most assuredly a plain, miserly rice and seaweed~!
 Why don't you just show it to us? Come now!"
Even though Satoko was hurling insults at me, she still wouldn't open the lid to her lunch box until I was there.
I pulled out my lunch box swiftly and dragged my chair over to join the circle.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, sorry to keep you waiting!"

<Rika>
"...Well then, Representative Mii, please give the signal to start!"
At first. this was kinda embarrassing, but I got used to it pretty fast.
At this point, I probably wouldn't even open my own lunch box if someone else was too slow.
Our ages and genders may have all been different,
 but we were all friends.

<Keiichi and others>
"""Let's eat!!"""
The sound of our little five-part chorus echoed beautifully throughout the classroom.
Really, though, I've gotten pretty used to this group made up of all girls.
Of course there are other boys in the class, but they were a lot younger, so they were scared to approach me.
Well, that's to be expected.
Younger boys just see older boys as scary.
Compare that to girls... Well, at least these girls aren't picky.
We put all the side dishes in the middle where everybody was free to pick at them.
I thought girls would mind sharing a meal with a guy, so I was a bit flustered joining in. However, Mion noticed that and teased me quite a bit.
As the fruit of my efforts(?), I can now reach over and take sides from anybody's lunch.

<Satoko>
"My, my. Isn't Sir Keiichi's lunch extravagant today?"

<Keiichi>
"My, my, isn't Madam Satoko's lunch extravagant as well?
 The stewed stuff has a nice look to it, rather trendy."
Buying into the fight that Satoko was starting, our chopsticks locked in a cross-counter, stabbing into each other's lunch.

<Satoko>
"My, how delicious!"

<Keiichi>
"Oh, this taro is good.
 The stewed stuff is good too, even cold!"
After seeing my happy face, Rika-chan's expression broke into a little smile.

<Rika>
"...I saved some from dinner last night."
By the way, Satoko and Rika-chan's lunches are always the same.
It seems that Rika-chan makes it for both of them every day.

<Keiichi>
"Rika-chan made this too?
 ...These taste like Mom's home cooking!"
I was honestly impressed.
The carrot rosettes weren't from a mold; they were done by hand with a knife.
That's not easy to do.

<Mion>
"I guess Rika-chan's just good at this sort of thing."

<Rena>
"She's really good at sewing, laundry, and stuff like that.
 Amazing, right?
 Amazing!"

<Satoko>
"Rika is quite exceptional in many ways.
 Ohhohohoho!"

<Keiichi>
"That's nothing for you to boast about!"

<Rika>
"...Rena's actually better at cooking than I am."

<Rena>
"...Huh,
 ah
 ...well... you know.☆"
It seemed that the topic of conversation switched to Rena when she wasn't expecting it, making her blush and trip over her words.
Rena's lunch really was the star of the table.
Not only did it look good, it tasted good!
Everyone else pulled from Rena's lunch box constantly.

<Rena>
"Everyone liked this one so much before, so I made a lot this time.
 ...It's good, I hope?
 ...I hope?"

<Keiichi>
"It's got high marks from me!
 Ah, Mion, you're taking too much!"
Knocking Mion's chopsticks aside, I reached out, trying to secure my own portion. Satoko and Rika-chan reached over at the same time and a struggle ensued.
Everyone shoveled in mouthful after mouthful while praising it, and Rena's lunch box was soon empty.
It was kinda bad that no one thought to leave any for Rena.
But Rena seemed rather satisfied as she looked on.

<Satoko>
"How did you like it? Isn't Rena-san an extremely good cook too?
 Quite different from Keiichi-san!"

<Keiichi>
"I said that's nothing for you to boast about!"

<Mion>
"You're not much different from Kei-chan, Satoko.
 Can you tell the difference between broccoli and cauliflower yet?"
Satoko's face went pale.

<Keiichi>
"...Hey, hey. Even I can tell the difference between broccoli and cauliflower, you know?"

<Satoko>
"O-Of course I can!
 ...I really can!"
It's really hard for her to lie.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, both taste good when they're boiled and topped with mayo, right?
 You shouldn't be picking on her...
 Mii-chan too!"
Rena hurriedly tried to follow up, but Mion laughed haughtily as she drew closer to Satoko.

<Mion>
"Well, well, just pretend it's a little home-ec lesson.
 ...Now then, Satoko...
 What's this?"
Mion lifted up her chopsticks. Between them was a piece of green stuff wrapped in bacon.

<Rika>
"...But that's... asparag...mngh."
Mion made eye contact with me and within .3 seconds, I had Rika-chan's mouth covered.
Holding a piece of bacon-wrapped asparagus and giving her two choices... She's pretty terrible.

<Satoko>
"Uum, well!
 Uhh...
 The yellow one is cauliflower... No, wait... the green one is cauliflower..."

<Mion>
"So which!? Hmm?"

<Satoko>
"Probably... the yellow one is broccoli and the blue one is cauliflower...
 But the green one is...
 um...
 uu..."

<Mion>
"Do you really know which is which? How about you just give up~?"
I'd expect no less from the class representative.
 The oldest.
 The way she drives people into a corner just shows how much experience she has.
This is just a hunch, but being brought into the Sonozaki household must be quite the ordeal...

<Satoko>
"I do know...!
 I really do!!"

<Mion>
"Then answer the question!"

<Satoko>
"...I know... I know...
...
 Uwaaaaaahn!!"
She finally broke down and started crying.
When she acts like this, she actually starts to seem her age.

<Rena>
"...Ha...
 Hau~... K-Khyuute..."
Rena entered a state of euphoria as Satoko bawled her eyes out.
Rena was in a state of bliss as she rubbed her cheek against Satoko's head and smothered her.
...Really... a very content face.
One that wouldn't care if the world ended right then—it was that kind of smile.

<Satoko>
"Rena, Rena~!
 MiiMii is picking on me-!
 Uwaaaaahn!!"

<Rena>
"Khyute khyute...!
 It's okay, Rena-oneechan will take care of all those bad people who tease my little sister!"
FWISH BOOF BAM!!
It was like a flash of lightning.

<Keiichi>
"...What...
 was that...
 just now...?"
Both of Rena's fists shot out at supersonic speed, striking Mion and me squarely in our faces.
Before we knew it, Mion and I were sprawled spread-eagle on the floor, staring up at the ceiling with matching welts on our faces...

<Mion>
"...This is the first time you've gotten one, right?
 ...Today...
 she went easy on us..."

<Keiichi>
"...E-Easy... You mean, there's something harder than this...?"
With that, Mion and I both slumped our heads back to the floor in unison.

From now on, I'll be careful when I'm within striking distance of Rena...

<Rena>
"See, Satoko-chan? I took care of them.
 ...Mmm, khyute~!
 I wanna take you home~!"
Making sure Rena couldn't see it, Satoko stuck her tongue out at us.
Tsk, damn it all~! Using Rena like a puppet!!
Rika-chan massaged our bruises without saying a word...
No matter what the day had held, the last school bell always came too soon.
Our shadows stretched off into the distance.

<Rena>
"Hey, Keiichi-kun. Tomorrow, do you have plans or anything...
 ...or anything?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh...?"
It was such a direct question from Rena I inadvertently blushed.
I-If it was for a date, then wouldn't you do it more subtly??
Rena saw me lost for words and realized that I'd misunderstood, and turned red as well.

<Rena>
"...Uh, ...ah, ...N-No, ...I didn't mean it like that... you see...!"
So apparently that wasn't what she meant.
But since it's always fun when Rena's in a panic, I went along with it a little.

<Keiichi>
"Oh, really... So... it wasn't meant that way..."

<Rena>
"Huh...!? Huuh!?"
Playing it up, I slumped my shoulders, feigning dejection.

<Rena>
"...K-Keiichi-kun, why are you so disappointed, why?
 Why!?
 ...Mii-chaaan!"

<Mion>
"...Pfft.
 Aahahahahahaha!!!"
Unable to hold it in any longer, Mion slapped me on the back.

<Mion>
"I see! This old geezer never knew you could push her buttons like that.
 Wahahahaha!!!"

<Rena>
"...Huh? ...Huh? What? What!? What is it!?"
Mion was rolling on the floor clutching her stomach while Rena flailed around, completely bewildered.
I couldn't help but start laughing as well. Feeling just a bit guilty, I ruffled Rena's hair.

<Keiichi>
"Kidding. Sorry, it was a joke... That was my fault."
She really is a cute one.

<Rena>
"...Huh? ...Huh? ...A joke? Since when!? Since when!?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh, ah... about halfway through."

<Mion>
"...Halfwaaay?
 So Kei-chan, that means you weren't acting when you blushed at the start?"

<Rena>
"...Huh...? ...Th-That means...?"
It was only a momentary lapse, but there was no way Mion would let such a delectable detail slip by her.

<Keiichi>
"Uh, well, you see..."
Saying anything more was also a bad idea...
In my bewildered state, I slipped further into an unfavorable position.
After that, Mion continued to tease me about it for a while...

<Keiichi>
"...So, why were you asking if I'm free tomorrow, Rena?"

<Rena>
"Huh...? Oh... What were we talking about...?"
It had been so long that Rena had forgotten. That's how long Mion had teased me.

<Mion>
"It's just, Kei-chan... you probably can't find your way around Hinamizawa by yourself yet, can you?"
That was true.
I hate to say it, but if you blindfolded me and spun me around three times like we're playing pin the tail on the donkey, I wouldn't be able to tell up from down here.

<Keiichi>
"...Yeah. I don't think I know how to get anywhere besides back and forth from school."

<Rena>
"Yes, yes. So you see, tomorrow, we were thinking that Mii-chan and I could escort you through Hinamizawa and show you around..."
That would be a godsend. Frankly, I was happy about the offer.

<Mion>
"You'll come of course, right?"

<Keiichi>
"If I'm free."

<Mion>
"You're being invited by a girl, you know!?"

<Keiichi>
"If I'm free."

<Mion>
"You're probably free anyways."

<Keiichi>
"If I'm free."
I was being stubborn so as not to give a clear yes or no.
Even though I thought it was a godsend, I'm too much of a scamp to say so up front.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun... you're not free, perhaps?
 ...Perhaps?"
While Mion and I had our rather sour back-and-forth, Rena peeked over at me hesitantly.
Figuring I'd been a bit too rough on her, I just gave in.

<Keiichi>
"...Sorry. Forgive me. I apologize.
 I'm free."

<Rena>
"...Great!"
The trepidation disappeared from Rena's face as it blossomed into a smile.

<Mion>
"Hey now, hey now!
 Seems like there's quite a difference between how cold you are to me compared to Rena, isn't there!?"
It seems Mion didn't care for how rude I was to her, compared to how quickly I agreed with Rena.
But her being annoyed was very interesting.
So I pushed Rena forward, speeding up our pace to leave Mion behind.

<Keiichi>
"Let's go, Rena.
 Maybe it should just be the two of us tomorrow, leave grumpy ol' Mion behind."

<Rena>
"...Huh,
 woah...
 If Keiichi-kun... is okay with that, then..."

<Mion>
"I'm the one who came up with the idea to take him around~!!
 Don't ignore me, Keiichi Maebara!!"

<Keiichi>
"It'd be great if the two of us could go on a picnic together! Should we bring a basket, Rena?"

<Rena>
"...I-If we're bringing a basket...
 I'll...
 make all the food, maybe...
 Maybe!"

<Mion>
"Don't you ignore me too, Rena! I'll put out a village-wide circular saying how you two are madly in love!"

<Rena>
"Well then... I'm going home right now to start making it...!
 Tomorrow is going to be so fun~! Later Keiichi-kun, Mii-chan! Bye!"
Rena bounded off like she was walking on the moon.
After the dust settled, all that was left was me standing next to Mion sprawled out on the ground. There was a welt on her face.

<Keiichi>
"...Are you all right...?
 There was over two meters between you guys..."

<Mion>
"...S... Since you came, they've become sharper...
 This old geezer's body can't handle it..."
...Maybe it'd be easier if you stopped saying stuff that makes Rena want to hit you...
Or else this will end up being Mion's Slapstick Comedy Hour.
If that happened, the results might be fatal...

<Keiichi>
"Don't feel bad, Mion. You're probably the only one who can dodge her jabs!"

<Mion>
"...It felt like it was her knee, though..."
...Could it be that we were hanging around with an unrivaled martial arts master?
Maybe someday we'll see her debut in an extreme contact sport...

<Keiichi>
"You can't lose to Rena! You need to train up and have a rematch!"

<Mion>
"Kei...
 Kei-chan, you should...
 This old geezer will root for you..."
Mion and I reaffirmed our determination to discover a way to counter Rena's infallible technique...



[Onikakushi Ch.2]

I took it a little too easy on the morning of my day off. I was totally late.
...And to top it off, that pesky mom of mine pushing a return-journey errand on me just as I'm trying to leave the house...
Today was the day Rena and Mion were going to show me around Hinamizawa.
Rena and Mion were already waiting at the meeting place.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, you're late!"

<Keiichi>
"S-Sorry, sorry! The show I was watching last night was really interesting! Blame that!"

<Mion>
"Ooh~ So that's your excuse for being late and keeping two girls waiting!?"

<Rena>
"...Mii-chan, you just got here yourself."

<Mion>
"Ahahahahaha~!...☆
 Last night's episode of 'A Day in the Life Of' was interesting, wasn't it?"
She was just as guilty as me.
Rena was carrying a pretty heavy-looking handbag.
What... is that?
Mion answered my unspoken question with a wink.
That's right. Rena really did make a picnic!

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, after you left...
 Rena pulled out all the stops!"

<Keiichi>
"It's not like I forced her to do it...!"

<Rena>
"...I-It was nothing...
 so don't worry about it...
 Okay?☆"

<Mion>
"She's been like this since last night, you know!?
 Can you take responsibility for this!?"

<Keiichi>
"All right, all right... I am a man, after all.
 I'll take responsibility."

<Rena>
"...Huh...?
 ...R-Re... responsibility...!? For what!? For what!?"
As we both turned around slowly to look at Rena, our gazes drifted downwards to the massive handbag she was carrying.
It didn't seem logically feasible that it would be entirely filled with lunchboxes.
...Except this was Rena we were talking about here!

<Rena>
"...
 About two kilos... I guess?"

<Mion>
"When Rena was picking it up, I could see she was struggling a bit...
 I say five."

<Rena>
"...You're exaggerating!
 Keiichi-kun is a boy, after all!
 I thought he could probably eat a lot, so... I made a lot... Okay?☆
 ...Ahaha... Let's get going!
 ...Heave ho!"
Just from the way she was lifting it up, I couldn't believe the only things in there were lunch boxes.

<Keiichi>
"...Correction. I say five kilos, too..."

<Mion>
"I'll help out. ...But all of it needs to be eaten!
 I won't forgive you if you make Rena sad, got it!?"
The only thing I could do at that moment was exercise a bit to make myself hungrier...
Having finished with the pleasantries, we began our leisurely stroll.
A care-free walk, bathed in the gentle morning sunlight.
I couldn't have even imagined something so wholesome existed during my time in the city.
These were the boonies, after all.
No slovenly desk jockeys trudging to work on the weekends out here.
It really was a nice place... peaceful and quiet.
As sparsely populated as the village was, you could still run into people just by walking around.

<Mion>
"Ah, good day."

<Villager>
"Good day.
 Oh, you would be... Maebara-kun, I believe?"
My two companions exchanged greetings with everybody we ran across.
All of these passersby even knew my name.

<Keiichi>
"When did I become this famous!?"
We passed three people and, when all three of them knew me, I started to feel a bit paranoid.

<Mion>
"Ahaha, it's a bit sad to say.
 Everyone knows everyone since there are so few people here in Hinamizawa."

<Keiichi>
"So that means...
 So that means when an unfamiliar face walks by, they automatically assume it's that Maebara fella who just moved here?"

<Mion>
"Yeah. That's how it works out."
It was a process of elimination you could only pull off in a place like this... but it was quite effective.
From now on, I'd better make sure to maintain a good reputation.
The day I'm discovered accidentally gawking at a dirty magazine in the bookstore... I can expect all the villagers labeling me as a letch by the next day...!
Hinamizawa is not to be trifled with...!
That's not the end of this nightmare.

<Rena>
"Of course I know them.
 The first person we met was old man Takezou from the Makino bike shop.
 His hobbies are bonsai and playing the flute."

<Mion>
"Next we met the grocer's second son, Daisuke-kun.
 His hobby is sharpshooting, and he hopes to be an ace sniper in the future."

<Mion>
"And the person we just met was Miyo-san, the nurse from the clinic.
 Her hobbies are birdwatching and photography."

<Keiichi>
"...You know the names of everyone we passed by...
 and even their profiles!?"
Seeing my surprise, Mion and Rena exchanged looks and burst into laughter.

<Mion>
"Well, yeah.
 We're not like the city, where people hardly know their neighbors."

<Keiichi>
"Then let's try it out.
 You there, who am I?"

<Rena>
"Ahahaha.
 You're Keiichi Maebara.
 You say some mean things but you're actually a kind, shy person."

<Mion>
"It's been three weeks since you transferred here.
 Your hobby is taking afternoon naps.
 Lately, you switched over to wearing boxers.
 ...Didn't you?"

<Keiichi>
"That's enough, that's enough!!"

<Rena>
"...B-Boxers..."

<Keiichi>
"Enough of that!"
Apparently there is absolutely nothing you can keep hidden here.
Hinamizawa was not a place to be trifled with!

<Keiichi>
"This feels more like you guys are showing me off rather than showing me around."

<Mion>
"That's right."

<Mion>
"We're parading around like this, after all.
 It'll give everyone a chance to see for themselves.
 That Kei-chan is fitting right in here in Hinamizawa!"

<Rena>
"The population in Hinamizawa is shrinking.
 ...So the villagers welcome anybody who's new here."
I thought about brushing it off with something to the effect of "You're kidding me," but I held back.
Had I ever greeted someone who'd just moved into the city like this before...?
Thinking about that made me believe what they said wasn't a joke at all.
We passed another person.
Of course, we were called out to again the same way.

<Villager>
"Oh my, good day.
 It's wonderful seeing you getting along!"

<Rena>
"This lady here is Fujishima-san.
 Good day~!"

<Villager>
"Oh my, Maebara-kun! How wonderful for you, having a lovely girl on each arm!
 How are you?
 Getting used to life here?"
Instead of regurgitating a prepared response like I would have in the city, I responded with an emphatic nod.
The old woman chuckled, voicing her appreciation of how energetic I was.

<Mion>
"Good!"
As I looked back over to Rena and Mion, they gave me a wink.

<Rena>
"...So, now then.☆
 About time to have lunch, maybe?
 ...Maybe?"
Rena's brilliant smile signaled the approach of an event that both Mion and I were trying to forget.
We both looked at each other.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm a man. I'll do what I can.
 ...But it's just too much!"

<Mion>
"...It's fine, Kei-chan. Leave it to this old man."
...Mion has never seemed as reliable as she does right now.
I'd expect no less from the Class Representative!

<Mion>
"Rena, if we're going to eat, we might as well go somewhere with a good view."

<Rena>
"...Uwaa... Yes!
 Good idea. I agree~!"
Rena nodded her head happily in response to Mion's proposal.
Cresting the top of a stone stairway, a shrine drawn straight out of my imagination appeared before us.
It had worn down a bit through the years, but the fallen leaves had been swept up, giving it a tidy feeling.

<Rena>
"This here is the Furude Shrine.
 It's probably the place with the best view around!"

<Mion>
"This place. Be sure to remember it!
 On our next break, a festival will be held here."

<Keiichi>
"Ahh. Isn't it a bit too early in the season for a festival?"

<Mion>
"The Watanagashi isn't a summer festival. Long ago, it used to be a celebration of the end of winter."
I was embarrassed for assuming that festivals had to be held in the summer.

<Rena>
"Now then... spread out the lunch boxes...
 and there..."
Various colored lunch boxes were placed one after the other on top of the plastic sheet.
It sure did smell delicious.
 It was Rena's home cooking.
 It went without saying that it would be delicious.
...But is it even possible to finish all of this!?
Hey, Mion! It'll take more than just a good view to get this all down, you know!?!?

<Rika>
"...Good afternoon."
It was Rika-chan and Satoko.
...Why are they here!?
Mion grinned over at me.
I-I see... this was her secret plan... the power in numbers...!
You have my thanks, Mion!
Following up when all the pieces are in place is my specialty!

<Satoko>
"We just had to come since there was such a commotion...
...
 What is the meaning of this!?!?"

<Keiichi>
"Take a look.
 It's time for lunch.
 Buffet style.
 A handmade gourmet meal by Rena."

<Satoko>
"I can see that much!!
 Why have you laid out a tarp on our property!?!?"

<Keiichi>
"The temple is public grounds. It's not yours."

<Rika>
"...Keiichi is right.
 This is everyone's property."

<Keiichi>
"Wow~... Rika-chan is such a good girl...!!
 Have a seat!
 Eat with us!"
After opening up a spot for Rika-chan, I promptly turned my back on Satoko.

<Satoko>
"Hold on one second!
 Where is my spot!?"

<Keiichi>
"No spot for you and nothing for you to eat!"

<Rena>
"...D-Don't worry... There's some for you, too..."

<Keiichi>
"None! I'll eat all of hers!!"

<Satoko>
"I will not allow that!!!
 Rikaa!"

<Rika>
"...Here, chopsticks."
Both Satoko and I leapt at the boxes, having it out with each other.

<Mion>
"Man, really... Kei-chan, you're really good at leading people on.
 ...You might have a talent for this."

<Rena>
"Have a plate. One for Mii-chan and Rika-chan, too."
Rena whipped out pairs of chopsticks and paper plates.

<Rika>
"...If we don't hurry, it'll all be eaten up."

<Mion>
"That's right. Okay!
 Shall we commence this battle!?"

<Rena>
"Please eat a lot!
 There's enough for everyone.☆"
Rena said, as she opened up a thermos.
Just then, I realized that this lunch was made under the assumption that five people would be eating.
It didn't change how much there was, but the implication behind it was different.

<Satoko>
"I will not allow you to have this hamburger!!"


<Keiichi>
"Hurk!!
 Using your elbow is against the rules, Satoko!!"

<Satoko>
"Grabbing the back of my collar is also against the rules!!!"
It was a tough battle. Blocking with her full momentum and an elbow in the opening moves, Satoko appeared to have the upper hand. But the difference in our proficiency with chopsticks proved to be fatal and gave me the upper hand!

<Satoko>
"Aaah! The last meatbaaaaaaaaall!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Satoko Houjou has been bested!!! NOM!!!!"
Satoko and I amiably began choking at the same time, falling backwards and spasming.
Rika-chan patted me on the head to clear it, even though it was actually stuck in my throat.
Seeing that made Rena blush and breathe heavily in excitement. It was almost like flowers were floating all around her.
Mion advised Rena to refrain from saying anything that could get her locked up.
This is how our meals usually go.
...I'd do anything in my power.
 Just so things could stay like this.
The intense battle calmed,
 and finally everyone reached a point where they could begin talking.
Receiving tea from the thermos, I let out a small sigh.

<Keiichi>
"I do wonder why there are so few words in Japanese to praise how something tastes!"

<Mion>
"Isn't it because the idea of togetherness during a meal didn't begin until the modern era?"

<Rena>
"It seems that, long ago, people ate in silence.
 ...It must have made the people preparing the food a bit sad, don't you think?"

<Satoko>
"It's probably because the people back then were so busy eating that they didn't have the time to compliment the flavor!"
That's just you.

<Rena>
"But, you know, just hearing that it's good makes me happy.
 ...That my effort was worth it, I mean."
She blushed a little as she said that.

<Rika>
"...It was delicious."
With absolutely perfect timing, Rika-chan struck Rena directly with "praise."
She looked straight at her with an expression of bewitching innocence.

<Rena>
"...Auh..."

<Keiichi>
"...Auh?"
After Rena uttered an unintelligible noise...
 A ring of smoke rose from her head with an audible "poof!"

<Rena>
"Hau~!!
 ...Ri... Ri-Ri... Rika-chan, I-I'm gonna take you home... No, I mean...!
 Thank you!!!!"

<Rika>
"...It was really delicious."
Rena flushed red with excitement, embracing Rika-chan and rubbing her cheek against her so hard you could almost hear it.

<Rena>
"T-To reward Rika-chan for her praise... Ta-da!
 These are special!"
Two apple rabbits! After sticking toothpicks into them, she thrust them toward Rika-chan.
After Rika-chan accepted them, the mood suddenly shifted in a bizarre way.

<Keiichi>
"...What is it, Satoko?
 What's with that defiant look?"

<Satoko>
"Has everyone prepared proper praise to receive apples from Rena-san?"

<Mion>
"Don't push yourself.
 What kind of praise can you think up with your weak vocab!?"

<Satoko>
"Hohoho... Well then.
 Allow me to show you."
After Satoko flashed Mion and me a defiant look, she changed the tone of her voice suddenly.

<Satoko>
"Uh... Um, hey!
 ...So, Rena-oneechan's lunch? Satoko thought it was yummy, too..."
Satoko looked up at her poutily while talking cutesy.
Wha!
 ...How was that praise!?
 That's not even persuasion by tears, that's persuasion by cuteness, isn't it!?
This is a Rena-limited special skill.
She blushed and her head spun, waving around in circles...!!
D-Don't fall for it, Renaaa!!!!

<Rena>
"...Aw... hau!!"
Of course, that was asking for the impossible. Rena glomped Satoko and began rubbing her cheek against her.

<Rena>
"Kyuuuteee!!
 ...Satoko is so... kyute...☆ ...take you home...hau!"
Swish,
 stab!
 Push!
 Satoko was also presented with apple rabbits.
After stuffing them into her mouth, she looked over at Mion and me again with that defiant gaze.
It took only five seconds to take down Rena.
T... That's unfair!
 To think she had such a trick...!!

<Satoko>
"If it upsets you so much, why not reward Rena-san with some praise~?"
Daaaamniiit!!
 That was a dirty trick!!
First of all, that wasn't even praise!!!

<Mion>
"Satoko.
 You think you've won with that, don't you?
 How about I show you guys something much better than your superficial gimmicks!?"

<Keiichi>
"Th-That sounds great, Mion!
 What kind of trick is it!?"

<Mion>
"Kei-chan is going to be the one who does it."

<Keiichi>
"Whaa!?"

<Satoko>
"Ho ho ho! Why don't I have you show me, then?
 The writhing of an old maid!!"
...The plan of attack she suggested was wicked.
But it was the only thing we had to beat Satoko!!
After sipping my tea, I started talking, very naturally and calmly.
 ...Perfectly.

<Keiichi>
"...It really is good, isn't it?
 ...This is all freshly made, right?"

<Rena>
"Ah, no.
 ...Actually, most of it... almost all of it was frozen stuff..."

<Keiichi>
"Then which ones did you make fresh?"

<Rena>
"...Uh...
 Umm...
 Well...
 I-It's embarrassing... Do I really have to say? ...Must I?"
From the synergy of boy plus handmade lunchbox, her expression had melted into euphoria.

<Keiichi>
"...I already know.
 This one... right?"

<Rena>
"Uh?
 ...Uh huh...!?
 ...Uuu...!"
Rena turned an even deeper shade of red, the words "I can't believe it!" practically written on her face.

<Rena>
"H... How can you tell...!?
 ...How? ...Uu... Th-That I made it..."
Of course, Mion had told me beforehand.
...It's been perfect so far!!
After acting like I was shy, I waited a beat.
 ...Next would be...
 the finisher.

<Keiichi>
"It had... your smell."
Silence enveloped the area.
...Rena, face still completely red, froze solid.
With a small yelp, Satoko also blushed.
 Of course I did, too...

<Keiichi>
"...I sure would like... to try one of Rena's handmade apple rabbits...
...
...
 or something..."
Even if this was all because I was competing against Satoko... It felt like I had crossed the line by a good 9 yards, I think...
...Then, at that moment...
Bwoooosh!!
It was a Tupperware container filled with rabbits.

<Rena>
"P-P-P-Please eat some, Keiichi-kun!?!
 Th-Th-Th-There's plenty for you...!!"
Huwarkh!? Instantly, dozens of the apples were shoved into my mouth, knocking me over.

<Rena>
"O-O-Okay.
 S...
 Say ahhh... K-K-K-Keiichi-kun...
 ...Tehehehehe...☆"
My head was forcibly laid upon her lap and even more apples were shoved into my mouth.
 While she was squealing, one apple after another... was forced into my mouth...
 ...
more and more
...
...
 ap
...
...
 ples...
...

<Keiichi>
"H-Howhahouhut hem ahholes, Hahoho... Hooks haik... hee hin... (How 'bout them apples, Satoko? Looks like we win.)"

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, that was a beautiful sacrifice!!
 How's that, Satoko!?
 This is our complete victory, isn't it!?!"

<Satoko>
"I can't believe it... such trickery!!!
 I-It doesn't bother me at all!!!!"
Satoko ground her teeth, mortified!
 We did it!!
I claimed victory as my consciousness drifted slowly away from me.
...At that time, Rena stopped her squealing as she suddenly realized something.

<Rena>
"...Rika-chan, you're not eating it?
 ...Did the... salt water make it too strong, maybe...?
 ...Maybe?"
Looking over, Rika-chan had pulled the toothpick out of the apple rabbit, placed it into her cupped hands, and seemed to be at a loss for what to do.

<Rika>
"...Poor Mr. Rabbit... I feel sorry for him...
 I want...to save him."
Pwee!
...That was the sound of blood spurting from Rena's nose.

<Rena>
"...Kyu...
 Kyky... Kyuute~
 ...
...
Tonight... I will...
 take you home...☆"
She shook sporadically, her head wobbling back and forth.
Then, coming back to her senses, she took all of the apples around me, gathered them up with a fwip fwip fwip, and fixed them back up on a plate.

<Rena>
"Now they're all just fine, 'kay...?
 Here, I'll give them to you, Rika-chan... 'kay?
 ...'kay!"
Rika-chan raised up Satoko's hand like a referee after having that plate of rabbits shoved to her.
 She whispered.

<Rika>
"...This is our victory."

<Mion>
"...Wha... ...WhaaAaaAaaAat!?!?
 A comeback!?!"

<Keiichi>
"...Hai... Hest Honhu hair hehiho... (I... just don't care anymore.)"
...Thus...my sacrifice... ended up being in vain...
It was a fun-filled, crazy day.
But as soon as the sun began to set, the end of the day really did come quickly.

<Mion>
"Later, Rena and Kei-chan! See you tomorrow~!"

<Keiichi>
"Thanks for today, Mion. I had a great time."

<Rena>
"See you tomorrow~!!"
Satoko and Rika-chan went home as well. We parted ways with Mion, and it ended with just Rena and myself enjoying the evening air on our way home.

<Rena>
"...Thanks for coming today, Keiichi-kun.
 ...Was it fun?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.
 Lots of fun.
 Almost feels like a waste to go home now!"

<Rena>
"Ah... Then, well...
 Would you mind taking a little detour... maybe?
 ...Maybe?"

<Keiichi>
"A detour?
 Is it far?"

<Rena>
"It's a bit of a walk... but it won't take long!"
Since we had been walking around all day, I must have seemed a bit tired.
Not feeling like teasing Rena, I quietly nodded.
...Traversing a small path and up a small hill, the land suddenly stretched out before us.
There... What looked like the remains of a dilapidated construction site came into view.
A large heap of garbage spread out off towards the swamp.
Probably illegal dumping. I recalled it being in the newspaper.

<Rena>
"Ufufu!
 It's been quite a while~ I wonder what's here, I wonder what's here...!"

<Keiichi>
"When you say it's been a while... you mean the business you had here... was with this garbage pile!?"

<Rena>
"I-It's not garbage!
 ...To me, it's a pile of treasure..."
Rena had already entered that well-known 'kyute' mode of hers.
So that meant there was something 'kyute' here??

<Rena>
"...Whoa... A new pile.
 ...I can't wait... I can't wait...!"
She descended the unstable slope with ease.
 ...I'd expect no less from a born and bred country girl.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, wait, I'm coming
 ...
 Wohoahoa...!"
My city-raised self was completely pitiful...

<Rena>
"It's all right! Just stay right there, Keiichi-kun! It won't take long!"
Rena kindly declined my accompaniment.

<Keiichi>
"...Don't fall!
 Watch your step!"

<Rena>
"I'm fine, I'm fine.
 This is nothing at all~!"
Literally bounding among the heaps of trash, Rena disappeared from sight.
I didn't like being left behind, but I was still pretty tired from the whole day so I just ended up waiting.
Without the lively Rena around, the surrounding area quickly fell into silence...
...The cry of the higurashi gently cooled the air.
Fairly exhausted, I began to feel a little sleepy.
Just then, the sudden noise of scattering pebbles alerted me to somebody's presence. Startled, I turned around.
Standing there was a typical-looking photographer. He spied over at me through his camera.
His body was tanned and fit.
 But something about him seemed unreliable, and he had a bit of an aloof air about him.
 ...Well, it didn't seem like he was a bad guy in any case.

<Man>
"W-Whoa!
 ...You surprised me!"
Although startled when I turned around, he overplayed his reaction.
That was my line.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm the one who's surprised here."

<Man>
"My bad, my bad.
 I didn't mean to startle you. Are you from Hinamizawa?"
I gathered that he wasn't, from that question.
Unfazed by my suspicious gaze, he introduced himself without my prompting.

<Tomitake>
"I'm Tomitake.
 Freelance photographer.
 I come to Hinamizawa from time to time."
I didn't ask you who you were...

<Keiichi>
"Quite rude to photograph someone without consent, one would think."

<Tomitake>
"My bad, my bad.
 I mainly photograph wild birds.
 They can't refuse, you see.
 Ah hahaha!"
So, what... You're saying I'm the same as the birds?

<Tomitake>
"No, well, you see... that image of a young man in the twilight was just picturesque...
 I apologize for trying to take your picture without asking."
...Adults are pretty slick.
All that annoyance I felt for being startled just flew away as he buttered me up.
I had no intention of hanging around with this guy trying to get cozy with me, except it didn't seem like Rena would be back soon.
But this older guy... Tomitake-san... He didn't mind my cautious responses and continued rambling on by himself.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun~! Sorry to keep you waiting~!
 I'm finished now!!"
Rena popped her head out from one of the lower piles of garbage and waved her hand.

<Tomitake>
"You have someone with you?
 ...What would she be doing over there?"
That's what I wanted to know.

<Keiichi>
"Dunno.
 Maybe she's searching for the corpse from an old murder?"
Tomitake-san looked shaken up by that for a moment.
Uh-oh, I responded like I would if I were talking with Rena and the others.

<Tomitake>
"...It was quite a disturbing incident... They still haven't found it, have they?"


<Rena>
"Hahaha! Keiichi-kun, sorry to keep you~
 You were waiting a while, I guess?
 ...I guess?"

<Tomitake>
"I'd best leave you two lovebirds alone.
 Again, my apologies for startling you, 'Keiichi-kun.'"
Tomitake-san chortled suggestively,  then disappeared into the twilight.
Missing my chance to retort put me off a bit.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun, are you angry?
 ...Why, I wonder?
 ...I wonder?"
It wasn't Rena's fault, so I decided to just brush it off for now.

<Keiichi>
"How was it?
 Find a treasure trove?"

<Rena>
"Oh, yes~ So listen!
 Ah ...um, you see!
 There was...!
 A Colonel Randy doll!♪"

<Keiichi>
"A Colonel Randy doll!?
 ...Oh, that thing. Those statues they always have out in front of that fried chicken place...
 That life-sized dummy?"

<Rena>
"...Yes! Colonel Randy.☆
 ...Hau... kyute... I want to take it hooome...☆"
I couldn't tell how she decides what's 'kyute' or not... but, well, she seems to want it.

<Keiichi>
"It's garbage, right?
 No one would care if you just take it home, right?"

<Rena>
"It's become the base of another pile.
 ...I can't dig it out easily...
 There's no lamp posts over there, so it'll get dark pretty soon..."
Rena seemed quite down about finding a treasure and not being able to bring it back.

<Keiichi>
"I'll help you out.
 To repay you for that delicious picnic you prepared today."

<Rena>
"...Hau... Th... Thank you..."
Birds heading home to roost proclaimed that nightfall would soon be upon us.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun is going to help.☆
 ...I can take Colonel Randy home... hau..."
Rena staggered along as if intoxicated in her dreamy state of mind.
I tried asking her in a way that wouldn't take her out of her cheery state.

<Keiichi>
"...Hey, Rena.
 Long ago, did something happen here?"

<Rena>
"Seems like they were building a dam here.
 I don't know the details, though... hau..."

<Keiichi>
"Just wondering if you knew about, you know...
 an accident or something."

<Rena>
"I don't know."
Her tone was disturbingly frank.
It sounded more like a denial than an answer.
I must have appeared rather dumbstruck.
 Rena quickly lightened her expression.

<Rena>
"Actually, I didn't live here until a year ago."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 You transferred here too?
 I was sure that..."

<Rena>
"So you see, I don't really know much from before that...
 Sorry.☆"
"Don't really know; don't want to talk about it." That was the kind of feeling she gave me.
Thinking about it, of course it would be like that.
 This wasn't the type of thing girls would enjoy talking about.
"...It was quite a disturbing incident... They still haven't found it, have they?"
If it's just like Tomitake-san said...
Then I had a feeling only the higurashi would know.



[Onikakushi Ch.3]


<Mion>
"A Colonel Randy!?
 Ah~ Of course that's right up her alley!"

<Keiichi>
"...I understand her wanting to take home Satoko and Rika-chan.
 But I can't understand the Colonel Randy! What's so good about that four-eyed geezer!?"

<Mion>
"Probably better to hear it from Rena, don't you think?
 She'll probably just say, 'because it's just so kyute☆' though."

<Keiichi>
"Does Rena often... go to the construction site to hunt for treasure?"

<Rika>
"...Every now and then she says she's going to have a look."

<Keiichi>
"But... a girl her age rummaging around in garbage is, well..."

<Rika>
"...If Rena enjoys it, then I think it's fine."

<Keiichi>
"What were they doing over there?
 Dam construction?"
It had been bugging me since yesterday, like an itch I couldn't scratch.

<Mion>
"Hahaha! It was cancelled a long time ago."

<Rika>
"...Everyone gathered together and fought against it."
Hearing an ominous word like "fought" come from Rika-chan's mouth startled me.

<Mion>
"That's right!
 It was unbelievable!
 They said Hinamizawa would be sunk into the reservoir and we had no say in the matter!"
So, I'm only able to be here because the protest succeeded.

<Rena>
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
 I didn't keep you, did I? ...Did I?"

<Satoko>
"My deepest apologies, Keiichi-san. It took me a while to powder my nose!"

<Keiichi>
"Satoko.
 Wait to use the can until you really have to go.
 It's a lot easier since it shoots right out."

<Satoko>
"Eek...
...
 Eek... How dare you speak that way to a maiden of unparalleled beauty such as myself!?!?!"
Who was she calling a maiden?
 If Satoko really was a maiden, she wouldn't have reacted like that.
The usual hijinx ensued.

<Mion>
"Now, then.
 Gentlemen. In accordance with the rules of our society, I bring a point to discussion!
 He, Keiichi Maebara-kun, wishes to be included as a member in our activities... What say you!?"

<Rena>
"Rena has no objection!"

<Satoko>
"Ohohoho!
 I wonder if the likes of this peasant is up to the task."

<Rika>
"...Me and Satoko both approve."
The three that Mion had queried voiced their approval.

<Mion>
"A unanimous decision! Congratulations, Keiichi Maebara-kun.
 I present you the honor of being allowed to take the entrance exam for our club!"

<Keiichi>
"Start from the beginning!
 I didn't say I would join!
 What club is this?"

<Mion>
"What our club does, you see... In order to cope with our complicated society, we perform various activities under different sets of rules.
 ...Sometimes they are in your favor. 

<Mion>
And sometimes they work against you...!!"

<Rena>
"...I'm pretty weak... so I'd prefer if you didn't single me out. Let's try to get along."

<Satoko>
"You're so naive, Rena!
 The Law of the Jungle is survival of the fittest!"
...This was starting to sound a bit sketchy...
 So what kind of club was it!?

<Rika>
"...To sum it up, it's a club where we play games together."
Rika-chan was the only one to answer my question with a pertinent response.
So basically this "club" put Mion's hobby of collecting games to use.
By playing the various games that Mion had hoarded every day.
It seemed that, depending on the day, there were prizes for the winner or a penalty for the person who finished in last place.

<Mion>
"I'll make this clear right now. We aren't playing house here!
 You should treat each win or loss as if your life depends on it, all right!?"

<Keiichi>
"W-What's wrong with just having fun...!?
 Don't make it sound so crazy."

<Mion>
"The first rule of our society!!
 Aim only for first place!
 ...Going at it half-assed just because 'it's a game' is not allowed!"

<Satoko>
"Rule number two of our society!
 For that reason, you are obligated to make all possible efforts!"
...The way Satoko said it, it sounded like she was saying, "use any means necessary."

<Rika>
"...Of course, I will do my best, too."

<Rena>
"I'm pretty weak... but I'm trying my best."
I knew what they were trying to say.
In a game where everybody is aiming for the top, it's rather unsportsmanlike to play just for fun.

<Keiichi>
"All right. Then I, too... will go all-out!!"
With that, I was finally ready for the rite of initiation... My baptism into the club.

<Mion>
"A word of warning, Kei-chan.
 ...Rena can get pretty nasty."
This initiation looks like it's going to be rough...
Mion began fishing around in the student lockers in the back of the room.
...They have the games here at the school?
 ...Well, it's club equipment, so I guess that's fine.

<Mion>
"Complicated games would put Kei-chan at a disadvantage.
 So today, we'll play a game that you should be familiar with.
 How about a standard card game...?
 ...
Like Old Bachelor!?"


<Keiichi>
"All right! Let's do this!!"

<Mion>
"Can't really get into it unless there's a penalty!
 This time the loser will be sentenced to having their face drawn on!
 What do you think!?"

<Rena>
"Whoa,
 whoa
 ...It won't be a permanent marker, right?
 ...Right...?"
...Permanent... She wants to draw on our faces with permanent marker?

<Satoko>
"That is perfect—!!!!"
Satoko cheered the idea on.
She didn't even flinch at the thought of such a severe penalty.
 It seemed like she was raring to go.
...If it's going to be like this, then I can't lose either!

<Mion>
"Then I'll just cut the deck... and start dealing!"
Old Bachelor is pretty much the same as Old Maid.
There's only one difference: there's no joker.
 In its place, one card is pulled out at the start.
Meaning there will be one card without a match left over at the end.
You don't know which card will end up being the joker.
 It's a pretty thrilling game!

<Mion>
"I'll take out the card now."
Mion took out one card and left it face down on the table.
Everybody stared at the card intently.

<Keiichi>
"Well, it'll be pretty obvious in the endgame.
 No way to tell at the start."
But... the rest of them were very serious.
 They didn't seem as relaxed as I was.
They compared their cards to the one face down, all the while gauging each other's reactions.
It was as if...they could see what the face down card was...
...No, it couldn't be.

<Keiichi>
"...This deck is pretty worn out.
 ...No way... Can everyone tell by the scratches what the card on the table is...?"

<Satoko>
"Remember the second rule of our society~
 Keiichi-san must try his hardest to win as well~!"

<Rena>
"A number of cards are quite unique... Keiichi-kun should be able to remember them pretty quickly."
She said that so matter-of-factly.

<Keiichi>
"S-Suits me fine!!
 Don't think a little thing like that can be your crutch!!!"
...I lashed out angrily, but it was rather obvious I was at a disadvantage.
After all... they'd gone so far as to memorize the wear and tear for each individual card...!
This wasn't a simple game of Old Bachelor.
 ...If this was a test...
 then they were playing with the answer sheet in front of them!!

Bring it!
 I'll take advantage of your carelessness and beat you at your own game...!
...That baseless confidence... would soon be crushed...

<Mion>
"Kekeke!
 How about I tell you your hand starting from the right?
 Three,
 Four,
 Nine,
 Jack,
 Queen."

<Keiichi>
"WaAargh!!"

<Rika>
"...By the way, the bachelor is the Jack of Diamonds."

<Keiichi>
"GaAaRgh!!"

<Satoko>
"I can tell what they are even if you switch them around!
 I am out!!"

<Keiichi>
"UuUrrgh!!"
I thought I was prepared... but for it to be this brutal... Just overwhelming...!!!

<Keiichi>
"D... Demons...
 You're all demons...!
 Rena... isn't... a demon, are you...?"

<Rena>
"S-Sorry, Keiichi-kun.
 ...This is the Three of Hearts, isn't it?
 ...I'm out!"


<Keiichi>
"UwaAaaAaaAaaaAAah!!"
Not even a hint of mercy...!!
 Rena... Even Rika-chan...!!
These club activities weren't to be trifled with.
 An alumnus of this club would definitely survive in the cruelest of situations...
If our entire class had self-detonating collars strapped to their necks and were dropped into a death match on a deserted island, these guys would probably take to it like fish to water.
I can already picture their joy as they hunt down each of their classmates...

<Mion>
"It's a lowest point system.
 The order itself dictates the points. Whoever has the lowest point total wins!"

<Rika>
"...Since Keiichi finished last, he has five points."
There's already a 5 marked down on my scoreboard...!

<Rena>
"...I-I think it's unfair to Keiichi-kun if we don't use a new deck."

<Mion>
"It's fine, it's fine. Kei-chan is a man after all.

<Mion>
He can turn the tables even if the odds are stacked against him, right!?"

<Satoko>
"It's fitting for a lowly peasant to scamper home and soak their pillow in tears, don't you think~??"
A petite hand laid itself on top of my head, which was trembling from uncontainable frustration.
 ...It was Rika-chan's.

<Rika>
"...Keep on fighting,
 yeah~."
Thanks to Rika-chan's words of encouragement, I was able to calm down.
You need to be calm, especially when you're cornered.
 ...That's the "power" I could muster during this crisis.
Think clearly, Keiichi Maebara.
...Take your time and look at the cards carefully.
It's just as Rena said, several of the cards have their own distinct markings making them stand out. Memorizing them should be pretty simple.
Think about what you can do in this situation. Try everything in your power to improve your chances of victory.

<Rena>
"Whoa... Great, Keiichi-kun. Just like that!"
I covered the uniquely-marked cards with my hands or other cards, arranging them in such a way that they couldn't be seen.

<Rika>
"...The one with the ripped corner should be the Five...
 And... I'm out."
I couldn't let any of those precious hints slip by me.
 All information is a weapon.
Then it was my turn.
Satoko fanned out her cards for me.

<Keiichi>
"You see, I want the Seven.
 ...Is it this one?"

<Satoko>
"...I wonder about that...
 You won't know unless you take it..."
There was a bit of dismay in her expression.
 ...Like she doesn't want it taken... That kind of expression...!
I won't let that momentary lapse slip by me!!

<Keiichi>
"I know!!
 It's this ooooone!!!!"
Got it!
 Seven of Spades...!!!

A cheer of "Ooo!" rang out!

<Satoko>
"W-Wh-Wh-What is this!?
 The Seven should be the hardest one of all to tell apart~!?!?!"
It wasn't from memorizing the markings. Those slight changes in their expressions as I was selecting a card were enough!

<Mion>
"Can't hide it from me, Kei-chan!
 ...This mark means it's the Two of Diamonds.
 ...What!?"
She was startled by her own misread.
 Of course everyone else was too...!

<Rena>
"...Whoa
 ...It's rare that Mii-chan gets a card wrong."

<Mion>
"N-No...
 Kei-chan
 ...
 Could it be... you...!!"
They told them apart by different "marks."
 That mark was a "nail scratch."
So... I put...
 a new one on it!!


<Satoko>
"Are you saying he disguised it... as the Two of Diamonds!?
 W...What an impressive show of wit...!!"

<Rika>
"...Keiichi landed a clean hit."
Clap clap clap...

<Rena>
"That's great, Keiichi-kun!
 That was an incredible match, you know!? You know!?"
Having defeated the forerunner, Mion, my brilliant battle left me ecstatic.
But by total points, it was already set in stone that Mion would win and I would finish last.
I laughed haughtily, selecting the tone of my voice carefully to get on Mion's nerves.

<Keiichi>
"...Well... I'm going to end up the loser, but I'm satisfied with one-upping Mion at the end.☆
 Bwahahahahahaa~...♪"
That should be the proverbial slap in the face to Mion, who was at the top already and ensured victory...!

<Mion>
"Even if Kei-chan gets first place this round, he'll still end up last place overall
 ...
Don't you hate that?"

<Keiichi>
"Of course I do!"

<Mion>
"Let's have a duel.
 One chance!
 If you win, then we'll swap first and last place! ...How about it!? You up for it!?"
She fell for it!
A chance for an upset that wouldn't be possible without goading her into it!!

<Keiichi>
"One chance, you say?
 Let me hear the rules."
Mion discarded two cards from her hand and replaced one with the joker card that was on the table, then shuffled the resulting hand behind her back.

<Mion>
"The card in my right or the card in my left!
 If Kei-chan can guess which hand the joker's in, then he wins!"

<Keiichi>
"When you turned around just now, you didn't pull out the joker, did you!?"

<Mion>
"If you lose, I'll show the card in the other hand.
 That okay?"
The other three gulped nervously at this unexpected turn of events.

<Keiichi>
"...All right!!
 You've got it!!!!"

Mion grasped one card in each hand and thrust them out at me!
First, I needed to inspect them closely...!
The card on the right had no distinguishing marks, I couldn't tell which one it was.

<Rena>
"...Which one, I wonder... Keiichi-kun... Be careful!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, of course! ...This is my chance... for a big comeback!!"
Looking closely at the card on the left, I saw a little wear. It wasn't one I hadn't seen before.

<Satoko>
"Ah... That card is...!!"
I didn't let that bit from Satoko slip by me.
Mion clucked her tongue.
I didn't recognize the mark on the left card from the small number that I had memorized.
I didn't know what the left card was, but I could tell from Satoko's reaction that the card had already appeared during the game.
Since it had already appeared before, it meant that it definitely wasn't the joker!

<Mion>
"...Ooh.
 Kei-chan thinks it's the one on the right?
 Will you choose that one then?
 Will you?"
...The left card definitely wasn't the joker. If I could trust that theory, then I should've been able to declare that the card to the right was the joker.
Even without Mion's taunting... The one on the right was the most suspicious.
But wasn't it a bit too rash to decide based solely on Satoko's reaction!?
 More... carefully...
 ...
 Ah!
...I remember now...!!
 That mark... The left card...
 No doubt about it!
 The Seven of Clubs!!!

<Rena>
"Hmm...
 It's the Seven of Clubs, I see..."
I've won!
 The card on the left was the Seven of Clubs!
So that meant the card on the right was... the joker!!!!
And then, just before my hand touched the right card, I froze.

<Keiichi>
"...Huhuhuh...
 heheheh...
 I would expect no less from you."
There was a wave of murmurs amongst the onlookers at my sudden halt, right before I confirmed the right card was the joker.

<Satoko>
"??
 Huh?
 What could Keiichi-san possibly be saying??
 I mean, the left one is..."

<Rika>
"...Shh."

<Mion>
"Ooh...
 What makes you so certain that the right one isn't the joker, Kei-chan?"
Mion let loose an unexpected question.
 Everyone else was baffled.

<Keiichi>
"I don't know what the card on the right could be.
 But I know that the one on the left is the Seven of Clubs."

<Satoko>
"Then!
 Doesn't that leave the right one as the joker!?
 One of them has to be the joker, right!?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.
 ...One of those is the joker, right?"

<Rika>
"...Keiichi has good intuition."

<Rena>
"Huh?
 Rika-chan, what do you mean by...?"

<Keiichi>
"So basically...
 the Seven of Clubs...
 I discarded that by matching it with Satoko's Seven of Spades earlier...!"
Everyone's attention snapped to the discard pile at the same time!
The truth of the matter couldn't be discerned from that sloppy pile...!

<Keiichi>
"So that means...
 Mion pocketed one of discarded cards... then aligned it over the left card... and that means—!!!"

<Rena>
"...I see, I get it!
 This left card... is being disguised as the Seven of Clubs, right!?"
It was the first time since the start of the match that a shadow ran across Mion's expression, and I didn't let that slip by.
Then... with a grand flourish, I declared it loudly!!

<Keiichi>
"The joker is...
 ...
 the left ooooooooooone!!!!!!"

It was an intense moment...!
 That one second felt like an eternity for everyone there.
Breaking that silence, the first one to speak... was Mion.

<Mion>
"...Being the first president of this club, I've been witness to a variety of performances.
 Kei-chan...
 yours is...
 the best.
 ...The best of the best of the best!"
That was probably the greatest compliment Mion could give.
 Mion accepted her defeat... dropping the cards from both hands.
...My...
 comeback victory!!!!!!!
Rika-chan placed her hand on my head and began petting it, congratulating me on my victory.

<Rena>
"Huh...?
 ...Rika-chan is...?"
Rena and Satoko gaped at us... as if they had seen a ghost.

<Keiichi>
"What is it, Rena? It's not as if I cheated or anything, right?? This was fair and square!"

<Satoko>
"...Rika... only pets someone on the head...to console them."
Huh...? What's the meaning of...?
At that moment, Rena let out a small shriek.

<Rena>
"Ke... Keiichi-kun...!
 ...This is how it was...!?!?"

<Mion>
"You know, Kei-chan.
 I thought you'd read into it that far.
 ...Heheheh!"
Everyone froze.
 ...No, it was just me...

<Mion>
"It was a gamble.
 If you had just jumped to conclusions like a little brat, then I would have lost."
...It was the answer everyone was certain about...
Mion picked up the card from the losing hand...

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, you know, you should take pride in this loss."
She turned it around...
...That was... the card that proclaimed the victor of this duel.
The card under the Seven of Clubs
 ...
 Unbelievable! It was the Two of Diamonds!
I-It was a setup behind the setup...!!
 If I'd just picked the right one without reading so deeply into it...!

<Mion>
"...I, Mion Sonozaki, as the club president...
 do accept...
 Keiichi Maebara's membership...into our club...!!!"
As I slumped to my knees, dazed, everybody let out a round of applause for the excellent effort I gave despite my defeat.

<Mion>
"The match is now over!!
 Today's victor is me! Mion Sonozaki! And our exalted loser is...
 Keiichi Maebara~!!!"
Everyone made a commotion, applauding cheerfully.
I felt I was bested, but I was so soundly beaten that it unexpectedly felt rather refreshing...

<Rena>
"When Mii-chan pulled that little trick behind her back I got excited, thinking, 'She's going to do it again!'"

<Satoko>
"When Keiichi-san stopped the moment before touching the correct card, I thought, 'He fell for it~!'"

<Rika>
"...He fell for it quite handily."
...Huh?
Hey, wait.
All of them knew from the start and still got so excited so earnestly...??

<Rika>
"...Everyone got excited to make it more fun."
...
 You...

<Keiichi>
"You're all demoooons! You monsters~!!!"

<Mion>
"Now, then, Kei-chan... it's time for your penalty...!
 Since it's your first day participating,
 I'll go easy, okay?
 ...It would be a problem if you refused to come to school!"
The other three members held down my arms and shoulders firmly.
Mion approached, licking her lips...
Her right hand went to pull something out of her pocket.
That's... a felt-tip marker!! And it's... a giant permanent one!!!

<Mion>
"Okay...Here we gooo~!"
She took the cap off the marker and brought it slowly up to my face while I was immobilized...!

<Keiichi>
"N-No...
 NOoOoOoOoo...oo...oo...!!!"
I let out my death throes...
As soon as the club activities were finished, Rena flew off.
Probably so she could dig out that 'kyute' Colonel Randy that she wasn't able to take home yesterday.
So today it was just Mion and me walking home together, a rather rare occurrence.

<Mion>
"A mountain of treasure, huh...
 The guys throwing it away probably never thought in their wildest dreams that Rena would be grateful to them."
"Mountain of treasure," meaning that dam construction site from before.
...Oh, right. Mion would probably tell me.
That murder by dismemberment that seemed to have happened there...

<Keiichi>
"Over there, you know, at that dam construction site.
 ...Did something happen there?
 Long ago?"

<Mion>
"Something sure did. A grand battle!
 There were sit-ins and demonstrations!"
It was a bit different from what I wanted to hear, but I decided I'd listen just the same.

<Keiichi>
"It was our land that was going to be sunk into the dam reservoir.
 I would have fought as well, probably."

<Mion>
"The government guys were really adamant about it.
 Acting all big and full of themselves!
 Since they figured out that they couldn't settle it with money, they did a bunch of nasty stuff!
 They were nasty guys!"
Mion spoke excitedly, as if the whole thing was happening right in front of her.

<Keiichi>
"I'm amazed you guys won... You were facing the federal government, right?"

<Mion>
"The mayor and prominent figures in the village all signed petitions.
 They went to Tokyo and struck deals with legislators...
 And as a result, the development plan was retracted.
 It was our complete victory! 

<Mion>
Ahahahahaha!"

<Keiichi>
"There wasn't any... violence, was there?
 Like assaults... or murders?"

<Mion>
"None."
She promptly cut me off.
The same as Rena had.
Her words signaled the end of discussion.
Tomitake-san said that "they still haven't found" something in an 'incident.'
I thought... that some murder had occurred and there was something waiting to be found... but I guess I was wrong.
My curiosity unsated, I sighed dejectedly inside.

<Mion>
"Later. See you tomorrow!
 Kei-chan! You can't wash that off until you get home, got it!?"

<Keiichi>
"I got it. I won't!"
Mion held back her laughter while stealing glances at my face.
...I wonder what kind of nasty doodles they drew...
Damn you, Mion! You shall rue this day...!
If our roles are ever reversed... I'm going to go all out!
 All over your face so you won't be able to take it off, even with a scouring pad...!!!
Upon arriving home, I ran straight into my mom, embarrassing myself yet again...
The mood I'd come home to was already on edge.
...It's not an uncommon thing in our family.
Whenever Dad can't come up with a good idea, it always ends up like this.
He stomps around the house with his arms crossed.
Mom whispered into my ear.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Welcome home, Keiichi. ...Dad... he's in a bit of a rut right now, so don't bother him, okay?"

<Keiichi>
"He can't come up with a new idea?"

<Keiichi's mom>
"It's because the deadlines are so close together this time.
 Your dad needs time to recharge or he doesn't work as well."
Dad's paintings feed our entire family. If he runs out of ideas, then it's the end of the Maebaras.
(...We've never gone hungry before.
 ...Could it be that my dad... is a master painter??)

<Keiichi>
"...Wouldn't it be easier to get an idea taking a walk outside rather than wandering around the house?"

<Keiichi's mom>
"The theme of the piece this time is 'in the household.'
 So it seems your dad wants to use this house as a motif."
...That's quite a bothersome motif.

<Keiichi's dad>
"...Keiichi!! Tidy your room for once in a while!! It looks terrible!"

<Keiichi>
"S-Sorry! I'll clean it up later!"
Ah, come on! Please don't use my room as the motif...!

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi, there's still some time before dinner.
 So please go take a walk out back or something."
Dad's moods are only temporary.
As soon as he gets an idea, his mood improves and he starts humming.
Until then, it wouldn't be a bad idea to just go take a walk so I don't aggravate him further.

<Keiichi>
"Well, I guess I will then."
I said I was going to take a walk, but I didn't have any particular destination in mind.
I just needed to kill some time.
I got on my bike and pondered where to go.
I could just go read at the bookstore, but it would take about an hour by bike to get to town.
It would be dark by the time I got back, so I didn't want to go unless I had to.
The roads at night here in Hinamizawa creep me out.
If Mion or Satoko ever found out about that...
 I smiled wryly.
Oh yeah.
Rena was probably still at the mountain of treasure... The dam construction site.
The excavation of Colonel Randy was probably taking her a while.
It wouldn't be so bad to have her owe me one.

<Keiichi>
"...She might return the favor next time we have club activities."
With a little bit of self-interest in mind, I set off towards the dam construction site.
Tomitake-san might be there as well.
The only person with information about the incident that both Rena and Mion denied knowing anything about.
If I met him again, I'd like to ask for more details...
...To ask, "Was there really a murder here in Hinamizawa?"
That was my real intention.
I spotted Rena struggling up on the slope of the garbage pile.
It looked like Colonel Randy was lodged in there pretty firmly.
It didn't look like Rena would be able to excavate him by herself.
Realizing that Tomitake-san wasn't around, I began climbing down the slope unsteadily.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Rena.
 Looks like you're working up a sweat."

<Rena>
"...Whoa,
 whoa,
 Keiichi-kun!
 ...What brings you to a place like this?"
A place like this, huh?
 I see. She was aware of it, at least.

<Keiichi>
"I received a signal for emergency assistance at the accident site!
 Where is the injured party!?"

<Rena>
"Huh!? Huh!?
 Accident!?
 ...Huh!?"

<Keiichi>
"But there was a report Colonel Randy was buried alive in the trash pile...!"

<Rena>
"Huh? ...O-Oh, that. You scared me...
 Don't frighten me like that, Keiichi-kun."

<Keiichi>
"...I was just kidding.
 I thought you might be struggling by yourself, so I came to help you out."

<Rena>
"...Eh? ...You came... for me...?
 ...Hau."
Well, I filled my quota for today.
If I don't see Rena blush at least once a day, then I'm not getting my daily required nutritional intake.

<Keiichi>
"Just kidding. You're embarrassing me now!"

<Rena>
"...So... huh?
 ...What part... was the joke? What part was it!?"
I just ignored her bewilderment.

<Keiichi>
"Okay, now move out of the way.
 So where is Colonel Randy?"

<Rena>
"...Ah, sorry!
 ...Can't you see him... in that gap?"

<Keiichi>
"He's... really buried in there...!!"
The Colonel Randy was sideways, surrounded by boards and other construction materials, like they were caging him inside.
According to Rena, it wasn't like this yesterday.
It seems as though another illegal dumper came yesterday, dumped again, and now he's buried like this.

<Keiichi>
"...You're trying to move this pile all by yourself...!?
 With those scrawny arms...!?"
There's no way she would be able to do that with her slender arms.

<Rena>
"...But... Colonel Randy... so kyute...
 There's a chain on the Colonel Randy at the store... This one, though... I should be able to take this one home...
 Hau..."
If Rena gave up on this Colonel Randy, she'll probably start devising a plan to steal the one in front of the store...
As Rena's guardian, I won't allow her to sully her hands with crime!

<Keiichi>
"Out of the way. I'll do it."
Rena blushed again, but this time I left it alone.
The pile was enormous.
Also, the more days we wasted, the more likely another illegal dumping would occur.
If it got buried any deeper, there would be nothing that could be done.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, I'll help too. Let me help."

<Keiichi>
"You'd just get in the way, so stay back!
 Hrrrrnnnnnngh!!"
Pulling out scraps,
 bending them,
 tossing them aside.
I quickly became covered in sweat and dust.
Flying objects drew beautiful arcs across the twilight sky, one after another.
Lumber,
 timber,
 plywood.
Damn iiiit!!
 No matter how much I threw out, there was still more!!
Even though I could see Colonel Randy right there!!
After grandstanding like that in front of Rena, I felt frantic because of how little I had progressed.

<Keiichi>
"...If I was going to do this seriously... I'd need an axe or saw or something...!"

<Rena>
"That's enough, Keiichi-kun...!
 You're so sweaty.
 ...You don't... have to try... so hard..."

<Keiichi>
"I'm just doing it for you, Rena.
 Don't worry about it."
Rena began sputtering and turned beet red.
Ah, whoops... I meant to say I was trying my best so as to keep her from becoming a criminal...
Oh well.

<Keiichi>
"I guess I just... need a break...!
 This... is pretty tough...!!"
I sprawled on my back over the grassy slope.

<Rena>
"I'm so sorry...
 You're... covered in sweat..."
Rena patted her handkerchief against my forehead.
It felt pretty nice.

<Rena>
"U-Uhm, well, wait here a minute, okay?
 My house is pretty close.
 I'll bring you some barley tea, okay?"
Leaving the handkerchief on my forehead, Rena took off running.
The cries of the higurashi gently cooled the air.
After I was certain that Rena was gone, I picked myself up and headed towards what I'd discovered earlier.
That was a garbage pile of magazines and newspapers bound up in twine.
Unless I'm mistaken...
 I believe it... was around here...
There it was.
They were bound stacks of not-so-reputable tabloids.
They were stacked chronologically, going back quite a few years.
"...It was quite a disturbing incident.
 ...They still haven't found it, have they?"
If it was just as Tomitake-san said, that undoubtedly pointed to the fact that there had been a murder.
...And that there was still "something" to be found.
These are troubled times.
 There is no end to these sickening incidents.
There's a large part of society drawn in by these incidents, as well.
So it had to be recorded.
 Somewhere.
I unfastened the packages and opened the rain-soaked pages carefully, looking over the table of contents.
Not here.
 Next one.
 Not here.
 Next one.
It was hard to search since I didn't know when it happened.
I didn't know who the perpetrator or the victim was, either.
I only knew it had happened here.
I looked up every so often, checking to see if Rena had come back or not.
I wouldn't want her to see me gawking at a dirty magazine, but it wasn't just that.
Both Rena and Mion said they didn't know.
But it had happened, without a doubt.
...As long as Tomitake-san wasn't lying.
Then if both Rena and Mion...
 "Ah. Yeah, there was."
 If they had just said that, then I wouldn't have gotten so hung up on it.
An 'incident' that neither Rena nor Mion wished to talk about.
Trying to uncover it after they tried to conceal it out of good intentions...
That made me feel like I was acting against my friends.
"HINAMIZAWA DAM WORKER LYNCHING! MURDER BY DISMEMBERMENT!!"

...Here it is!
The featured article was in the back and it seemed that there was a photograph in the colored pages at the front.
The pages of the featured article were stuck together and weren't easy to open.
Rena could return at any moment.
...Feeling rushed, I gave up and opened the photograph page.
The police investigators were carrying a body bag and newspaper reporters were all bathing it in camera flashes.
The image was blurry and hard to understand, but I could definitely make out the headlines.
"A Tragic Nightmare at the Hinamizawa Construction Site! Lynching and Murder/Dismemberment!"
"The victim was the site foreman. He had assaulted his assailants daily with..."
"An explosive backlash from his daily actions? It's a horrible image, to see the site foreman as..."
...It happened...
 It really did happen...
It seemed the details were on the next page.
...I turned the page without pausing.
...On it was...
"The assailants butchered the victim's body with hatchets and pickaxes,
then used an axe to split the cadaver into six pieces: the head, arms, legs, and torso."

I could understand just from the headline that it was... just too terrible...
 an incident.
Normally a lynching is just assault and murder right...?
Dismemberment with hatchets and pickaxes?
 That wasn't a lynching.
It was a merciless killing to the letter, a brutal murder...
Done by a group of people.
...With hatchets.
 ...With pickaxes.
 ...With... a hatchet.

<Keiichi>
"AhhHhhhHhHhhh!!!"

<Rena>
"Eek! S-S-Sorry...!!!
 Did I startle you!? Did I startle you!?"
Rena dropped the hatchet she was holding onto the grass after being startled by my voice.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, you see, earlier, yeah, you said it would help if you had an axe or something, didn't you!?
 S-So then I... brought a hatchet for you... from the shed...!!"
Rena fluttered her arms in a panic, continuing to explain and apologize.
It seemed I'd been glaring at her pretty intensely.

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm sorry... I guess my reaction was a bit overboard."

<Rena>
"N-No... I-I'm sorry as well! ...I'm sorry!"
...Night was drawing close.
I was pretty worn out, and it wouldn't hurt to do the rest tomorrow.

<Keiichi>
"Doesn't look like we can break that last beam without that hatchet.
 You brought it after all... I'll have to borrow it tomorrow.
 All right?"

<Rena>
"...Okay."

<Keiichi>
"Why do you look so glum? Tomorrow we'll be digging out Colonel Randy, right!?"

<Rena>
"You're right. ...Ahahaha!
 I really want to take Colonel Randy home soon~!"
We both knew that it was useless to apologize any more than that.
I quenched my thirst with the barley tea Rena brought and wiped off the sweat that had now gone cold. We took the path to head home.
I felt quite guilty about the tabloid wrapped up in my jacket.



[Onikakushi Ch.4]

The function of this school as an educational facility is very questionable.
Our PE class is exceptionally disorganized.
The only things we do together are the warm-ups at the start.
The teacher isn't even there after that.
 All we do is play together.

<Mion>
"No helping it. Everybody's a different age or gender."

<Rena>
"The only rule was that we have to stay on school grounds while exercising."
All the little kids were gallivanting about.
Well... they certainly are being active. They might be getting plenty of exercise, but...

<Keiichi>
"...The board of education probably completely forgot about this school."

<Rika>
"...Sorry to keep you waiting."

<Satoko>
"We're all together now. What shall we do today for PE!?"

<Keiichi>
"All right.
 We have all of our members gathered now."

<Rena>
"Now then, Class Representative, what shall we do for PE today?
 What shall we do?"
...Mion harrumphed and crossed her arms haughtily, surveying the area.

<Mion>
"Explosive power and endurance.
 There are no friends in the world of sports.
 Everyone is a rival! The only thing you can trust in is your own body!"

<Keiichi>
"What the heck do you mean by that? You really read too much manga."
I quipped without missing a beat.

<Mion>
"And so, we'll be taking a lesson from history!!
 The tried and true king of all outdoor melee events...
 Let's play tag!"

It was quite the adorable choice to make after playing it up so much.

<Satoko>
"Just what I was hoping for~!!
 That dunderhead Keiichi-san shall be the first one to be it!"

<Rika>
"...I won't be beaten."

<Rena>
"I'll try my best too! You can't beat me~!"

<Keiichi>
"...Why are you guys all so into it...?"

<Mion>
"The third rule of our society!! You must partake in the game, enjoying it without question!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Then... this counts as a club activity!?"
Everyone smirked at each other.
They all seemed pretty confident.
 I'm a man.
Physically, I should be able to keep up with any girls my own age.
Regardless, Mion and Satoko looked like they were aiming for victory and Rena was looking at me as if pitying my disadvantage.

<Keiichi>
"...Fine. Tag,
 I'm iiiiiiiiin!!!"
My yell echoed across the school grounds.
These were the rules:
Anyone who was able to evade being tagged before the bell was a winner.
But we didn't switch who was 'it.'
 The ones who were tagged by 'it' also became 'it.'
So the number of people who were 'it' could increase exponentially.
The endgame would become a hellish siege.

<Mion>
"We call this version 'zombie tag,' you see."

<Keiichi>
"I see. Anyone infected by a zombie turns into a zombie."

<Rena>
"...Why do you make it sound so scary, I wonder?
 ...I wonder?"

<Keiichi>
"As soon as I catch Rena, I'm going to tear out her entrails while she's still alive...!!"

<Rena>
"...G-G-Gr-Gross, Keiichi-kun, that's gross...!"
Rika-chan placed her hand on Rena's head as she panicked.

<Rika>
"...Don't worry. ...Before Keiichi gobbles you down, I'll eat you up gently."

<Satoko>
"Rika, that isn't comforting at all."
Both Mion and I nodded deeply.

<Keiichi>
"So, the first 'it'... how do you decide who's the zombie?
 ...With rock-paper-scissors?"

<Mion>
"Well, it is class time after all. Let's decide by answering questions.
 I'll ask the questions, and the one who isn't able to answer is the zombie!"
I have no idea which grade level they're coming from.

<Mion>
"What does the Japanese word 「roku」 mean?"
Huh?
 ...I was bewildered by the sudden question.
Mion repeated it.

<Mion>
"So you need to answer!
 What's 「roku」 in English!?"

<Keiichi>
"Uhm, it's six!!"

<Mion>
"How about 「kutsushita」!?"

<Rena>
"Socks!"

<Mion>
"What's the third-last letter in the alphabet!?"

<Rika>
"...It's X."

<Mion>
"What does 「seibetsu」 mean!?"

<Satoko>
"Of course I know what that is~!!
 It's...!!
...
..."
Satoko cut herself off before finishing the answer.
...I see. It's quite a lewd question.

<Mion>
"You're an adult, aren't you~?
 Of course you know what it is, right??"

<Satoko>
"...I-I certainly do...!
 Of course I know...!!"

<Mion>
"Then go ahead and say it.
 'That,' you know? 'That.'
 What does 'that' mean, exactly?"

<Rena>
"...Hau... Satoko looks like she's in trouble...
 How kyute..."

<Keiichi>
"Don't take her home. It's a crime."
If I didn't nip it in the bud, she really might have tried to take her home...
Mion's pursuit was relentless, making Satoko stammer.

<Mion>
"Now then, go ahead and say it, nice and loudly!!

<Mion>
What does 'that' mean!?!?"

<Satoko>
"I do know...!!
 I do know!!
 I do know!!!...
 ...
I- it's..."

<Rika>
"'That' means a previously indicated person, thing or event."

<Satoko>
"Huh?
 ...Ah."
All of us were a bit surprised by Rika-chan's unexpected answer.
I see. Well it certainly is what 'that' means.
 ...That could have been awkward.
...I wonder what I would have done in Satoko's position.
...I'd probably get ticked off and just blurt out you-know-what at the top of my lungs...
I wouldn't want you as an enemy, Mion Sonozaki!
Thank goodness you were born a girl.
If you were a boy, you'd probably be a perverted asshole...

<Satoko>
"It... It appears I have no choice.
 ...Unfortunately, I, Satoko Houjou, shall assume the role of the zombie.
 ...
 I shall eat everyone~!!"
Seems like she's raring to go.

<Satoko>
"All I must do is count to 100, correct!?"

<Keiichi>
"Some jerks skip numbers while counting to 100.
 So you can start chasing after you solve this problem."

<Rena>
"Whoa, Keiichi-kun... give her a simple one, okay...?"

<Keiichi>
"1/5th of a cake, 1/6th of a cake, and 1/7th of a cake are all on a plate."

<Satoko>
"Oh no!!
 Th-There are no common denominators?!?!"
Satoko grabbed a stick in a panic and began drawing a cake and fractions on the ground.

<Keiichi>
"If Satoko, who can eat one cake in 60 seconds, eats all of them... how many cakes are left on the plate?"
Just as I finished giving the word problem, Mion shouted.

<Mion>
"Ready... go!!!!"
On Mion's signal, everyone but Satoko scattered.

<Rena>
"Heheh... Keiichi-kun,
 that wasn't a problem at all, was it?"
Satoko had already lost the moment she started working it out.
She's eating it all, so of course there's nothing left on the plate!
Everyone dashed off in a direction they thought was best.
Knowing the lay of the land, they probably headed right to the best spots.
It was obvious I was at a disadvantage.
At a time like this, it would have been more effective to go along with those trained in survival skills...
 Like Mion, for example.
...The fact that I didn't realize it at the start of the game probably hurt my chances.
Glancing back over the school grounds, I saw Satoko just rising up to start.
She was really, really mad.
 Mwahaha!
 ...She got tripped up on such a dumb question.
I stood at one of the corners of the school.
I had clear sightlines in two directions and would probably have a good response time if any zombies started closing in.
For the time being, I caught my breath and focused on what I was trained to think during club activities yesterday.
...Now think calmly, Keiichi Maebara...
 If I was 'it,' what would I do?
Increasing my numbers would be the shortcut to victory.
...Then going after the weakest player first is the obvious plan of attack.
Meaning... me!

<Satoko>
"Now then, where could Keiichi-san possibly be!?
 I shan't let you escape!!!"
...But of course.
What would be the best method to track me down?
Footprints or smell... or maybe some type of trail.
If I could craftily hide my tracks... then there would be no trail for Satoko to follow!
But I was no detective... Would I even be able to do that kind of thing in an amateur game like this?

<Satoko>
"Tomita~ Okamura~!
 Have you seen Keiichi-san recently!?"
Wh-What the heeeeeck!?!?
Do zombies hunt their prey by asking nicely where they went!?!?
Tomita-kun and Okamura-kun pointed to the location where I was hiding.
After confirming she was headed in this direction, I abandoned my position.
It wasn't easy to hide myself with all those little kids running around as they pleased.
It was becoming even more obvious that I was at a disadvantage from not being familiar with these surroundings...!
If that's how it was going to be... Then to confront this intelligence-gathering zombie, I'd just counter it in a similar vein...!!
I approached some girls playing with a ball.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm sorry, but could you relay this message?
 Tell Satoko Houjou that her parents are at the gate,
 please."

<Girl>
"Message, message, ahahaha~~!!
 Okay okay!"
I stopped the girls as they turned to run off.

<Keiichi>
"Wait, don't go yet!
 Also, take this one to Mion Sonozaki.
 Tell her the teacher is calling her to the gate."
Mwahaha, I am quite the schemer, if I do say so myself...!
If things went well, then Satoko and Mion would run into each other at the gate!!
It would put me at a disadvantage if more people were 'it,' but this was Mion we were talking about.
 She'd figure out a way to escape.
...But that was just fine.
 As long as it bought me more time...!!
Mwahaha, dance for me, Mion and Satoko!!
 In the palm of my haaaaaand!!!
Having my fill of playing the conman, I looked for a place to hide.
If you think about it logically, I'd only bought myself a scant amount of time.
 ...And it might even come back to bite me...!
Once it became apparent I'd started spreading false information through messengers, I could end up being the recipient of one of those 'messages.'
Satoko would probably ask the messengers to help her look for me.
That would mean... there would be more zombies than participants in the game!!
The virus that was brought about by my mischief could cause an epidemic...
All my classmates would transform into zombies... and would only be searching for me!
...This tactic...
 This tactic might backfire horribly.
While trembling at the thought of the impending Dawn of the Dead, I began searching for a safehouse.
I found a shed by the incinerator behind the school.
After climbing up to the roof, I held my breath.
It wasn't a bad place to hold out.
Not only did I have good line of sight but, if necessary, I could jump off in three different directions to escape!
It was getting rowdy down there.
 The lower grades were running around below the shed.

<Girl>
"Maebara-san isn't around.
 Is he over there?"

<Girl>
"Nope~
 Where's Keiichi-san, I wonder?
 His dad is at the front gate."
That was definitely a lie.
The word, "gate," the same one I'd used, gave a hint of revenge.
 So Mion was behind this...!
I was still keeping one step ahead of the game.
 I felt bad for my underclassmen, but they'd have to search until the school bell.

<Girl>
"Hey, hey, do you know where Keiichi-san is at~?
 His mom suddenly got really sick~!"

<Girl>
"A message for Maebara-san.
 They said his house caught fire and he needs to come to the gate!"

<Girl>
"A jumbo jet fell on top of the Maebara residence!"

<Girl>
"The police have come to question him!"
...Anything goes now.

<Girl>
"They say he has a collection of dakimakura love pillows."
HaouUuh!?

<Girl>
"Is it true that he sleeps with them at night?"
Who were they talking about!?

<Girl>
"I heard he can't get enough of the fluffy soft sensation!"
No way I would do thaaat!!

<Girl>
"I heard he even has one with a photo of our Class Rep stuck to it~!"

<Girl>
"Whaaat!?"
GaaaaaaaAAaaRRRrrrrggh!!!!!
This was your doing, Mionnnnnnn!!!
C-Calm down, Keiichi Maebara!!
 This is Mion's battle tactic to flush me out!
 Just hold on!!
If my underclassmen thought about it logically, they would know it's all nonsense!
...But small kids don't think about things logically.
To them, all of those things were true, so they all chuckled together while looking for me.
Heheheheh...
 Bwahahahaha...!
 I win, Mion!
 It's my victory!
 Bwahahahaha...!!
Wiping unrelenting tears away, I felt intoxicated by my own victory...

<Girl>
"Did you hear?
 I heard that the new transfer student Maebara-san is into anime girls!
 Kyahahahaha!!"
The cost of beating Mion had too high a price...
Ah!
 ...Oh.
 Someone passed below.
That's... Rena and Rika-chan.

<Rena>
"...Haah haah.
 Rika-chan, you're still okay!?"

<Rika>
"...I'm getting by somehow."

<Rena>
"...Haah haah.
 ...It seems Mii-chan is 'it,' as well..."
Mion!?
 It couldn't be... She'd become 'it' because of my little strategy!?
This confirmed that Mion was behind this relentless message war.
 ...Then... This wasn't good...

<Rena>
"We finally got away from Mii-chan, but Satoko-chan... She's..."

<Rika>
"...Satoko is searching around the pipes... so we should be safe here for a while."
Upon hearing that, I breathed a sigh of relief.
While Rena was slumped on the ground breathing heavily, Rika-chan had started creeping up to her...
Rika-chan doesn't normally make noise when she walks...
 but it's strange.
 ...It couldn't be...

<Rena>
"Whoa!?
 ...Rika-chan?
 ...What is it? What is it!?
 ...Haoh...!?"

<Rika>
"...Don't worry."
I had never seen Rika-chan smile so creepily before.

<Rena>
"Wh-Why are you coming closer? Why!?
 Rika-chan isn't... a zombie, is she!?"

<Rika>
"...Don't be scared...
 I'll be sure to...
 eat you, gently."

<Rena>
"N-N-N-No way!?
 ...Rika-chan, no... Eeeek...!!"
Rena was pressed against the wall and Rika-chan lurched forward with both arms out, just like a zombie...
Rena quaked with her back pushed up against the wall.
It was quite a surreal scene of horror...
Like one of those zombie breakout videos you'd see.
At that moment, Rena's eyes met mine.

<Rena>
"K-Keiichi-kun! Save meeee!!!"

Zombie Rika-chan turned 180 degrees, Exorcist-style, and glared at me!

<Mion>
"Found him!! I see Kei-chan!!!!"
Mion popped out from behind the cinderblock wall around the garbage dump, also seeing where I was.
My position was only advantageous when there was one zombie. Being surrounded was not as good!!!

<Satoko>
"You said you located Keiichi-san~~!?!?"
I could tell that Satoko was rushing my way.
It seemed that Rika-chan had let Rena escape, and now she was baring her fangs in my direction.

<Keiichi>
"Uuurgh~... oooough~..."

<Mion>
"...Come~ on~ down~... Keiiiiiii-chaAaaAan..."
The three zombies circled the shed, moaning curses.

<Keiichi>
"Y... You guys are scary!!!
 Too scary!!!"

<Satoko>
"I wonder how Keiichi-san's guts taste!!
 Keichi-saAaAn...!"

<Rika>
"...Keiichi... I want you to become one of us."

<Keiichi>
"S-S-S-Someone please save meeeee!!!!!"
I saw Rena apologizing to me from across the schoolyard.
An apology.
 Sorry.
 Leaving me for dead?
 ...R-Renaaaa!!!!!
I leapt off the roof out of fear,
 slipping as I landed.

Satoko and Rika jumped on top of me and, after straddling me... they tickled me, all over my body.

<Keiichi>
"Gwa ha ha ha!!!
 Stop! Stop!!
 Gwaaaah!!!!!"

<Mion>
"...So this means Rena is still left.
 There isn't much time until the bell."

<Keiichi>
"...Damn you, Renaaa...!!
 How dare you... leave me for deaaaad!!"
The feelings of a zombie.
 I understood how vengeful ghosts with lingering regrets felt.

<Rika>
"...It's sad, so sad.
 ...But Keiichi is one of us now."
It felt like I'd been bitten by a vampire and was now one of their thralls.
It was a strange feeling, being welcomed over to the side that had pursued me.

<Keiichi>
"...Zombie tag is quite profound!"

<Satoko>
"This is no time to postulate!!
 We must capture Rena!!!"

<Mion>
"The principal is walking down the hall.
 ...The bell will ring soon!!"
To devour Rena... I, who had been turned into a demon of vengeance, needed to use any means necessary.
Except I wasn't just a zombie.
 I was a master of the night... A vampire!!
Using the same trick that had tightened the noose around my own neck, I used my classmates to further my evil designs.
I gathered up the lower grades from around the school grounds.

<Keiichi>
"Everyone, listen!
 Rena's in big trouble!
 All of you, please look for Rena!"

<Girl>
"...It's a bigger problem than a jumbo jet crashing into your family's house?"
...Oh, yeah, it had turned into that, hadn't it.
 Mion whistled nonchalantly, trying to avoid the blame.

<Keiichi>
"Yeah! It's not even in the same league as jumbo jets!
 What fell on Rena's house...

was a comet!!"


<Satoko>
"A-An asteroid!?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, the aliens deactivated the Roche limit with a device they created and started by hurling one asteroid.
 Even I didn't think that they'd go this far.
 And they plan to drop 100 of them next!! 

<Keiichi>
The Earth Federation was totally unprepared!!"

The lower grades were dumbfounded, their eyes like saucers at the grand turn of events...

<Girl>
"A... An Earth Federation...?
 Are we really at war with aliens?"

<Keiichi>
"If things go on like this, Earth is finished!!
 But don't despair!! If we have Rena's ultrasonic "Mach-Rena-Punch," it'll be possible to intercept all of the asteroids! 

<Keiichi>
That's right, the Earth Federation's top ace... is Rena Ryuugu!!"

<Girl>
"A-Amazing...!"

<Girl>
"So the older kids really ARE different!"
It seemed I'd made them fully understand that the fight for Earth was lost without Rena.

<Keiichi>
"Now scatter, comrades!! We must find Rena!!!"
My comrades in the lower grades let out an enthusiastic cheer and dashed off in various directions around the school grounds.
...Hm?
 There was still one person who hadn't gone.

<Girl>
"But... Rena-san might be strong... but, can she really push back the moon..?"

<Keiichi>
"Unnecessary concerns!
 Just days ago, Rena blew away a comet bomb that was going to smash into Earth.
 One or two hundred asteroids are nothing before one of her light-speed punches!"

<Girl>
"...Ryuugu-san is amazing..."
Satisfied with that, she also rushed off to look for Rena.
...It does seem... like there are some promising up-and-comers amongst the youngsters.

<Mion>
"...Little Kei-chan's abilities... this old man knows them better now..."
It didn't really feel like she was complimenting me, but whatever.

<Satoko>
"...Really, though... How exceptional, Keiichi-san...!!
 This looks quite promising!!"

<Mion>
"If we have this many... we can win!!
 With this many, we will win!!"

<Rika>
"...I was thinking that Keiichi would have been a better nominee for the initial zombie."
Rika-chan's words stung a bit, but I'd let it slide for now...
Not even Rena would be able to escape the entire class.
As a result of everyone's thorough search, Rena was finally cornered in the back of the sports equipment shed.

<Rena>
"Y-You're all scary!!
 Keiichi-kun, too...!!
 So scary!!!"
It probably was scary being chased around by the entire student body.
All the lower grades closed in on Rena, saying she was the only one who could save the world.

<Rena>
"What are you all saying!?
 I can't destroy asteroids by punching them!"

<Keiichi>
"Renaaa, how could you leave me for deeaad?!!
 Are you ready to pay for it...!?!?"

<Rena>
"I-I-I'm sorry about that, Keiichi-kun ...b-b-but I didn't have a choice...!!"

<Satoko>
"Do not resist... Let yourself be devoured~...!!!"

<Rika>
"...Let's all... be together."

<Mion>
"Now, Rena... Say your prayers!!
 Mwa ha ha!!!!!"
Rena had stumbled onto a mat, trembling, with tears in her eyes.
 I closed in.
Associating this situation with a similar, particularly immoral one made my pulse quicken just a little bit.
...Satoko and Rika-chan were both wiggling their fingers.
 They probably wanted to tickle Rena.
Rena, wanting no part of what she knew was about to happen, went stiff with fear.

<Rena>
"...K-Keiichi-kun... you wouldn't do mean things like everyone else... would you?
 ...Would you?"

<Keiichi>
"...I woOoOnder~!?!?"

<Rena>
"...Uu... ah... hau..."

<Keiichi>
"...Nowww then... Are you reaAaAady!?"

<Rena>
"...Okay... so long as it's Keiichi-kun..."
The face she made as she resigned herself to her fate made my heart skip a beat.

<Rena>
"I-I believe... that Keiichi-kun won't... do horrible things to me..."
...Argh... Body... won't move... That had to be some sort of anti-zombie mantra.
The second my sense of reason chimed in, the beast inside me died instantly.
There was the bell! Game over.

<Rena>
"Yaaay~~!!
 I did it, I did it!!
 I survived!
 Yaaay~ Yaaaa~y☆!!"
Rena pranced around merrily as if a curse had been broken.

<Keiichi>
"...Heh, so daylight broke in the nick of time and the evil zombie army disintegrated into dust...
 And so, the heroine survived... Well, that's how it goes in the movies, anyway..."

<Satoko>
"What are you postulating about!?
 This is all because Keiichi-san was dawdling about!"

<Rika>
"...Punishment is required."
I was subdued by Satoko and Rika-chan and once again sentenced to death by one hundred tickles.

<Keiichi>
"Eeeeeek! F-Forgive me! Eeeeeeek!"

<Mion>
"Then the award for surviving goes to Rena Ryuugu and Mion Sonozaki. Yaay!"

<Rena>
"Huh...? Mii-chan wasn't a zombie...?"

<Mion>
"Only pretended to be one. They say you need to deceive your allies before you can deceive the enemy, you know~?"

<Keiichi>
"...Uroooogh! Mion~ you little!"

<Mion>
"Yeah, yeah.
 Hurry up and change, all right~?
 Don't be late for the next class~!"

<Keiichi>
"Let go of me, Satoko! Rika-chan!!
 GwaaAaaAaa...ah...!!!!"
Having had my fill of being terrified to my very core by club activities, I solemnly swore I would have Mion crying for mercy next time.
After arriving home, I quickly made preparations to head out once again.
I had agreed to meet with Rena to dig Colonel Randy out of that mountain of treasure from before.

<Keiichi>
"Mom, do we have work gloves? I need towels, too."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Aren't they in the shed out back?
 The towels are by the sink."
All right. Now I was all ready.
 ...Looking at me, my mom stared quizzically.

<Keiichi's mom>
"What's going on, Keiichi?
 Where are you headed to in that getup...?"
If they come to dump again illegally, he'll be buried completely and it'll be impossible to dig him out, 
and if that happens... Rena will undoubtedly go after the Colonel Randy in front of the fried chicken place in town.

<Keiichi>
"A bit of excavating.
 So my classmate doesn't become a criminal."

<Keiichi's mom>
"...Well, don't be out too late."
Mom returned to the kitchen with a puzzled expression still on her face.
Cutting through the woods as a shortcut to the dam site, I ran into someone.
It was Tomitake-san.
Probably taking pictures of wild birds again with that precious camera of his.
...It couldn't be that all he took pictures of was handsome young men in the twilight...??

<Tomitake>
"Hey, long time no see.
 Keiichi-kun, right?"

<Keiichi>
"My due regards."
I expelled the rude imagery from my head and greeted him without inciting anything.

<Tomitake>
"By the way...
 Was that girl an acquaintance of yours...?"
He was probably talking about Rena.
 Guessing by the way Tomitake-san was shaken up...

<Tomitake>
"Wh-What was that all about!?
 She was walking around with a bared hatchet!
 And she was laughing with a huge smile across her face!!"
That was Rena, without a doubt.
I expect that she was grinning in anticipation of taking Colonel Randy home.

<Tomitake>
"I hid myself because I thought it might be dangerous
 ...
Should I call the cops to be safe...!?"
Well, it certainly would be quite the spectacle for a girl of her age to be roaming around with a hatchet.
Tomitake-san's reaction was the epitome of logical.

<Keiichi>
"It's fine, it's fine.
 Just leave her be.
 She's just wandering around looking for more victims."
Tomitake-san was alarmed by my crass response.
Well, it's probably hard for normal people to understand Rena.
 I'll just toss out a bunch of baloney.

<Keiichi>
"If you were to be killed out here, she'd probably be the one to do it.
 ...Try not to snoop too much around here."
With a condescending smirk, I started off in the direction of the dam site where Rena was waiting.
Before I got too far, Tomitake-san abruptly called out to me.

<Tomitake>
"Keiichi-kun, is that meant to be a warning for an outsider like me?"
...Uhhh, I didn't mean that seriously. I did try to make it obvious, but...

<Tomitake>
"Hah hah hah!
 I'll try my best to be careful."
Leaving only those words behind, Tomitake-san turned around and left.
I didn't really mean to call him an outsider...
 I wasn't really implying anything when I said that...
It was only meant to be a joke, but it felt like I'd said something bad...

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun~!
 I was waiting for you. Let's try our best today!"
I understood what Tomitake-san was trying to say.
Somebody gallivanting about while waving a hatchet around certainly would seem dangerous.

<Keiichi>
"You should put a cover on that hatchet when you have it in public.
 It's not good to carry it around out in the open like that!"

<Rena>
"Seems that I lost it... so there isn't one."
Thinking about it, there really was no need to try to keep up appearances.
Everyone in Hinamizawa probably already knew about Rena's eccentricities.
She's probably the only person who could carry a hatchet around Hinamizawa and not be considered suspicious...

<Keiichi>
"Ah well!
 Let's finish this today!
 If we bust through this last beam, we should be able to pull him out.
 I've got everything I need.
 Leave it to me!"

<Rena>
"Okay!"
I took the hatchet from Rena and made my way up the unstable slope.

<Rena>
"Just wait, Colonel Randy.
 Keiichi-kun will save you...☆"

<Keiichi>
"All right, get back.
 ...I'll finish this in one gooooo!"
A solid "thwack" rang through out Hinamizawa, as if the job was being done by a lumberjack.

<Rena>
"...How is it?
 Think you can do it?
 If it looks too hard, you don't have to strain yourself..."

<Keiichi>
"If I can break through this, then we'll be good!
 I have plenty of power today!
 I can do it!"
...But this adversary was more formidable than I expected.
First of all, I'd never used a hatchet before.
During a school camping trip, I had wanted to split the wood, but I lost at rock-paper-scissors and wasn't able to do it.
Because the spot where I was standing was so unstable, I soon became tired and decided to take a break.
Rena had already spread out a tarp and laid down some tea and sweets.

<Keiichi>
"I'm fine!
 I'm almost there.
 I'll make sure Rena can give Colonel Randy a good-night kiss tonight."

<Rena>
"...Yeah.
 ...Thanks.
 ...Giving Colonel Randy... a good night kiss... hau..."

<Keiichi>
"Come to think of it... Rena, you're a transfer student too, right?
 Where did you live before?"
I asked her nonchalantly while drinking tea.
I had thought she'd lived here all her life.

<Rena>
"Hm?
 In Kanto.
 It wasn't as rural as it is out here, but it was still out in the countryside."

<Keiichi>
"Why did you move here?
 To Hinamizawa, I mean.
 You know, this is pretty far out in the boonies."

<Rena>
"Why did you move here?
 Does it have to do with your dad's work?"

<Keiichi>
"Dad said he wanted to relocate his studio.
 He'd been saying for a while that somewhere deep in the mountains like this would be perfect."

<Rena>
"Studio? ...Is your father an artist or something??"

<Keiichi>
"He paints scenery.
 Seems that twice a year he opens a gallery for the stuff he does."
When he started, his works were displayed in an industry plaza in Tokyo, but now they're exhibited in the Makuhari Messe.
He's determined to have them displayed in the Waterfront International Exhibition Hall.

<Rena>
"That's amazing!
 Let me see them next time!"
...I was too embarrassed to tell her that I didn't really know what kind of pictures my father painted...
Well, eventually I would. I picked myself up while giving some vague answers.

<Rena>
"But... you transferred in the middle of the semester, didn't you?
 Wasn't that a hassle?"

<Keiichi>
"Not really.
 ...I was getting bored of the city anyway."
I was trying to get answers from Rena, but I ended up being the one giving out all the answers.
With a bit of a wry smile on my face, I grabbed the handle of the hatchet and headed back to worksite.
The air grew colder as the sun slowly set.
The higurashi began their song, as if to tell me to stop and head home for the day.
Just a bit more.
 Today... I would end it!
When I first started, I chatted with Rena as I worked, but now I didn't have that luxury.

<Keiichi>
"Hooyah!

 You little...!

 Damn it!"

I had swung the hatchet countless times today, just like this.
 Contact.
 Shards of wood splintered.
"The assailants butchered the victim's body with hatchets and pickaxes."
I recalled that passage from the tabloid.
One hit with something like this would smash someone's head in...
Axes and pickaxes are not meant to be swung at people, ever.
With one last swing, the beam cracked apart.
The weight I put behind the hatchet not only split through the beam, but smashed the statue's shoulder as well.
The arm came off with a sickening sound.
It clattered down noisily, stopping at my feet.

<Keiichi>
"...Ah."

<Rena>
"Wh-What's the matter!? Are you hurt!?"

<Keiichi>
"S-Sorry...
 The figure's arm... I broke it off..."

<Rena>
"...Oh, that's all? I thought Keiichi-kun hurt himself."
I probably had a really guilty look on my face.
 Rena said that without a hint of dismay as she smiled.

<Rena>
"We just need to tape it back on and put a coat over him.
 Nobody will even notice."

<Keiichi>
"...I see. Let's pull him out then.
 Can you get that side?"

<Rena>
"Okay!"
"...It was quite a disturbing incident... They still haven't found it, have they?"
In the dark, the doll just lying there felt a little too real, sort of like a bad omen... I came back to my senses and laughed dryly at how pathetic I was being.
Both Rena and Mion knew how sickening that incident was.
So they pretended that they didn't know.
I had looked it up all by myself.
...And shamefully enough, I was scared.

<Keiichi>
"...You're pathetic, Keiichi Maebara!
 All right, Rena!
 Let's do this in one go!
 Ready... and...!"

<Rena>
"...Whoa!
 We did it! We did it, Keiichi-kun!
 Yaaay!"
The right time to give three cheers!
 That moment of two days of work bearing fruit.
He who was brought to Hinamizawa covered in filth to meet his end. Instead, we were able to welcome him back.
You're pretty lucky, Colonel Randy. Your new master is a pretty decent person.

<Rena>
"...Waa... Colonel Randy... He really is kyute!"
It didn't matter that he was dirty. Rena nuzzled him cheerfully with her cheek.
I was dead tired, but seeing Rena's happy face made it all worth it.

<Keiichi>
"I'll help you carry it back. It'd be bad if it gets dark."

<Rena>
"...Yeah. Right!
 I really want to thank you, Keiichi-kun! I won't forget this!"

<Keiichi>
"I'll think real hard about how you can repay me!"

<Rena>
"Wh... Whoa... I wonder what kind of 'repayment'?
 ...I wonder?"
For now, I'd just hold back my evil cackle.
We were ready to take it to her house, but we couldn't go like this.
We rolled the statue up in the tarp and lifted him.
And so Jack and Jill went down the hill, carrying a human-sized bag and an unsheathed hatchet!
I prayed that we wouldn't run into Tomitake-san.
If he saw us here and took a picture... we'll need to get rid of him. (lol)
"...Is that meant to be a warning for an outsider like me?"
Something struck me as odd about the words Tomitake-san, unable to grasp my sense of humor, had left behind.



[Onikakushi Ch.5]


<Mion>
"Ahahaha! How was it, Kei-chan?"

<Satoko>
"So you went to Rena-san's house!
 Wasn't it amazing!?"

<Rena>
"Ahahaha... It's nothing like that, right...?
 Right?"
Unlike my house, the Ryuugu residence wasn't newly constructed. It had been renovated from a pre-existing building.
Well, the house itself was fine.
The problem was the yard.
There...
...
 it was crammed with...
 rows upon rows of oddities!
They were all the same as Colonel Randy: stuff you'd see while walking around in town.
The cake shop's mascot, Lil' Licky.
The Toadolmon in front of the pharmacy.
She even had The Amazing Flying Elephant from the top of the department store!

<Keiichi>
"I'll agree with you that those are cute,
 but why the mailbox!?
 Won't you get in trouble for that one!?"

<Rena>
"...But... hau... so kyute...☆"
She must have just thought about it, because her face filled with delight.

<Keiichi>
"So it's the bigger the better!
 Just as long as it's big!"

<Satoko>
"And her room displays the smaller ones.
 ...I had a chance to see them before."

<Keiichi>
"And kyute kids like Rika-chan are locked away in the basement?"

<Rena>
"...Yep, yep... I'll keep anything.☆
 Hau... kyute..."
 So she takes anything she likes back to her nest.
 No ill will intended.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Rena.
 You know about the Statue of Liberty in New York, right?
 ...Is that kyute?"

<Rena>
"...Yeah, kyute... hao... I want it..."
The US should probably come up with some countermeasures ASAP.
If not, the Statue of Liberty really will take a trip to Hinamizawa in the not-so-distant future...

<Rika>
"...My apologies for keeping you waiting."
Rika-chan had returned.

<Keiichi>
"No fun being called to the staff room.
 Did you do something?"

<Satoko>
"How rude! Rika isn't a hoodlum like Keiichi-san!"

<Rena>
"Ahaha.
 Nothing like that, Keiichi-kun.
 Rika-chan is a member of the Festival Committee."

<Keiichi>
"Festival?
 The school cultural festival or something?"

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, Kei-chan, I already told you.
 It's the village festival.
 The Watanagashi."
Oh, come to think of it, she did say there'd be a festival at the shrine during the next break.

<Keiichi>
"So what's this Watanagashi thing about?
 Is it like a floating lantern festival?"

<Mion>
"I guess the last part where you set things adrift in a river is similar."

<Rena>
"Except we use cotton things, like old worn-out futons and padded cloaks.
 It's a festival expressing thanks for their years of service."
The people living in Hinamizawa dump their futons and padded cloaks in a stream...??
It sounds like it'd be a lot of trouble if it backed up the current...
Maybe they should just drop some fish in and have a fish-wrangling competition.
...Skewer them and sprinkle a little salt... Oh man, I could smell it already...!

<Satoko>
"That's just summer camp!
 I never anticipated how destitute Keiichi-san's imaginative capabilities would actually be~."

<Keiichi>
"Wh-Wha!?
 How could you tell I was thinking something silly!?"

<Rika>
"...It was written all over your face."
What sort of face could have expressed what I'd imagined just now...!?
Rena demonstrated for me.
...I see. No argument here.

<Mion>
"Hahahahaha!
 It's nothing fun like that, you see.
 But you should still look forward to it."

<Rena>
"Let's all go together.
 I'll come get you that day!"
I don't really feel like going to festivals unless someone asks me to.
 I wouldn't get bored if these guys were going.

<Mion>
"You won't get bored!
 We're doing it again this year!!"
Mion's proclamation came as she looked at each member in turn.
What was this all about?
...From the way Mion looked... it was probably...

<Mion>
"Our club's summer tradition!
 The Watanagashi Four-Demon Fire Fight!"


<Keiichi>
"Th-That sounds awful!
 What kind of name is that!?"

<Rena>
"...I-I think it's a kyute name, though..."
I tried to object sharply, but, since Rena looked happy about it, I decided it was pointless to fight it.

<Rika>
"...Since Keiichi is here this year, it becomes five demons."
 Rika-chan made a small correction in light of my presence.

<Keiichi>
"So... How does this funky-sounding club activity tie in to the festival?"

<Satoko>
"Oh ho ho!
 This is where you exhibit the skills you've nurtured through your daily club activities!"

<Mion>
"Exactly!
 We show the full extent of the abilities that the best of the best have obtained through our daily trials and tribulations...!!"

<Rena>
"But last year the mayor got angry...
 so we need to make sure not to cause any problems this time..."

<Rika>
"...So basically we're doing club activities while checking out the stalls."
...Rika-chan really is the only one who explains things so they make sense.
I see... So we'll be 'exhibiting' on those busy festival grounds.
 Rena was right, of course that would be a reason for the mayor to get angry!

<Rena>
"Ahaha... but it's lots of fun!"
That was the only point I did not doubt.
It would be, without question, fun.
The day of the festival was drawing near.

<Mion>
"Well, putting that aside for now...
 Let's start our club activities today! Any objections!?"

<Club Members>
"""Naaay!"""
Our voices rang out in unison.

<Mion>
"When there's lots of people, card games really are the easiest to play!
 This really is the most basic of table games!"

<Keiichi>
"Playing with the marked deck again!?"

<Mion>
"We'll use a new one today.
 There are no marks on the cards, so we're on equal footing!"

<Satoko>
"I wonder if that really is the case...
 I will have to inspect them!"
Well, that was fair. Just to be safe, everyone checked the cards.

<Rena>
"Yes. These seem to be fine!"

<Mion>
"Are you all satisfied?
 Then today, I guess
 ...
 we'll play President. That's good for five people!"
Another standard card game.
First one to get rid of all their cards wins.
The basic rules: play a better card than the one before.
You can play straights and pairs. There are various techniques that improve the game, like reversals.
But because it's such a well-known game, there are lots of house rules for it as well.
The name, for example.
In my hometown, we called it "Millionaire."

<Keiichi>
"I'd like to go over some details.
 Are the jokers wild?
 Can you make a reversal with three Threes?"

<Mion>
"No jokers.
 Two is the highest.
 You can reverse a reversal.
 You can only make a reversal with four-of-a-kind, not three."

<Rena>
"Also, you know how the Peasant sends a good card to the President?
 None of that."
While I was confirming the familiar rules, Satoko looked over at me cautiously...
I probably should have tried to look like more of an amateur.
I was pretty used to this game!
It's President, and it's with a new deck.
 Today... I might be able to win!
I had the gist of the rules now...
 But that wasn't everything, was it?

<Satoko>
"So, what shall today's penalty be!?"

<Mion>
"About that... Why don't we all write something down on slips of paper and have the loser draw one?"
Oh!
 That seemed like it could be interesting!

<Satoko>
"Oh ho ho ho!
 I'll write a naaasty one and have Keiichi-san draw it!"

<Rena>
"I-It would be awful if you wrote a bad one and drew it yourself."

<Keiichi>
"Just don't lose!"

<Satoko>
"Don't you know best? Oh ho ho!"
Mion handed out several slips of paper to everybody.

<Mion>
"Then write down whatever and put it in this bag.
 When you lose, stick your hand inside, and pick one out."
Now, then, what would be a good penalty?
Worst case scenario, you'd draw what you wrote.
...Something too intense would be like digging your own grave.

<Rika>
"...'No penalty,'
 Let's forbid that kind of idea from being written down."
Rika-chan's casual suggestion caused Mion's hand to lurch to a sudden halt.

<Satoko>
"Aaaah! That's so sneaky, Mion-san!
 She wrote, 'no penalty,' and the corner of the slip is folded!"
I see...
Just in case you lost, just grab the note with the folded corner and you'd be safe.
...That was a good idea.
Diabolical as ever, Mion!
Rika-chan is quite formidable too, being able to see through that.
I couldn't underestimate her even though she doesn't stand out.

<Rena>
"Everyone... D-Don't write penalties that are too mean, okay...?"
Nobody agreed to Rena's proposal...
 Everyone was ruthless.

<Keiichi>
"It's fine, Rena.
 Just don't lose!"

<Rena>
"...Y-Yeah. That's true.
 Okay! I'll try hard so everyone has to pick the penalty I write!"
Rena was quite brutal even though she usually appeared meek.
 Better not underestimate her either.

<Satoko>
"I agree with that...
 I'm very curious what Rena's penalty is in particular!"

<Rika>
"...Everybody's penalties are scary."
I still didn't know what Rika-chan's penalties would be like.

<Mion>
"Basically...
 You can't afford to lose this game!!
 Everybody here ready!?"
We all nodded determinedly.
Having confirmed that, Mion dealt out the cards.
...Finally... the battle begins!
I had a decent starting hand.
Card after card was played in the middle.
Not needing Mion to tell them, both Rika-chan and Satoko played their cards without hesitation.
Rena and I were the only ones who paused to think.
It seemed that Rena genuinely couldn't make up her mind...
 But I was different!
I was like a shark stalking its prey, just waiting for the right time to strike.

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 Will this work?
 Then I'll play this Three, and I'm out!"

<Satoko>
"Nine!
 Nobody!?
 Eight!
 Seven!
 I'm out!"

<Rika>
"...Five and Five.
 I'm out."

<Rena>
"Then I'll discard this last one, and I'm out!"

<Mion>
"Bah...!
 I missed my chance...!"
The loser of the first round... was, of all people, Mion!
 And now I was certain...
Today... I could win!!!

<Rena>
"Now, now then!
 Mii-chan, pull out one of the slips, okay~?"
Mion, accepting her defeat, scrounged around inside the bag and pulled out one piece of paper.

<Mion>
"...Wha!?
 Who did this!?
 Who wrote thiiiiis!?"
Mion quivered and shrieked.

<Rena>
"...Um, what is it?
 What is it?
 ...
 Haoh!?"
Rena was also surprised when she peeked at it.
...What kind of terrible thing was written on it!?
"Pet the principal on the head."

<Keiichi>
"...Hey, wait.
 How is this bad?"

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san, do you not understand!?!
 The principal is ashamed of his thinning hair!!"
Satoko yelled with a serious look on her face.
But she wasn't as loud as Mion's shriek.
What could it be...?

<Rika>
"...The principal is a martial arts master."

<Satoko>
"He boasts about traveling around the world perfecting his skills when he was younger."

<Rena>
"He switched to teaching after seeing the poor state of education in Japan after the war..."
He was inhuman.
 ...Pet that guy's head...?

<Mion>
"As the club president, there is no way I can set a bad example by refusing...
 phew.
 ...Hoo Yaaaaaaah!!"
She bellowed out a yell as she dashed off down the hallway.

<Keiichi>
"...Wouldn't it have been easier to sneak out quietly and try to do it without making a fuss?"

<Rena>
"Probably impossible...
 They say he used to hunt sea slugs just by sensing their presence."
I could do nothing but wait with bated breath.
Ker
 Poooow!
 A rumble shook the classroom!

<Rika>
"...The principal's special launcher move just started."
Boof pow whap!!
Zazhing!
 KaboOoOom!!!
Such perfect flow in a combo!?
 He's even using followers on the KO'd opponent!!!

<Keiichi>
"That's Jeet Kune Do, right?"

<Rena>
"I-I don't want to know... I don't want to know...!!"
Nothing I could do now except stay calm.
 ...I understood now why there were no delinquents at this school.
After a few moments of silence, Mion slumped back to us.

<Mion>
"...Petted.
 ...Is that...
 good enough...!?"
Mion said before collapsing.

<Satoko>
"She's alive, at least.
 Now we can continue the game!!"

<Mion>
"...M...
 monster..."
I was amazed the person who made club activities like these could say that.

<Rena>
"But now!
 The worst penalty is gone now, right?
 Right!?"
Rena tried to lighten the mood, and was only met with Mion's malicious grin...
 She was serious now.

<Mion>
"I'm not holding back anymore!
 You'll all get yours!"
The pace of the game became bizarrely quick.
 I could tell the game had gotten more intense.

<Mion>
"Ace!
 Three, Four, Five!! I'm out!!"

<Rika>
"...I'm out as well."

<Keiichi>
"Heheh! I'm out too!"

<Satoko>
"Three! I am now out!"

<Rena>
"Eek!! I-I loOoOost...!?"
...And the heavens chose to vanquish Rena.

<Rena>
"Wh... What kind of penalty, I wonder...? What kind of penalty, I wonder...!?"
It wasn't exactly hard for her to be worried...
Just thinking of the level of difficulty of Mion's first penalty still made me quiver...
And so... the penalty she drew with trembling fingers was...!
...The heck was this.
"Speak like a maid."

<Rena>
"Huh!? Wh-What is this!?
 ...This one... what do I need to do?"

<Satoko>
"...So basically... It means that you have to use the same expressions as a maid...?"

<Rena>
"Ha... hao...
 okay
 ...
Master..."
It hit me like a tonne of bricks.
 ...I-I had no idea who wrote that penalty, but she was awesome!

<Keiichi>
"Th-Then, Rena, can you... shuffle the cards and deal...?"

<Rena>
"Y-Yes... Master..."
Ah~ I could just die right now♪!!

<Keiichi>
"A-A-A-Anyway, let's continue!
 Right, Rena!?"

<Rena>
"...Yes, Master..."
The eagerness to which I was goading Rena into addressing me as Master was downright impressive, if I do say so myself.

<Mion>
"Hoyah!
 I won't lose anymore! I'm out!"

<Satoko>
"I shan't lose either!"

<Rika>
"...I'm out."

<Keiichi>
"Then with that... I'm out, too!"

<Rena>
"I-I can't believe it!!
 Is it Rena's loss again!?"
Rena again...! What kind of penalty would it be this time...?
I was delighted by the mysterious sense of anticipation.
...Anticipation?
 No, this was conviction!!
"Remove one item of clothing from the top and bottom halves of your body."

<Keiichi>
"Th-Th-Th-That's just indecent!!
 Who could have written this!?"
My face reddened in anger.
 If I didn't yell something out, I wouldn't be able to hide my shaking!
Ahh, who DID write that!?
 God, please give that man a Nobel Prize!!

<Satoko>
"That would be an Ignoble Prize."
Not good not good, what I was thinking about was written on my face.

<Rena>
"...Hau... uu... Mii-chan..."
Rena begged Mion with teary eyes... but everyone knew Mion's answer already.

<Mion>
"Nope, nope! Won't go easy on you!!
 You lost, so take it like a man!"

<Rena>
"...U-Understood, Master... .Hau... I'll... I'll undress..."
Wh-Whaaaaa!?!?
 I looked around, thinking someone else would probably stop her. Of course, I wasn't exactly trying to stop her either!!
Then I heard the rustling of clothing
 ...
 The sound of her skirt hitting the ground sent my heart racing!

<Rena>
"I-Is this... fine... M...
 Master...?"
I looked away like a gentleman.
...B-But these club activities... You needed to be ruthless, after all...!

<Keiichi>
"Ah...
 O-Oh...Ahahaha... ha."

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san, whatever were you expecting!?
 Certainly we would not have her strip if she weren't wearing her PE clothes underneath!"
Satoko poked fun at me but right now I can't hear it...!

<Mion>
"Not bad, Kei-chan~!!
 This old man never even thought you would go after her like that."

<Keiichi>
"Y-Y-You... You've got it wrong! I didn't write that one!"

<Rena>
"M-Master... didn't write this one...?"
H-Her squirming around in her PE clothes made it impossible for me to not feel anything...
C-Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...!
Mion probably wrote that one and planned to go after me as I panicked!!
You can't fall for her trap after knowing it's a trap!
 Clear your head!
 Calm down and assess the situation...!
I was determined to think my way out of this.
...And the answer was quite simple.

<Keiichi>
"I... I WIIIIN!"
I then became a god!
I, who had already entered the domain of godhood... What would dare stand in my way!?
It was like they were pulled to me magnetically... I was picking up Aces and Twos like nobody's business!!

<Satoko>
"...Eek!?
 How could my luck of the draw be so bad!?"

<Keiichi>
"Satoko lost, right?
 I'll draw the penalty.
 'Speak like a little sister'!!!!"

<Satoko>
"Uuugh!!
 ...Fine,
 Onii-chan... ghhhk!"
Yessss!
 The pleasure of making this brat disgrace herself!

<Mion>
"Augh!
 ...This old man loses again!"

<Keiichi>
"Mion's loss, right?
 I'll draw it out.
 'Wear a girl's school swimsuit'!!!!"

<Mion>
"Nooooo!
 That's the one I wanted Kei-chan to get!"
Yessss!
 Mion's despair was like sweet honey!

<Rena>
"M-Master... I-I lost again...!"

<Keiichi>
"Rena lost?
 I'll draw it for you.
 'Let the person in first place rest their head on your lap'!!!"

<Rena>
"...Hu
 hao...
 ...
 In this outfit... Master...?"
Yeaaaaah!
 She's not wearing a skirt, so it's her bare legs!♪

<Satoko>
"Eek!!
 Onii-chan... You're too good... sniffle."

<Keiichi>
"Satoko lost again?
 I'll draw it.
 'Obey the person in first place'!!
 How about I have you give me a shoulder massage!?"

<Satoko>
"Fine, Onii-chan..."

<Keiichi>
"Come on, do it a bit harder!
 Don't use your nailssss!
 Bwa ha ha ha~♪!"
I had transformed into an evil dictator and couldn't be doing any better!
It felt like I could control how the cards played out with my mind, and even decide what suits would appear just by willing it!
...By the time I realized it, I had already assembled a harem.
I was laughing haughtily as I rested my head on Rena, who was now a bloomer-clad maid.
Satoko was wearing a collar and had taken on little sister properties.
Mion was fanning me while wearing a school swimsuit.

<Rena>
"Hau... To-Today is Master's overwhelming victory, isn't it...
 ...Eeek!
 Please refrain from moving your head around so much..."
I began to think.
...Why does man have no end to his desires?
How could I wish for more than this Palace of Dreams!?

<Rika>
"...What is it, Keiichi?"

<Keiichi>
"I'm saddened by the thought of a man having no end to his desires."
That was it.
Rika-chan hadn't been in first, but she continued to escape being in last.

<Rika>
"...Keiichi is quite greedy.
 It's said you should know when enough is enough."

<Keiichi>
"I know that very well.
 ...But how to say it...
 I feel like I wouldn't mind if I died now.♪♪♪"

<Rena>
"Eeeek!
 Master... please refrain from moving your head around
...
 Eeek!

<Rika>
"...You say you wouldn't mind dying.
 ...Then that can be arranged."
Rika-chan said it in her usual calm manner with a cheery tone.
...This was undoubtedly... a declaration of war...!

<Mion>
"Go, Rika-chan, go!! Take him out!!"

<Satoko>
"Defeat this Archdevil of Perversion~!"

<Rika>
"I might not be able to win... but I'll beat him."
Such stoicism from this little girl who's always hidden away in Satoko's shadow!
It would probably be rude not to meet her head-on.
...I shall face you myself, little one!
I saw Mion swap a few cards with Rika-chan in the middle of the game, but pretended I didn't see it.
...Do you believe you can defeat Keiichi-sama with just thaaaat!?

<Rika>
"...Two.
 Ace, Ace, Ace.
 Eight, Eight, Eight, Eight. Reversal."
Everybody looked over at me. I was still brimming with confidence.
...Mwahaha!
 The four of them have allied against me... That's it? ...You're making me laugh!

<Keiichi>
"That was good.
 ...REVERSAL REVERSAL!"

<Satoko>
"Wuuuh!?
 How could such a thing be...!?!?!"
Satoko let out a shriek!
...Mwahaha!
 You simpletons!!!
Using up all of her cards before calling the reversal left Rika-chan with no good cards!!
She was defeated soon after.

<Rika>
"...I... lost..."

<Keiichi>
"Bwa ha ha ha!!!
 Finally, you fall into my clutches!
 Now I'll pick one out!!
 Uowwoh!?"
"Wear cat ears, a bell collar, and a tail."
Mwahaha!
 Even the penalties were as I wished!!!
Rika-chan hung her head and equipped the three holy artifacts.
It's questionable as to why such things were in Mion's locker but, since I had no objections, I didn't ask.
Uoh!
 Th-This was so!!
 ...Hau~~!!
It felt like I had become Rena...! This was definitely... ky-kyute...♪♪♪

<Rena>
"Kyute, isn't it?? Isn't it!?
 ...Hau... I want to take her home...☆"
That wasn't me talking. That was the actual Rena.

<Rika>
"...Meep..."
As Rika-chan mimicked a cat, teary-eyed, rings of smoke
 escaped from Rena's ears with an audible "poof!"

<Rena>
"...Rika-chan... Must take home... Taking her home...☆
 ...Just... Just for a while.☆ I-I won't do anything strange... nothing strange...☆"

<Mion>
"I-I see... I still have one trick left...!"
Mion gasped and dropped her fist into her open palm.

<Rika>
"If Rena must... she can take me home."

<Satoko>
"After Rena-san beats Keiichi-san she caaan!!!"
They thought that Rena in 'Kyute Mode' would be able to defeat me!
Would it be that easy!?!?
Opposing me was the same as opposing God!! I'd teach them their place!!!

<Keiichi>
"How preposterous!!
 That Rena can't defeat me
...
 ...eep!?"
For a moment, I didn't know what was going on.
The 52 cards danced and flowed freely between Rena's hands like the machinations of a master magician.
In the middle of those flowing cards was Rena's ecstatic expression, her head bobbing around...!!

<Rena>
"Sh...Sha-Sha-Sha-Shall we, Keiichi-kun... Hurry, hurry!"
My whole body knew it already.
 ...I was...
 Going to lose.

<Mion>
"No play!?
 Nothing to play, Kei-chan!?
 ...Then with this... I'm oout!!!"
Everyone cheered. I was spent.

<Keiichi>
"Phew... I've got no regrets... God... thank you for letting me dream a little."

<Satoko>
"Now then! I'll take one out!
 Keiichi-san's penalty!
 ...This is it!!"
Everybody peeked at it in unison, gazes flicking between the text and my face.

<Keiichi>
"All day today I did as I pleased. ...I'll do whatever it is. What's on there?"

<Mion>
"All."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?"
"Every penalty up until now."

<Keiichi>
"Wha
 ...What the heeeeck!?"

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san, should you not be speaking like a little brother!?"

<Keiichi>
"Ugh! ...Yes, onee-chan.
 ...Uuugh!!!"

<Satoko>
"Uwaoah...☆ Th-This is quite addicting!
 Next I'll have you rub my shoulders!!"

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, I don't need the lap pillow... So do that other one, okay?"

<Keiichi>
"Urgh... Y-Yes, Master..."

<Rena>
"H-hau...!
 Keiichi-kun... Th-That's shou kyute... Say it again? Say it again!?"

<Keiichi>
"Nyuu, please spare me, Master~...!"
Rena passed out with a squeal, blood spewing from her nose like a fountain.
My dignity was being trampled more than a communal doormat.

<Mion>
"Next is from this old man!
 I'm going to have you fan me for a good looong while, you know!?"
Fwoosh fwoosh!!!

<Mion>
"...Oh, almost forgot.
 You need to wear this, don't you?
 The school swimsuit.☆"

<Keiichi>
"H-Haouh!?!?
 This is for girls!?
 Can't I wear the one for boys!?"

<Satoko>
"It was clearly written here, 'Wear a girl's school swimsuit,' as you can see!!!!"
Satoko was like a loan shark.
...Actually, me trying to escape reality as fast as humanly possible was pretty adorable, if I did say so myself.

<Keiichi>
"B-B-But,
 whose school swimsuit am I going to wear!?
 If I were wearing one of yours...
 You wouldn't like it right?!"

<Mion>
"Ah, this old man doesn't care about that kind of stuff at all. ☆
 Think of it as a little benefit!
 I'm not that in shape, so I think even Kei-chan can fit into it!!"
The executioners surrounded me, wagging their fingers.

<Keiichi>
"N-N
...
 Nooooooooo!!!"
My first thought... It's tight around the waist.
 Second thought. The chest area was pretty loose...
 ...... Don't make me elaborate any more!

<Rena>
"Ahahaha~ Keiichi-kun is so... kyute kyute!!"

<Rika>
"...You'll be ready after you wear the cat ears, bell, and tail."

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, wanna look in the mirror? ...It's amazing, really.
 It's probably best if you look."
The stern, scientific, calculating nature mixed in with her fascination made Mion very scary.

<Keiichi>
"Uh... I would like to respectfully decline, Master..."

<Satoko>
"Your ensemble is complete!
 If only we could send you home dressed like that! Ooh~ ho ho ho!!"

<Keiichi>
"Then... I-Is this enough? I'll change and..."
While I was saying that, Mion placed her hands on my shoulders and Rika-chan slipped up behind me without a sound.

<Rika>
"...Not yet, Keiichi...
 There's still the first penalty left."

<Keiichi>
"...In this... get-up?"
Rika-chan patted my head without saying a word...

<Keiichi>
"Sir!! Excuse me!!"

<Principal>
"Yes. Please come in."
I stepped forwards into the principal's office. My bell collar jingled adorably.
The principal froze solid with a smile on his face as he saw me.
I couldn't blame him.
In this sacred place of study, specifically, in his office...
Though I said "excuse me" as I entered... the sight of a person entering with a school swimsuit, cat ears, a collar, and a tail...
And for it to be a young male student...
Without a doubt, any normal person's psyche would have stopped cold...
But this could be explained.
We'll call it "Uncanny Valley Camouflage," if you will.
When humans see others, they can only begin to act after confirming "this is human."
...Meaning that if he could not comprehend what was in front of him, then in those moments before he could begin to fully process the situation... his mind was completely blank...!!!
That was my one and only chance for victory...!
My penalty...
Rubbing the principal's head!

<Keiichi>
"Princi
paaaAaaAal!!!
 I challenge you...
 hurRrk!!!!!!"
A "zhazhing" sound echoed loudly.  He went straight for the special move!?
The principal said one thing to me.

<Principal>
"What does it mean to be a man...?"
And in a heartbeat...
Bo
OooOoOooooof...!!

That tremor resounded throughout the Hinamizawan twilight...
Rena was given permission to caress Rika-chan's head as much as she wanted, so they headed home together, very pleased.
Once again today, it was just Mion and I going home.

<Mion>
"Maan... That was intense! I didn't know Kei-chan was so good at President!"

<Keiichi>
"No, I was more surprised than anyone."
If I was playing with guys, I wouldn't have been that strong...

<Keiichi>
"But still... It was pretty bad...
 Being carried off on a stretcher in that outfit will probably haunt me until the day I die."

<Mion>
"Ahaha!
 But that's fine, isn't it?
 You were able to do something to boast about for the ages too!"
Hau...
 Well, when she says it like that... We both smiled at each other.

<Tomitake>
"Oh, we meet again, Keiichi-kun."
It was Tomitake-san.
It felt like I'd been running into him quite often.

<Mion>
"Hey. Take any good pictures?"

<Tomitake>
"Well, a few.
 So..."
Tomitake-san suddenly leaned over and whispered into my ear.

<Tomitake>
"You sure get around.
 Today you already have a different girl!?"

<Keiichi>
"I-It's not like that!"

<Tomitake>
"No need to hide it!
 It's important to get lots of experience when you're young~!"
Because Tomitake-san let out such a crude laugh, Mion knew what we were talking about without even hearing his whispering.

<Mion>
"I've heard through the grapevine that Mr. Tomitake isn't doing so badly himself, hmm?"

<Tomitake>
"Huh, no, that wasn't my intention...!"

<Mion>
"Sure, sure.
 Keep up the good work and take plenty of pictures~!
 See ya!"
Mion seemed to really want to get rid of this lout quickly.
From the way she spoke... it seemed as if Mion knew Tomitake-san quite well.

<Mion>
"How's the year treating you, mister? Staying until the Watanagashi?"

<Tomitake>
"Yep, I plan to.
 After photographing the festival, I plan on heading back to Tokyo."

<Mion>
"Being a photographer sure is easy!
 Be sure to win some big award and become famous!
 You spent all your best years on photography, after all!"

<Tomitake>
"I-I don't think I'm that far gone!
 Don't they say men start developing their own unique flavor in their thirties...?"

<Mion>
"What does it matter what you taste like? That's so gross!"

<Tomitake>
"Mm, ah, ahahahaha!
 Oh, look at the time. I need to get back to the inn before it gets dark!"
Tomitake-san began to take his leave with a dry laugh.
It did look like he was outmatched by Mion.

<Tomitake>
"Now then. I'll see you both at the festival."
After waving a hand cheerfully, Tomitake-san disappeared amidst the cries of the higurashi.

<Mion>
"The way he's going, he probably won't ever get famous.
 I had him promise he'd display a picture of me if he ever opened up a gallery, but...
 I don't think that'll ever happen."

<Keiichi>
"So you know Tomitake-san."

<Mion>
"Yeah, he's an acquaintance of sorts. But you know how easy it is to tell who's an outsider."

<Keiichi>
"It sounded like you meet him all the time."

<Mion>
"Tomitake-san comes around to Hinamizawa regularly.
 Maybe two, three times a year? 

<Mion>
He says he's taking pictures of the seasonal scenery and wild birds. But well, those photos really are nothing to phone home about!"
The image Mion painted of Tomitake-san was fairly unique.
The Tomitake-san I knew... was more mysterious.
The words flowed naturally from my mouth.

<Keiichi>
"...I wonder if he's really here to take pictures of birds."
Mion stared blankly at me as if to ask, "why do you say that?"

<Keiichi>
"It just seems... he's here for something other than taking pictures... I think...
 Don't you get that feeling?"
Like about... that incident... the dismemberment...

<Mion>
"Oh? You too?
 ...If so, you've got good instincts, Kei-chan~!"
She agreed with what I thought, but was quite chipper in how she said it.

<Keiichi>
"You knew about it then, Mion?"

<Mion>
"Of course~!
 He might be able to pull one over on everyone else... but he can't fool this old man~... ☆"
Mion was posturing pretentiously, but I had easily come to a very different conclusion from what she was imagining.
It felt like all apprehensions I had about Tomitake-san disappeared, lifting a burden off my shoulders.
I was finally able to appreciate how clear the evening sky over Hinamizawa was.

<Keiichi>
"...Ahhhh~!!"
I exhaled everything in my lungs and inhaled just as much.
 It smelled like dusk.

<Mion>
"What is it, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"It's just that...
 I never thought the cries of the higurashi could feel this good."

<Mion>
"Ahahahaha! What's gotten into you all of a sudden, Kei-chan?"
We both continued to giggle, not knowing why.

<Keiichi>
"I wonder what Rena is doing.
 I bet she's getting her fill of Rika-chan by now."

<Mion>
"She's probably in the middle of asking her over so she can treat her to dinner."

<Keiichi>
"It'd be great if she's able to take her home."

<Mion>
"I wonder.
 Rika-chan is pretty good at that stuff!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, I feel the same!
 That head-petting penalty was probably from Rika-chan."

<Mion>
"I thought so, too~!
 The only one who could get away with patting his head is Rika-chan, after all."
Just pointless chitchat.
The hot day felt like it was being cooled down by the cries of the higurashi.



[Onikakushi Ch.6]

A few days had passed since the incident.
During that time either Mion was busy or Rika-chan had to help with the festival preparations, so we couldn't get everybody together for club activities.
Even though I thought I would never want to participate again after the years it shaved off my life each time, not having it only made my heart grow fonder.
...I really am not honest with myself.
Today we finally had our club activities again.
These weren't the same old club activities.
It was called the Watanagashi Five-Demon Fire Fight!!
And it was one of the biggest events in the club.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi~
 Does this yukata still fit you?
 Can you try it on for a second?"
Mom pulled out an old, dusty yukata.

<Keiichi>
"Nah, I don't need a yukata...
 Those are embarrassing, so I'll just go in my normal clothes."

<Keiichi's mom>
"But this is a festival. Wear it, okay?"

<Keiichi>
"Rena and the others said regular clothes are just fine.
 If I was the only one wearing a yukata, it'd be even more embarrassing!"
I put on the same old vest as usual.

<Keiichi>
"I'll be going with Rena and the others,
 so you don't need to worry about me."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Is that so?
 I'll be going with Dad when he wakes up."
Dad let out a loud snore from the sofa.

<Keiichi>
"From how it looks... he must've pulled an all-nighter last night."

<Keiichi's mom>
"He just finished sending in his manuscript.
 So he might not wake up for a while..."
It seems my dad writes for art magazines sometimes, too.
...I've never read it, though.
I wonder if my dad... is a really famous artist.
...As his son, it's a bit strange for me to say, but I can't imagine he's selling all that well.
But he's able to feed a family of three, and my life isn't exactly full of hardships.
Maybe he's actually a master painter... and I just never knew it...
Ding dong~~!


<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun, are you home~~!?"
Uh-oh! It was already time!
I didn't want them coming here, so I was planning on leaving early and waiting outside...!!

<Keiichi's mom>
"Oh my, it's Rena-chan!
 Thank you for always looking after Keiichi...!"

<Rena>
"Ah... M-Ma'am... H-He's also... b-been looking... out for..."
Why are you blushing just from meeting my mom!?

<Keiichi>
"Don't get all flustered!
 This feels so awkward!
 Let's go, Rena!"
Since Rena would continue to space out if I left her here, I grabbed her hand and dragged her out.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Rena-chan~! Look after Keiichi for me~!"

<Rena>
"Hao!... Yes, Ma'am~~~!
 Even if it means I must sacrifice myself~.☆"
Then why don't you do it right now!?
She waved back even as I was dragging her away.

<Mion>
"Okay~, Kei-chan!
 You hungry today?
 We'll take care of that at these stalls!"

<Keiichi>
"You thought I'd let myself get full knowing the club activities will involve the stalls!!?"

<Mion>
"Wouldn't have it any other way!"

<Keiichi>
"Where are Rika-chan and Satoko?
 Are they already at the temple?"

<Rena>
"Yep! Rika-chan's a festival committee member after all.
 Satoko-chan is probably with her as well."

<Keiichi>
"I see.
 ...
All right!
 Let's make some noise today!!"

<Mion>
""Yeah~~~~~!!!!""
We were already in high spirits with just the three of us there.
It was way more lively at the Furude shrine than the last time I came, far exceeding my expectations.
Throngs of people were crammed between rows of market stalls lined with colorful paper lanterns.  Despite that, it was actually quite enjoyable.

<Keiichi>
"There sure are lots of people here!!
 I can't believe they all live in Hinamizawa..."

<Rena>
"Everybody attends the Watanagashi.
 I think about half the village is here."

<Mion>
"It's not just that.
 Municipal and youth councils from neighboring towns and villages advertise this event as well."

<Keiichi>
"That's right.
 There aren't that many students at our school.
 But there's a lot of kids here today."

<Mion>
"It just doesn't feel like a festival unless there are kids running around, after all."
That's true. I agree.

<Rena>
"Ah, hello and good evening~!"
These two knew everybody we came across.
Of course I greeted them as well, but I still wasn't familiar with everybody yet.

<Villager>
"Oh, Rena-chan.
 Thanks for the food you brought me a while back!
 My son loved it. He said it was delicious."

<Rena>
"Ah, it was nothing at all.☆
 I'm glad he liked it.
 Say hello to Kazumasa-kun for me, please!"

<Festival Stall>
"Hey!
 If it isn't Sonozaki-ojouchan!
 I'm in charge of a stand again this year, so make sure you come visit!!"

<Mion>
"Pops, have you gotten fatter!?
 You'll end up having a heart attack with a gut like that!"

<Festival Stall>
"Oh. This kid here is new.
 Are you one of her underclassmen!?"

<Mion>
"He's one of my members.
 ...An upcoming hopeful!  If you cross him, he could crush your stand in one night!"

<Festival Stall>
"You've got little missy's seal of approval, I see! Hope you take it easy on me~!!!"
As you could imagine, Mion was chatting away with the old guys running the stalls.

<Rena>
"Mii-chan is really energetic, after all.
 She's really popular with the older men."

<Keiichi>
"I think Rena is pretty popular too.
 Being cute and all."
That was, of course, so long as her little 'condition' didn't flare up.
But as long as she's blushing quietly, she's pretty cute.

<Rena>
"...Uhh? ...I'm...
 popular with some people? Really?
 Really!?"

<Keiichi>
"With some people."
I evaded giving her a straight answer by roughly tousling her hair.

<Mion>
"The stall keepers came all the way from town.
 It's not really a festival without them, after all!!"

<Keiichi>
"So, we're going to mess with them now?
 ...I don't care what kind of match it is, I'm going to win it!!"

<Rena>
"Oh, yes. ...Ehehe... I'll try, too!"

<Satoko>
"Heeey!!
 You're all very late!!
 It's unacceptable to keep a lady waiting, Keiichi-san~!!!"

<Keiichi>
"Ooh~ My bad.
 So, where is this lady I've kept waiting?"

<Satoko>
"Huwat did you just saAaaAay!?!?"
All right! Satoko was in top form as well. Seemed she was all excited about being able to get everybody in the club together for the first time in a while.

<Rena>
"...Wooa~☆... Rika-chan... Ky-K-K-K-K... Kyute...~♪!!"
Rena let out an elated sigh.
It seemed that the real Lady had made her appearance.

<Rika>
"...Good evening, everyone.
 Good evening to Keiichi, as well."

<Mion>
"Woo!!
 Looking good!
 You're looking sharp again this year!"

<Rena>
"K-Kyuutee...!
 Gonna take you home~!!"
Rika-chan was wearing a shrine maiden outfit.
 Yup.
 Rena's little outburst was completely understandable!

<Keiichi>
"Rika-chan's clothes sure look like the real deal...!!
 Is that a real shrine maiden outfit...?"

<Mion>
"My grandmother made them by hand.
 They're quite authentic."

<Rena>
"Rika-chan has an important role to play at the end of the festival, so she's wearing this."
I see. Rika-chan was on the executive committee because she performed all the shrine maiden rituals for the festival.

<Rika>
"...My work is only during the finale of the festival...
 so I can still play for a while."

<Satoko>
"So we cannot afford to waste any time~!
 Let us begin!!"

<Keiichi>
"Haoriiight!!"
It felt good to wander around the festival with just the five of us.
Mion called everyone over to a stand that caught her attention and proposed a rather odd competition.

<Mion>
"Takoyaki eating race~!!!
 Everyone has to buy their own.
 Ready? Go!!"
A standard in vendor stalls: the takoyaki stand!
What was especially standard for these kinds of events was the fact that they were simply balls of dough, takoyaki in name only!!

<Keiichi>
"It buUuUuUurns!!!"


<Rena>
"A-Are you okay, Keiichi-kun!?!?
 Have some water!"

<Satoko>
"My~ my~... Eating those scalding takoyaki whole is suicide!"

<Mion>
"I guess the trick is to buy the ready-made ones that have been left there for a while."

<Rika>
"...They really don't taste good."
The stall next to it was a shaved ice stand.
It was still a bit too early in the season for that, but right then it didn't matter!

<Keiichi>
"Let's do shaved ice this time!
 It's a shaved ice eating race!!
 Ready...
 Go!!!"

<Rena>
"...Sh-Shaved ice eating race... I... I can't!!"

<Satoko>
"As long as you can melt it a bit with your body heat, then...!!
 It's...?!
 It's so coOoOoold!!!"

<Mion>
"Not smart!
 This old man ordered it with plenty of syrup!!
 It'll melt quickly when it's mixed up!!"
Those stooges were too late!!
The moment they chose to tackle it head-on was their downfaaaAaaAll!!!

<Keiichi>
"Pheeew!!
 FiniIIiiIIshed!!!"


<Mion>
"K-Kei-chan is done!?
 Th-That was too fast...!!!!"

<Rena>
"It...
 It couldn't be...
 Keiichi-kun... you didn't... add water from the goldfish tank behind you, did you...!?"

<Rika>
"...That can't taste very good."
Next to that was another old favorite!
A cotton candy stand!!

<Satoko>
"Why don't we do this one next!?
 Of course, it's a speed eating conteeeest!!!"

<Rena>
"H-Hey, hey... How do you... eat cotton candy quickly?
 How!?"
On Satoko's mark, Mion, Satoko, and I all compressed the cotton candy with our bare hands!!
The time it took to stick the whole thing in our mouths? ...Three seconds!!!

<Mion>
"I expected Satoko to figure it out, but I didn't think Kei-chan would too...!!"

<Keiichi>
"I can't have you treating me like I'm a newbie forever, can I!?"

<Rika>
"...It won't taste very good."
Rika-chan had also crushed it between her hands and stuck it into her mouth.

<Rena>
"This is probably the only place in Japan where people eat cotton candy like this..."
I think only Rena's cotton candy was happy with how it was eaten...
But... it felt like we'd end up doing stuff like "eat noodles through the nose contest!" or "human water pump at the goldfish scoop!" at the rate things were going...

<Mion>
"This old man will probably still win, too!"

<Satoko>
"I am simply no match for Mion-san when it comes to eating repulsive things..."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, seriously."

<Mion>
"What's up with you guys?
 Are you telling me you don't want to have a Blue Hawaii-topped yakisoba-eating contest??"
Shake, shake! Both Satoko and I shook our heads in unison.

<Rena>
"U-Um...!
 Can we have a game that doesn't involve food this time? Can we?"
Rena's proposal was a godsend. It was about time we played a different kind of game.
It also seemed like neither Rena nor Rika-chan were any good at speed-eating or gorging themselves.

<Mion>
"Okay Rena. I'll let you pick out the next game!!
 Anything is fine!!"

<Rena>
"Well then, well then!
 I'm going to be the judge!
 Find kyute things on the festival grounds!!
 You have one minute~!!"

<Satoko>
"Fine by me!!
 I know exactly what Rena likes!!!!"

<Keiichi>
"All right...
 ...I think
 I can win with 'that'!!!"

<Rena>
"Ready... Go!!!
 ...Oh?
 Why aren't Keiichi-kun and Rika-chan starting? Why not?"
Mion and Satoko dashed off madly, but Rika-chan and I calmly stayed right where we were.

<Rena>
"C-Could it be... You've already found it?? The kyute thing!"

<Rika>
"...We've already found it. ...Keiichi, too?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah."

<Rena>
"What is it? What is it!? I can't wait!!"
Both Rika-chan and I stood motionless for those few moments before Mion and Satoko returned.

<Keiichi>
"This is probably the first time
......
 We've gone head-to-head like this."

<Rika>
"...It will be the first."

<Keiichi>
"Rika-chan... You expect to win with 'that,' huh?"

<Rika>
"...I am a member of this club as well.
 ...'Win by any means' is our society's third rule."
Rika-chan sneered to the best of her ability. ...You're on!!!
Both Mion and Satoko came back, each with their own plan of attack stuffed in their arms.

<Rena>
"Okay then, okay then, let's go in order!
 Let's start with the club president, Mii-chan!!"

<Mion>
"Too bad, you guys! I'm ending this now!!!
 This old man brought thiiiis!!"

Where did she get those?
...They were old diamond-shaped tin signs.

<Mion>
"...Pleb Curry... Snake coil incense... nostalgic tin signs from the old days!!!
 How about this!?!?"
That's very understated... A little too understated, Mion...
I used to see those stuck up on barbed wire fences.
They were more nostalgic than 'kyute'...
 ...Can you explain what part of that is 'kyute'?
But there were puffs of smoke noisily shooting out of Rena's ears and nose, almost like a steam train!!!!
I...
 I didn't get it...

<Satoko>
"I shall be up next!!!
 It is this!!!!"

...It was the hand-drawn poster from the ladies' society's roasted corn stall.
It was a really bad sketch done by a housewife.
...An anthropomorphic roasted corn drawn without any sort of real plan. Its very existence invited a sense of sorrow to the viewer.
...Bweep!!
That was the sound of blood jetting out of Rena's nose...!!
It seemed... to have been rated higher than Mion's!!
 ...I really didn't get it...
 It feels like your artistic sense is a little avant-garde by about... five eons...

<Satoko>
"Oh ho ho ho!!
 Those were nothing but mass-produced signs, after all!
 They had no chance against something hand-drawn!!"
I couldn't even begin to follow the way those guys were thinking...

<Rika>
"...Then I will be next."

<Mion>
"Next is Rika-chan, is it?
 What can you even do without anything!?"
Did you and Satoko both forget?
 ...If Rika-chan felt like it, she could simply...
After moving back about ten yards, she began waddling up to Rena.
...Seeing that, both Mion and Satoko gasped!!

<Satoko>
"O-O-O-O-Oh NoOoOo!!!"
Too late!!!!
Rika-chan tripped over nothing and lay motionless after falling down.
...Rena hurried over to her.

<Rena>
"R-Rika-chan, are you all right!? All right!?"
Rika-chan had a lump on her forehead and tears welled up in her eyes... Only her fingers peeked out from her sleeves...
 (This was the vital part!!) The palms of her hands were covered by her sleeves...!!
She made just a single sound--

<Rika>
 "...Meep."

<Rena>
"H-hau~~!!!!
 Ky-K-K-Kyute, kyute!!!
 Going to take you home~~!!!"

<Satoko>
"I'd completely forgotten thaaat!!
 The play that I personally had to use!!!"
Rena's face went completely red, her head bobbing back and forth with excitement. She embraced Rika-chan and began rubbing her cheek against her...!!!

<Keiichi>
"I'd expect no less from her...
 Not a single element was overlooked.
 She's tiny!
 Shrine maiden!
 Brink of crying!
 Meep!
 It was perfect!!
 A simple trip, transcended into pure moe...
 Now this is what you call art!!"

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan has a pretty weird definition of 'art.'"
I'll just pretend the sharp sting of those words cutting through me like a razor was a figment of my imagination.
Rika-chan turned her gaze to me with a daunting smile as she was caressed by Rena, who was in full 'Kyute Mode.'

<Rika>
"...Now, Keiichi. ...Can you beat me?"
...That cold smile is frightening, Rika-chan.
It must just be my imagination, but I see a demon inside her sometimes...

<Mion>
"Kei-chan seems to have his own plan of attack...
 ...I wonder what he's going to show her."

<Satoko>
"I also wish to observe the play Keiichi-san will make."

<Rika>
"...Could it be...? Is Keiichi also going to give a performance?"
I basked in their pointed stares...
I pulled Rena, who gave no sign of cancelling out of 'Kyute Mode,' away from Rika-chan.

<Rena>
"Hau~!!
 Kyute thing, kyute thing~...☆
 Keiichi-kuun... Let go...!"

<Keiichi>
"I'll show you something even cuter, so just hold on for now."

<Rena>
"Huh?
 Oh?
 S-Something even... kyuter??"

<Keiichi>
"But it's a bit too crowded here.
 Let's go back there."
Rena looked very surprised as I pulled her behind the shrine.

<Satoko>
"...I cannot fathom what Keiichi-san could possibly be planning."

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, wouldn't stoop to... no, would he?"

<Rika>
"...Keep on fighting!
 Yeah!"
After a bit, I returned.
...And a bit after that, so did Rena, dragging her feet.

<Mion>
"There's no way that scoundrel Kei-chan... did something... to innocent little Rena!?"
Mion and Satoko passed by me, heading straight to Rena.

<Satoko>
"W-What, exactly, did he do to you!?"
For a moment, Rena was too dazed to realize someone was talking to her.

<Rena>
"Gasp!?
 ...Hao, oh it's Mii-chan... hau..."

<Mion>
"Rena!
 A-Are you all right!? Did Kei-chan do anything to you!?"

<Rena>
"N... No... H-He... didn't do anything strange to me... hau..."

<Satoko>
"...This is quite severe...
 Exactly what did Keiichi-san show you!?"

<Rena>
"...Um... It was so kyute... hau~.☆"

<Mion>
"Kyute!? What did he show you, Rena!?"
Rena let out a really long "Hau~."
Her eyes sparkled as she spoke...

<Rena>
"Kyute, so kyute☆... It was Keiichi-kun's...
 furry little seal."
Whamp!
 WhoOoOmp!!!
In the blink of an eye Mion and Satoko's elbows smashed into my face...!

<Rena>
"Huh?
 Haoh!?
 What?
 What!?"

<Mion>
"...Sh-Showing Rena something so dirtyyyy~!!"

<Satoko>
"You sick pervert~!!!
 I shall have you beaten into oblivion!!!!"

<Keiichi>
"W-Wait, wait, you've got it all wrong!!!!!"
A dark, billowing aura flowed from Mion and Satoko!!
It was no good! Th-Th-They're gonna kill me!!!!

<Rena>
"Mii-chan!? I'm not sure what's going on... but you've got it all wrong!!
 You see, Keiichi-kun had...!!"

<Rika>
"...It's a fur seal keychain."
Rika-chan stuck her hand into my pocket and pulled out my keychain.

<Mion>
"Ehh?"

<Rika>
"...He said he made it long ago for one of his summer school assignments.
 He said he doesn't show it other often because it's embarrassing."

<Rena>
"Yeah...
 So small and kyute.
 ...He tried his best to make it. It's so wonderful...☆"

<Mion>
"Oh... Ohhh...!
 This old man thought you meant it was Keiichi's... Ahahaha.. haaa!!"

<Satoko>
"Oh ho ho ho!!
 I'd expect no less from Mion-san~!
 You misconstrue things in the wildest ways."
They slung insults at each other and looked like they were ready to tear into each other at any second!
...I beg of you.
...If I'm in the clear, would you mind getting off of me...?
We were interrupted by the flash of a camera.

<Tomitake>
"Hey, guys.
 You all seem energetic, as usual!"
It was Tomitake-san.
As I lay crumpled on the ground, Mion and Satoko continued to bicker above me.
Rika-chan was patting me on the head and Rena was still in Kyute Mode...
...It was probably quite a lively scene...

<Satoko>
"It's a fine evening, indeed! Although it's rather poor etiquette to photograph a lady without her permission!!"

<Keiichi>
"That's right.
 At least you don't really need Satoko's permission.
 Hurrngh!?!?"
Satoko dug her heel into me!!

<Rena>
"Good evening.
 ...Ah. You're heading back tomorrow,
 aren't you?
 Were you able to take lots of good photos?"

<Tomitake>
"Yes, thanks for asking.
 I got plenty of good shots."

<Mion>
"Tonight's the last we can see ol' Tomitake-sama, isn't it~!?
 It's such a shame.☆
 Hurry up and have your major breakout soon~!"

<Tomitake>
"J-Just as rude as ever, aren't you...!
 I really am sad I won't be able to hear that voice of yours for almost half a year."

<Mion>
"Be sure to have as much fun as you can tonight.
 You'll be back in Tokyo tomorrow, after all!"

<Tomitake>
"...That's true.
 It will be another six months...
 until I can enjoy another night where I can see the stars."
Tomitake-san looked up at the night sky cheerfully.
At that moment, even though he was smiling, I sensed a bit of sadness.

<Keiichi>
"Why don't you move here, Tomitake-san?
 In Hinamizawa."
Tomitake-san was speechless.

<Keiichi>
"It's not very convenient here.
 No shops.
 Or recreational spots... There might not be anything really here, but you know..."
Everyone knew what I was trying to say.
...Tomitake-san was also well aware.
So Rena, Mion,
 Satoko, and Rika-chan...
 none of them butted in.

<Keiichi>
"I've only been here for less than a month, so I don't really know everything about it."
Normally I'm a really talkative guy, but in situations like this I'm at a loss for words.
Even though all this was happening in such a boisterous setting,
 it felt like all the background noise was fading into the distance.

<Keiichi>
"This place is probably...!"
Tomitake-san rested his hand on me gently, silencing me.

<Tomitake>
"...Thank you.
 Keiichi-kun.
 Mion-chan and Rena-chan,
 Satoko-chan and Rika-chan."
Tomitake-san's smile was so slight it looked as if it was going to crumble at any minute, but it was warm.

<Tomitake>
"I also think it would be great... if I could live here."
Those might have been cruel words coming from a kid who didn't need to worry about working to feed himself.
A hand touched my back.
...It was Rena.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun. ...You shouldn't pick on adults. It's not nice."
The background clamor of the festival returned.

<Rena>
"We won't be seeing him for a while, after all!
 We need to make sure Tomitake-san also enjoys tonight!"
When Rena smiled, the mood instantly got brighter.

<Tomitake>
"That's true. I think I'll do just that."

<Rena>
"Ah!
 Hey, Mii-chan!!
 How about it!?
 Can we let Tomitake-san in on our club activities!?"
That's a great idea!!
 ...Or so I thought, but Mion had a snobbish look on her face.

<Mion>
"...One of the requirements for membership is residence in Hinamizawa, you see."

<Rena>
"Come on, Mii-chan... Just for today, don't be mean..."

<Mion>
"Well, he does come around often every year.  I'll make him an honorary citizen!!"

<Rena>
"Whoa!! Yaay!!!"

<Satoko>
"Now then!
 I wonder if this aged fellow, well past his prime, will be a match for me!"

<Rika>
"...Let's have him show us the wisdom of a mature adult."

<Keiichi>
"Heh heh! Can you keep up with us young 'uns?"
Tomitake-san stepped back slightly at our audacious grins.

<Mion>
"I, Mion Sonozaki, club president, do hereby authorize Honorary Citizen Tomitake's entry into our club!!"
Her words were quickly drowned out by our cheers.

<Tomitake>
"Wh-What do you mean by club...!?"

<Keiichi>
"What our club does, you see... In order to cope with our complicated society, we perform various activities with various rules. Sometimes they are in your favor...
 ...and sometimes they work against you...!!"

<Rena>
"...I'm pretty weak... so I'd prefer you not single me out. Let's try to get along."

<Satoko>
"If you wish to mock our childish games, then this will be the perfect opportunity!"

<Keiichi>
"We'll leave you with nothing!
 And beat you into the depths of hell!!"

<Rika>
"...So, it's a club where we play games together."
Of course Rika-chan was the only one to give an answer that made sense.

<Tomitake>
"All right! Just what I wanted.
 I'll take you up on that challenge!
 Don't be too rough on me, my mentors!"
Tomitake-san got riled up and did a victory pose like he was ten years younger!
That's perfect!!
We continued walking through the festival with Mion in the front. Now we looked like a family of six.
It had some intensity to it!

<Mion>
"Same rules as always! The loser will, of course, be subject to a penalty!!"
Tomitake-san was a bit surprised, but to us it was just the same as always.
...Regardless of how terrible a penalty it was,

<Rena>
"'Just don't lose!'"
Rena was also brimming with determination.
She didn't have any intention of losing.

<Keiichi>
"That's true!!"
I tousled Rena's hair to lighten the mood. She giggled to hide her embarrassment.

<Tomitake>
"I see... This is what it means to feel like a kid again."
Tomitake-san whispered that to nobody in particular.
At that moment, we heard an old man call out in a strong voice.
Looking over, I realized it was the man Mion had greeted right before the festival.

<Festival Stall>
"You're here.
 Little Miss Sonozaki! Seems you brought quite the crowd."

<Mion>
"We came to eradicate your entire stall!!"
His stall was a shooting gallery.
It was the usual setup where you had to knock down the prize you wanted with a cork gun.

<Mion>
"The rules are simple!!
 Three shots! The winner is whoever gets the biggest prize!!"
Everybody shouted their agreement.
There was no need to consider how to win, since the condition for victory was simply size.
The biggest prize at the stall... It went without question.
 It was that one, wasn't it...!?

<Rena>
"Whoa... Th... That teddy bear... K-Kyute...☆"
Rena was gazing longingly at a large stuffed animal.
It was intentionally placed on an unsteady platform, so it was possible to get it if you hit the right spot!

<Keiichi>
"...It's magnificently set up to make someone think that."

<Satoko>
"Not bad, Keiichi-san.
 I figured you would see through this scam instantly."

<Tomitake>
"Hmm. The most logical course of action would be to aim for some candy or a doll."
The intent analysis had already begun.
In this club, you'll get eaten alive if you don't come prepared.
Everything hinges on what plan you can come up with before the main event...!!!
At some point a large crowd had gathered around us, making a big fuss.
There was this much of a following for our club's infamous event!?

<Rika>
"...Knocking that bear down ensures a win."

<Keiichi>
"Only three shots.
 To use them all just trying... That'd be rough."

<Festival Stall>
"Hey!
 I have other customers waiting, you know!!
 Who's up first!?"

<Tomitake>
"The first one has the advantage of being able to aim for the easier prizes... but it's dangerous to compete without knowing the gun's quirks."
Tomitake-san's take on the situation was pretty good.
 He gets what our club is about...!

<Rena>
"Well then, to be fair... How about using rock-paper-scissors to decide? How about it!?"

<Mion>
"That's really the only way!
 Rock, paper, scissors!!!!"
After a couple of matches, it ended up with Mion being first.

<Mion>
"I didn't want to end up first... Ah well, I'll just think of it as a handicap. Gramps!! Gun!!"

<Festival Stall>
"Here yah go!!"
When the shooting range guy handed her a rifle, Mion looked it over intently.
She didn't forget to check the cork bullet, either.

<Mion>
"Okay.
 ...This gun is brand new, isn't it?
 No faults. Not bad!!"
Mion raised the gun in one swift motion!!
It was completely different from her careful inspection. She was shooting from the hip!!
Fire!
 Reload.
 ...Fire!
 Reload.
 ...Fire!!!
Flop.
...Flop, flop.
...Three candy boxes fell, one after the other.
A big haul!!
The crowd paused in a moment of awe and then erupted in cheers.

<Gallery>
"""Whoaaaaa!!!
 Awesooooome!!!!"""

<Satoko>
"Th... That was quite good...!!!"
Tomitake-san was at a loss for words after seeing such shooting prowess.

<Rena>
"A... Amazing, Mii-chan!!
 Three! Three!!!"
Her accuracy was incredible... Her choice of targets wasn't bad either.
The three Mion had gone after were fairly large and pretty easy to knock over. They were all targets with very high return on investment...!

<Mion>
"Who's up next?
 Satoko?
 ...Careful. The bullets are light."
Next was Satoko.
The rifle looked a bit big for her lithe body, but it didn't seem like she had any problem with the weight.

<Satoko>
"Of course
 ...
I shall aim for the grand prize!!"
She proclaimed that she was going after the teddy bear!
Damn Satoko! Such a bold move!

<Rena>
"The moment she knocks it over, she's guaranteed to be in first!"

<Rena>
"Good luck, Satoko-chan~!!"
Satoko was the opposite of Mion. She aimed at the target quite carefully... and squeezed the trigger!

<Satoko>
"...Bah. These bullets are too light...!"
The first two bullets struck the bear in the torso, but it only shifted a bit.
...You need to aim higher towards the head or it won't work...!
Satoko's third bullet wasn't aimed at the bear, but at the candy box below its arm.

<Satoko>
"I hate to say it, but it appears the bear is just too much for me...!"
She went boldly after the big catch, but since she switched over to less impressive prey at the last second, the crowd only gave a strained laugh.
Were they laughing because she lacked the courage?
...These fools know nothing!!

<Mion>
"A fine attempt, Satoko. You've gotten better!"
The palm of Mion's outstretched hand went "pomf!" as it tapped down lightly on Satoko.
She appeared to just be talking hot air, but this was actually completely calculated!
Damn that Satoko! Just to avoid being in last place, she dared to switch over to an easy target...!
Without shame or honor!!
 Magnificent...

<Satoko>
"I'll allow you to take the bear, Rena-san.
 I pray for your victory!"

<Rena>
"Okay, okay!
 Thanks so much, Satoko-chan.☆
 ...Hau~ Mr. Bear sho kyute!!"
Rena was up next.
She couldn't hit the broadside of a barn as regular Rena, but she said that bear was 'kyute'!

<Tomitake>
"I wonder how Rena-chan will do.
 ...I hope she's able to hit at least one."

<Keiichi>
"You're underestimating Rena, Tomitake-san...
 ...
 Heh."
It's Rena, you know?
It's Rena Ryuugu, you know!?
If it was to get that teddy bear...

<Gallery>
"""Whoaaaaah!!!"""
Tomitake-san wheeled around to see what all the commotion the spectators were making was about!
If it was to get that bear... she'd be able to shoot through a pinhole!
The one known as Rena Ryuugu could do it!!!!

<Rena>
"Sh-Sh-Shaking, it's shaking... hau... Kyute!!!"
Rena couldn't hide her excitement over the bear's slow rocking...! Now Rena couldn't lose!!

<Satoko>
"Not bad, Rena-san...!!
 The less collected you become..."

<Keiichi>
"The stronger you get!!!"

<Gallery>
"""Whooooaaa!!!!"""
Another big cheer!
Rena's bullet hit the bear's forehead again!!
 Not enough. The bear seemed to wobble more than before.

<Rika>
"...But it might not be possible."

<Tomitake>
"Y-You never know!
 With Rena-chan's skill, it might be...!!"
While Tomitake-san was just as excited as the crowd, Rika-chan's analysis was not swayed by emotion.
If Rena had ten more shots, then she could surely knock it over.
...
But... with just one more... No matter how you looked at it
...
 No go!

<Gallery>
"""OwWwwWw-----!!!!"""
The crowd let out a dejected groan...
She had shot it right in the forehead three times...
It was a bit late, but they gave her a good round of applause for the attempt.

<Rena>
"...Hau... Mr. Bear... take him home... hau..."
She should be praised for her valor, but she had no trophies to show for it.
...Then, at that moment, the old man flicked one of the candy boxes with his finger and handed it to Rena.

<Festival Stall>
"This's fer you, little lady."

<Rena>
"...Huh? ...You're giving this to...
 to me? Hau..."

<Festival Stall>
"The gods wouldn't forgive me if I let you go home empty-handed after such a display!"
There was another shower of applause!
Rena turned bright red and I pulled her back over to us by her hand.

<Keiichi>
"You did a good job!
 Your 'Kyute Mode' really surprised me!"

<Rena>
"...Hau... I really wanted Mr. Bear... Wah..."
It was easy to see that it only needed a little more to be knocked over.
Rena had done quite a lot for me.
 I still needed to pay her back for that delicious picnic.

<Keiichi>
"All right! Then I'll..."

<Tomitake>
 "I'll get it and give it to you."
Wuhaaaat!?!?
Tomitake-san had stolen the words right out of my mouth!

<Rena>
"Okay! Okay!
 Please, Tomitake-san!!
 Good luck~!!"
D-D-Damn you, old man Tomitakeee!!
 Stealing the good parts for yourself...!!
A small hand stretched over and fell gently on my head just before I was overcome with frustration.

<Rika>
"...You keep on fighting too, Keiichi,
 okay?"
Tomitake-san carefully studied the bear.
...Setting his sights, he shouldered the rifle while holding the other two shots in his hand.

<Keiichi>
"Hm!?
 Why is he doing that!?"

<Mion>
"...Yes, no doubt!!
 Tomitake-san is aiming for...!"
Pwop!
Pwop!
Pwop!!
 The time between shots was short!!
It was meaningless to shoot again once it stopped shaking!!
 So Tomitake-san  was relying on rapid fire to win the battle!!!
It was visibly wobbling much more than it ever had before...!
...But that was all...
 It still didn't fall over.

<Rena>
"Hau~~~... T-Too bad..."
All of Rena's momentary expectation from watching it sway violently turned into a dejected sigh.

<Tomitake>
"...Hmm~... I really thought it would work...!!"

<Satoko>
"Oh ho ho!
 It seems that, since you're a man, you will not be receiving any candy!"
That was it!
 It meant Tomitake-san had no spoils of war!

<Mion>
"So both Kei-chan and Rika-chan can just shoot down a sure, easy prize and avoid being dead last."

<Keiichi>
"Avoid being the loser, huh.
 ...
Oh, sorry about that."

<Tomitake>
"It's your turn next, Keiichi-kun. Best of luck!"
I was the fifth shooter.
I took the rifle from Tomitake-san.
If I took the ruthless route, as Mion had suggested, then I'd go for something insignificant.
 ...Except...!!
When I picked up the rifle, I definitely got a feeling from it.
 ...It was... burning passion!!
Passed down to me by Tomitake-san.
The regret of not being man enough to fell the bear that Rena wanted...!!
Yes, that's right.
 If I didn't aim for the bear
...
 Then I wouldn't be a man!!

<Keiichi>
"After all, that was my promise...
 to Rena."

<Rena>
"...Huh ...huh?
 ...What... promise? What?"

<Keiichi>
"To shoot down that bear.
 ...Then give it to Rena. That one."

<Rena>
"Uh... uh... You mean... hau..."
The crowd went wild when they saw our conversation!

<Gallery>
"""Whoooooo!!
 Cool, onii-chan!!
 Show us what you've got!!!!"""
Th-That's not it, fine men of the crowd!
...If I didn't do this... then Rena might mug the old man running the stall on his way home...!!
No! That's not it! That's not it at all!
Why can't I just express my honest feelings!?

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san surely talks the talk.
 ...But how do you actually intend to bring down the bear?"

<Rika>
"...Rena and Tomitake-san's shots did make it tilt a bit... but I think finishing the job will be difficult."

<Rena>
"...Keiichii-kun..."

<Keiichi>
"If only there was some way to shoot faster... I'd be able to pile more power on the sway from each hit...!"

<Rena>
"Good luck! Keiichi-kun!!
After taking two deep breaths, I shouted over to the guy.

<Keiichi>
"Two more rifles."
Huh!?
 The crowd murmured amongst themselves.

<Satoko>
"I wonder what Keiichi-san is up to...
 One person can't handle three rifles at once!!"

<Mion>
"I get it...
 Nice thinking, Kei-chan!!"
Mion was able to figure it out magnificently!

<Tomitake>
"Basically, what was taking the most time was reloading the shot."

<Rena>
"Th-That's right...!
 Then... by putting three pre-loaded rifles next to each other...!"
Tomitake-san went silent, peering at me and the bear through his lens.
His photographer's blood predicted a miracle will occur!
And then the crowd finally picked up on what I was planning!
They let out a great cheer!
 They chanted my name, Keiichi!!!
Rapid fire is the key!
 If I miss, all is for naught!!
...Phueeeeeew...
After letting out a deep breath... I paused.
 Relax...
NOW!
That moment... It felt like time itself had stopped.
I felt like I could see the trajectory of the bullets.
Hit it...
 and
...
 knock it down!
The first shot hit the bear on its head.
 The second...
 ...
 The third...
 !!!
The bear swayed hard!!
 And then...!

<Rena>
"Who-Whooooo!!
 Yeaaaaaah!!!!"

<Gallery>
"""oOOooOOOoOoOO!!!!"""
The cheers began before the stuffed animal even finished falling off the shelf.
The guy caught it before it hit the ground and tossed it over to me.

<Festival Stall>
"...You actually knocked it over.
 You got me!!"

<Tomitake>
"Amazing! Congratulations, Keiichi-kun!!"

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san has finally learned how to use his head!!
 I see you in a slightly better light now!!"

<Keiichi>
"I didn't do it all by myself. Everyone hit it, and those small bits together brought it down.
 ...This trophy belongs to all of us!!!"

<Mion>
"Right! This is from all of us working together~!!"

<Rika>
"...Mii didn't hit it a single time."

<Mion>
"...Urk."
After holding up the teddy bear like it was a championship trophy, I handed it to Rena.

<Keiichi>
"Here.
 This is from me... No, from everyone.
 Thanks for always making your delicious lunches."
Rena, thinking she was never actually going to get it, was momentarily speechless.

<Rena>
"I-I can't, Keiichi-kun... This is everyone's, after all... hau~."

<Keiichi>
"In that case, I was the one who knocked it down!
 And it's mine!
 It's mine, so I'm giving it to Rena!"
I pushed the stuffed animal towards her again.
 ...This time, she embraced and accepted it.

<Keiichi>
"You've watched out for me ever since I moved here, after all.
 I'm really grateful, you see...
 Thanks a lot!!"

<Rena>
"...H-Hau~~!!
 Keiichii-kuun!!
 Thanks so much~~☆!"
Rena dove at me.
Mion told me a few days later that Rena kissed me, but I didn't realize it during all the excitement at the time.
I remembered what I was trying to say to Tomitake-san earlier.
There really isn't much of anything here.
...But there are lots of things you can't find anywhere else.
I gained a lot from coming to Hinamizawa.
 ...Especially at that moment.
The crowd's cheers echoed on and on.
From the altar set up in front of the shrine, the drums sounded with a booming echo.
It was the finale of the festival.

<Rika>
"...I'll be going off ahead, then."

<Tomitake>
"Uh oh!
 I need to go and get myself a good spot, too.
 ...Well then everyone, see you in a bit."
Both Rika-chan and Tomitake-san gave their farewells and disappeared into the crowd.

<Satoko>
"I wish both of you the best in your endeavors~!!
 Now...
 Shall we be off?"

<Mion>
"Yeah, might as well go see Rika-chan's charming figure.
 Let's go!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah!
 Huh? Where's Rena?
 ...Wh-What are you doing??"

<Rena>
"K-K-Keiichi-ku~n!
 Mii-cha~n... Save me~...!"
Since she was carrying such a ridiculously large stuffed animal, she was being carried by the flow of people.

<Keiichi>
"What is she doing...
 She must have her hands full taking care of that bear..."

<Mion>
"So I'll leave Rena in your care, Kei-chan.
 I have my hands full taking care of Satoko."

<Satoko>
"Who would want to be looked after by you, Mion-san~!?
 Ouch! Please don't pull on my arm~...!"
Before losing sight of Mion, I grabbed the back of Rena's collar.

<Rena>
"K-K-Keiichi-kun... Not there... don't grab me there...!"

<Keiichi>
"Always so bossy.
 Where can I grab then?"

<Rena>
"...Uh... um... Hau..."
I didn't feel ashamed at all. Rena was ashamed enough for the both of us.
I grabbed onto Rena's hand and dashed after Mion and the others.

<Keiichi>
"We're gonna be late.
 Let's hurry up!"

<Rena>
"...Y-Yeah...!"
I hadn't realized Rena's hand was so delicate...
 ...Maybe she needed a bit more exercise and nutrition?
...That wasn't what I meant! Not at all!!
My ears burned.
I tried to keep calm. I repeated the phrase "Keep it together, Keiichi Maebara" in my mind, but it didn't look like I would be able to anytime soon.
I really didn't want Rena to see my face right then, so I pushed onwards, dragging her along without looking back even once.
There was already a huge group of people gathered at the altar in front of the shrine.
The fire at the altar made it as bright as midday and just as hot.
There was a pile of futons warded with sanctified rope in front of the altar.
Come to think of it, they did say it was a festival where they did something with the cotton in futons.

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san!
 Rena-san~!
 We're over here~!!"
Satoko waved her hand from the front row.

<Keiichi>
"Ah! Sorry, sorry!"
Making our way through the mass of people, we reached the spot they'd saved.

<Mion>
"How was it? Were you able to have a little bit of excitement with Rena~?"

<Keiichi>
"Y-Y-You punk! So that's what your plan was!?!?"
Instead of replying, Mion gave us a perverse grin.

<Mion>
"How was it, Rena?
 Was Kei-chan's hand bigger than you thought it would be~?"

<Rena>
"Ha... Ha
o~..."
Rena turned bright red, puffs of steam shooting out of her.
I heard something slice through the air and turned around to see Mion on the ground with a welt on her face.

<Keiichi>
"...Mion... When... were you hit...?"

<Mion>
"Between the 'ha' and 'o' of her hau~ I...
 think..."

<Keiichi>
"Rena...
 It's not good to punch your friends to hide your embarrassment..."

<Rena>
"I-I didn't hit her... W-Wh-whatever... hau."
Thump!! The thunderous beat of the drum echoed, silencing the crowd.

<Satoko>
"You must all be quiet!! It's beginning!!"
It was a solemn ritual.
Rika-chan entered dressed as a shrine maiden, followed by members of the municipal committee.
The elders all looked at Rika-chan and clasped their hands in praise.
The only thing allowed to disturb the profound silence was the flash from Tomitake-san's camera.

<Keiichi>
"What's the big thing Rika-chan is holding?"

<Rena>
"A hoe that's used for this festival.
 It's a sacred farming tool that only the shrine maiden may touch."
It was an awkward shape for a piece of farm equipment. Not uncommon for something used in rituals.
After reciting a Shinto prayer, Rika-chan approached the pile of futons gathered at the altar.
She swung the hoe skillfully, ploughing it into the futons.
Each and every little movement of this performance probably had to be done in a certain way...
Without a doubt, this was a ritual.

<Keiichi>
"What's next?
 Airing out futons?"

<Rena>
"She's purifying the futons, which sacrificially absorbed winter's illnesses for those using them."

<Mion>
"So when Kei-chan said 'airing out futons,' he wasn't completely wrong."
Rika-chan's face was already dripping with sweat.
...That hoe was probably really heavy.
She staggered side-to-side with the momentum of each swing.
Satoko looked on, silently lending her support...

<Keiichi>
"...Worried?"

<Satoko>
"Rika practiced every single day with a mochi hammer...
 ...She will certainly prevail."
Satoko's hands were sweaty, and whenever Rika-chan started to sway a little, she held her breath.

<Keiichi>
"...Why wasn't Mion a candidate to be the shrine maiden?
 ...It feels wrong, having Rika-chan swing around something so heavy."

<Mion>
"I'd do it if they asked me, you know...
 And well...
 it's not something just anyone could do."

<Keiichi>
"That's true.
 Shrine maidens need to be pure, after all.
 ...Ghrnk...!!"
Mion drove her elbow into my side!!
With the thud of the big drum, Rika-chan gave a solemn bow and descended from the altar.
...That triggered a round of generous applause.
After the Shinto priests had raised up the cleansed futons like a portable altar, all the spectators stood up.
 Following after the priests, we all marched on at a moderate pace.
They descended the shrine's giant stairs in a line.

<Keiichi>
"What's happening now?
 Washing the futons in the river?"

<Rena>
"Ahahaha.
 Watanagashi means setting cotton adrift, you know."
The procession continued right up to the bank of the stream.
A fire was stoked high and it was bright as day here, too.
People started crowding around it and clamoring.

<Rena>
"All right, get in line.
 Line up, Keiichi-kun."
...I wondered what was up.
Maybe we'd get some holy wine?
 Red and white bean buns?

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha...
 It's not food.
 I said it was
 cotton."
Ah, but of course.
 They didn't call it the Watanagashi for nothing.
 I finally understood.
The municipal committee members pulled out the cotton from inside the futons and balled it up like mochi, handing it out to people.
Rena dove into the line and brought out some for me as well.
We then proceeded to the bank of the stream.

<Rena>
"Since it's your first time, Keiichi-kun, just copy what I do."
She held the cotton in her right hand and, waving her hand as if to purify it, she touched it to her forehead, chest, navel, and both thighs.

<Rena>
"You do this three times, and silently give thanks to Oyashiro-sama."

<Keiichi>
"Oyashiro-sama? What's that? The name of the shrine's god?"

<Rena>
"Yes. It's the guardian deity of Hinamizawa.
 It brings about both miracles and curses!
 So you must be sure to show respect."
That sounded like a pretty frightening god.
 But, well, when in Rome...
I was officially a resident of Hinamizawa now, after all.
Doing as Rena showed me, I touched the cotton over myself three times.
Thank you, Oyashiro-sama... Thank you, Oyashiro-sama... Oyashiro-sama...

<Rena>
"This way, all the evil that possesses you is sucked out by the cotton.
 ...Then you let it gently drift away on the stream, and you're done."
Together, Rena and I set our pieces of cotton afloat on the surface of the water.
The flowers of cotton blooming in the water had sucked out all the bad illnesses from Hinamizawa and drifted off, disappearing into the distance.
It was wonderful, like those floating lantern festivals I'd seen on TV. The best part, though, was feeling like this rite of passage had made me a true resident of Hinamizawa.



[Onikakushi Ch.7]

While staring off into the stream, I somehow got separated from Rena.
I wasn't very lonely though.
I know this place now.
 ...This is where I live. My home.
It's probably better if I just stay here instead of wandering around aimlessly.
Someone would surely find me while I was enjoying the evening breeze.
...I heard a familiar voice.
 It was Tomitake-san's.
I headed towards it.

<Keiichi>
"How did it go, Tomitake-san? Were you able to get some good shots?"

<Tomitake>
"Yeah. Fortunately!"
Tomitake-san was with a girl.
 ...I felt a little like I was intruding.

<Woman>
"How was it, Keiichi-kun?
 Did you enjoy the festival?"
From the way she spoke, it seemed like she was a resident of Hinamizawa.
...I really should try harder to remember people's faces here.
What was her name...?

<Keiichi>
"Well... umm... It was fun."
My face must have given away how desperately I was trying to remember her name, because she gave a lighthearted chuckle.

<Tomitake>
"It's probably because it hasn't been long since you moved here.
 It's pretty hard to believe, seeing how friendly you've gotten with the other kids."
If that's how it looked, it was probably all thanks to Rena and Mion.

<Woman>
"Perhaps you feel more like a resident of Hinamizawa after taking part in the festival today...?"

<Keiichi>
"...Hmm...
 I wonder about that."

<Tomitake>
"Oh, that's not like you."
I had tried to get used to Hinamizawa.
But... there were still plenty of things I didn't know.
The faces of people I'd met, for example.
 ...Things that had happened in the past, as well.

<Tomitake>
"...Oh.
 You're feeling left out because of something like that?"

<Keiichi>
"It's not so much as feeling left out...
 It's just... I'm not sure how to say it..."
That incident at the dam construction site.
 The fighting over it and other conflicts.
...That terrible incident they pretended they didn't even know about whenever I brought it up.
Even though it was in the past... As someone living in Hinamizawa, it wasn't wrong to want to know about both the good and bad that had happened here.

<Tomitake>
"If it will put you at ease, then I'll tell you everything I know."
Tomitake-san's smile made me more relieved than I'd ever been.
It was hard to think of what to ask when someone said "ask me anything," though.
...Even when there was so much I wanted to ask.

<Keiichi>
"Then... could you tell me about what happened when the dam was being constructed?
 There was a big incident where Hinamizawa was going to be submerged, right...?"

<Tomitake>
"I think the locals would be more knowledgeable about the dam than I am.
 Well, if you don't mind, I'll tell you what I know.
 ...It's only what I read in the newspaper though."
Tomitake-san's eyes entered an unfocused gaze as he searched through his memory. Then he spoke.

<Tomitake>
"The decision to start the dam project was finalized seven or eight years ago.
 I heard it was the next largest project after the one in Kurobe."
There were three major issues in Japan at that time.
Improving inter-island transportation infrastructure, meeting the higher demand for electricity,
 and flood control.
There was a boom of dam building due to the massive economic stimulus they provided on top of generating electricity and flood control.
Hinamizawa had the right conditions to support dam construction, so it was singled out.

<Tomitake>
"The dam reservoir would have covered quite a lot of ground when it was completed.
 The entire area, right up to Yagouchi way upstream, would be underwater."

<Keiichi>
"...But... why did they have to pick a populated area like Hinamizawa?
 Couldn't they have instead picked a place where nobody lived?"

<Tomitake>
"Hmm~... I'm not really sure why, but I heard that it was just the right terrain for building a dam."
Of course, there were protests here in Hinamizawa.
Rika-chan had said that they had 'fought.' From that choice of words I had to guess things had turned violent.

<Tomitake>
"There was a trial and it was even brought up before the National Diet.
 It was covered in the Tokyo newspapers, too."
Mion had told me all about that, as well.
I'm sure every resident of Hinamizawa had united to fight together.
...The feeling of solidarity found here, which could not be expressed properly with mere words, was likely brought about by that battle.

<Tomitake>
"As a result, bribery and scandals were brought to light.
 As things got more and more complicated, they eventually halted construction."
If I wanted to know, now was my only chance to ask.
It was certainly a bizarre incident that boys my age would be curious about.
I felt a little shame from the fact I was petty enough to have my curiosity piqued by Rena and Mion's refusal to talk about the event...
But I figured I might as well ask since I had the chance...
 Just so I would stop thinking about it so much.

<Keiichi>
"So... there was a dismemberment... right?"

<Tomitake>
"There was.
 I happened to be here in Hinamizawa at the time,
 so I remember it well."
Tomitake-san's answer was nonchalant in contrast to my hesitantly forced-out question.

<Tomitake>
"...It was about this time, four years ago.
 It was the day of the Watanagashi, if I recall correctly."
Debate on whether to continue construction on the dam was in disarray. Scandal after scandal rocked the project near the end.
...The incident that was the final nail in the coffin for the dam project.
A fight at the dam construction site ended in the victim being murdered.
Fearing prosecution, the six assailants divided the remains into six pieces and each hid one.
Five of the six criminals turned themselves in out of guilt, but one was still on the run.
The right arm he'd hidden had yet to be found.
The major details lined up with what was in the tabloid I'd read earlier.
It certainly was a tragic incident... but it wasn't so terrible that Rena and Mion needed to hide it from me.
I guess they didn't want someone who'd just moved here to have a negative impression of Hinamizawa.
I felt grateful for having friends who worried so much about me, as well as shame for still being so interested in it.

<Tomitake>
"It was near the end of all the trouble with the dam, you see.
 So everyone was saying that it was Oyashiro-sama's curse."

<Keiichi>
"Oyashiro-sama's curse, huh..."
Oyashiro-sama was the name of the god at the shrine that held the festival today, if I recalled correctly.
I see.
Their guardian deity rained divine punishment down on the evil dam construction for trying to flood Hinamizawa.

<Woman>
"Apparently the younger ones didn't think so...
 But it seems the elderly in the village never doubted that it was Oyashiro-sama's curse."
The woman with Tomitake-san chuckled mischievously.
Tomitake-san began laughing with her. It was so infectious I ended up laughing as well.

<Woman>
"...But... I wonder about now.
 There are quite a few, I think.
 Amongst the youth, too."

<Keiichi>
"A few... what?"

<Tomitake>
"People who believe...
 in Oyashiro-sama's curse."
The woman's lips were still curled into a smile, but her expression turned stern.

<Tomitake>
"Then after that...
 it continued every year.
 ...Always around this time."

<Keiichi>
"Continued? What continued?"
Tomitake-san paused for a second as if to build up some suspense. Then he whispered to me, as if someone might have been listening.

<Tomitake>
"Every year... on the day of the Watanagashi...
 ...Somebody dies."


<Tomitake>
"The year following the dismemberment, on the day of the Watanagashi...

<Tomitake>
A man from Hinamizawa who had supported the dam fell off a cliff overlooking some rapids and died, while he was on vacation.
 Speaking of his wife, unfortunately, her body was also never recovered."

<Woman>
"He supported the dam construction even though he lived in Hinamizawa.
 At the time, there were whispers amongst the elderly saying it was Oyashiro-sama's curse."
The woman chuckled mischievously again.

<Keiichi>
"The shrine's Shinto priest... You mean he was from the shrine here?"
The woman nodded.

<Woman>
"There was a rumor amongst the villagers that they weren't able to quell Oyashiro-sama's anger."

<Tomitake>
"Then the year after that, again on the night of the Watanagashi...
 they discovered the battered body of a local housewife."
...Housewife?
Up until now, all these mysterious deaths were people involved with the dam or who had connections with Oyashiro-sama.
With that in mind, could the housewife have been involved in some way, too?

<Woman>
"Exactly."
The woman stated slyly.
 ...No, it was more menacingly.

<Woman>
"The victim's family, you see...
 happened to be that of the younger brother of the dam supporter who fell to his death two years before."

<Tomitake>
"The younger brother is still alive, it seems,
 but it did bother him quite a bit. So he moved to the neighboring town."
...For a while, I stood there with my mouth agape.
The battle over the dam construction, with Hinamizawa's future at stake,
and the murder at the center of it all.
That was all I knew, and that was all I wanted to ask about.
But that wasn't all there was to the story.
Homicide.
 Body disposal.
 Accidental deaths.
 Terminal illness.
 Suicide.
 Fatal beatings.
I'm a pretty level-headed person...
I don't really want to believe in curses...
But... the freakish deaths happened every year, on the day of the Watanagashi, and all of them were related to the dam construction...!?
It was easy to dismiss each of them as coincidences by themselves.
But when you put them all together...
 Dismissing all of them as coincidence would then defy logic.
I don't believe in curses.
 But... Every single year, on the day of the Watanagashi, somebody or something 'makes' it happen...
 Without fail...
The woman chuckled again, as if she picked up on what I was thinking.
It felt like she was saying, "Maybe there was. Maybe we frightened him." Stuff like that.
I felt embarrassed at being read so easily. I pressed Tomitake-san to continue, a bit of impatience and irritation in my tone.

<Keiichi>
"Then?
 So someone died the next year, right...?
 Who was it that time?"

<Tomitake>
"I wonder...
 ...
 Who do you think, Keiichi-kun?"

<Keiichi>
"Th... The hell!?"
The way he said it didn't agree with me. The sarcastic tone ticked me off.

<Keiichi>
"Don't avoid the question...! I'm serious here...!"

<Woman>
"Hey, hey. Calm down, Keiichi-kun."
I realized when she tried to calm me down that I had been panicking.

<Tomitake>
"We aren't trying to avoid the question, Keiichi-kun.
 It's just... When you say 'the next year,' that's..."

<Woman>
"That's today."

When Tomitake-san hesitated to say it, she finished for him.
...I broke into a cold sweat. I really didn't like the direction this was headed.

<Woman>
"Nobody wants to speak of it, but they all think it's going to happen again tonight."

<Keiichi>
"Th-The festival was so cheerful, though!!"

<Woman>
"Well, the victim last year, the housewife... She was a non-believer.
 It turns out she didn't even attend the Watanagashi festival."

<Tomitake>
"There was a rumor going around that if you didn't participate in the festival, you would incur Oyashiro-sama's wrath.
 ...Didn't you hear anything about this, Keiichi-kun?"
I never even heard a whisper of that rumor.

<Keiichi>
"...Th-Then the reason everyone was at the festival was... they were afraid of the curse!?"

<Tomitake>
"I figured that must have been the reason...
 ...There were a lot more people at the Watanagashi than usual."

<Woman>
"I guess everyone was... just afraid after all.
 Of Oyashiro-sama's curse."

<Keiichi>
"...."
I couldn't utter a single word...
In this modern age.
Where we've made progress in all scientific fields, shedding light on the unknown and misunderstood.
Where black and white television has been eradicated and we've sent men to the moon.
Even with all of our accomplishments...
 This can exist in modern society?

<Woman>
"Tons of invitations were sent out to neighboring towns' youth groups to help pad the numbers.
 But after that string of events, few decided to join.

<Woman>
The municipal committee members were complaining about how hard it was to gather participants."

<Tomitake>
"Also, the police are treating each case as isolated; they don't believe they're connected.
 ...But apparently they sent quite a few plainclothes officers for security."
It finally began to dawn on me why Rena and Mion were reluctant to talk.
If nothing happened during this Watanagashi, everything would have been over with and I'd be none the wiser.
...If nothing happened, all would be well.
 In that case, it would all end up being just crazy talk.
I should have just pretended like I knew nothing from the beginning.
 Then they wouldn't have had to act like nothing happened.
...And we would have all gotten back to life as usual.

<Woman>
"...Maybe it was just too much for him, after all."
The woman ran her fingers through her hair as she sighed.

<Keiichi>
"N-No... It wasn't,
 not at all..."
I had tried to act strong, but that just served to emphasize how much the information had unsettled me.
After seeing how I looked, Tomitake-san appeared to regret saying anything.
Letting out a sigh, he then spoke, forcing an awkward, upbeat demeanor.

<Tomitake>
"Keiichi-kun, surely you don't believe in such things as curses."

<Keiichi>
"...Well... no..."

<Tomitake>
"If the causes of all of the crimes were unknown, with the perpetrators and their methods all mysteries, then I'd concede the possibility of a curse.

<Tomitake>
But that's not how things are in reality.
 Police investigations have already uncovered the truth and perpetrators for all of the cases."
Hearing him say "police" made me feel a lot better.
It was perfect for repelling the word "curse."

<Tomitake>
"...The first one, the dismemberment, for example.
 I told you, didn't I?
 All but one of the perpetrators were arrested.
 It's only a matter of time for the last one.

<Tomitake>
 The motive turned out to have been an argument they had while intoxicated. 
That's no curse.
 ...Don't you agree?"
That was true. If it didn't happen on the day of the Watanagashi, then I wouldn't think it was related to the curse at all...

<Tomitake>
"The accidental deaths of the couple who supported the dam is the same.
 He was in a position that made others hate him. The police made a point of investigating from that angle.
 They concluded it was an accident. 

<Tomitake>
Not foul play."

<Keiichi>
"But they both happened on the day of the festival, right...?"

<Tomitake>
"Ha ha ha.
 Just think about it, Keiichi-kun.
 Do you think people with a lot of enemies here in Hinamizawa could participate easily in a local festival?

<Tomitake>
It would be especially hard for them to be around during the Watanagashi.

<Tomitake>
So they probably left Hinamizawa intentionally around this time of year to travel, don't you think?"
It wasn't a very clear explanation, but I sort of understood what Tomitake-san was getting at.
So I pressed on earnestly, asking more questions so that I could convince myself.

<Keiichi>
"Then, Tomitake-san, what about the priest who died after that?
 The one with the unknown illness.
 ...That also happened on the day of the festival."

<Tomitake>
"It's even easier to explain what happened to the Shinto priest.
 The Watanagashi is a really big event that happens once a year. It was probably from all the built-up stress. 

<Tomitake>
Or it may have been because of a pre-existing condition."

<Keiichi>
"But it was an unknown illness.
 It's hard to believe such a thing could exist with all our advances in medicine..."

<Tomitake>
"It's just an exaggeration.
 Rumors making rumors.

<Tomitake>
Anyone would get worked up over having incidents happen two years in a row.
 The sudden death is quite unnatural, though...

<Tomitake>
Of course, the police ordered an autopsy because of the strange way he died.
 ...But there wasn't enough for them to open a full investigation, you know?
 Turns out it was just a sudden death due to illness."

<Keiichi>
"...The priest's wife committed suicide, correct?
 What about that?"

<Tomitake>
"I believe I already explained that.
 Everyone was shaken up by the incidents happening for a third year.
 Those who are of strong faith were quick to believe it was the work of the curse. 

<Tomitake>
...Of course, that included the priest's wife.

<Tomitake>
Apparently they found a suicide note that said something like:
 ...
 'My death will quell Oyashiro-sama's anger.'"

<Keiichi>
"Well, then, how about... the next incident, with the housewife?
 That happened on the day of the Watanagashi too!"

<Tomitake>
"The perpetrator has already been caught and the case has been closed.
 Turns out it was just some nutjob trying to continue the legacy of the Hinamizawa curse."

<Keiichi>
"Then... Then...! ...How about the incident the next year!?
 ...Oh, uh..."
Oh, yeah. This year is the next year.
Tomitake-san gave a hearty laugh.

<Tomitake>
"Nothing will happen.
 Not this year.
 ...There was never a curse to begin with.
 It's just that a group of people believed it was the explanation for a string of coincidences."
...My internal computer finally got itself back on track.
I felt a bit embarrassed by how childish I'd become after losing control and panicking.

<Tomitake>
"I can see very clearly now that Keiichi-kun really does love Hinamizawa.
 Even if Oyashiro-sama's curse actually did exist,
 I can't imagine that Keiichi-kun would become a target."
I felt very relieved.
I should probably just forget everything I heard tonight.
I'll greet Rena and Mion tomorrow with the same smile as always.
They'd probably also like tonight to end without incident, so they can continue on tomorrow without having worried me.
Perhaps seeing my change in attitude, the woman who had been listening in stretched as she got up from the rock she was sitting on.

<Woman>
"...Well, then.
 I should be getting back."

<Tomitake>
"Goodness! I think I may have gone on a bit too long!"
There were so few people compared to the crowd from before. I could only make out a few groups of families enjoying the cool evening air.
I looked at my watch; it seemed we'd talked for the better part of an hour.

<Woman>
"Didn't you come along with your friends, Keiichi-kun?
 Not going to look for them?"

<Keiichi>
"...Oh, yeah...!
 They might all be looking for me!"

<Tomitake>
"Heheheheh!
 You're quite the scoundrel, making the girls look for you."

<Woman>
"See you, Keiichi-kun. Have a nice night.
 ...You too, Jirou-san. I'll see you a bit later."
...Tomitake-san seems to be quite the scoundrel himself. (So his name is Jirou...)
After dusting off her backside, she disappeared into the crowd of people still busy cleaning up the shrine grounds.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun~!!
 So sorry~!!"
In her place, Rena came running over.
I could see all the others behind her.
Speak of the devil.

<Mion>
"My bad, Kei-chan...!
 We got so caught up in our discussion!"
I'd completely forgotten about them while caught up in my own conversation, so we were even.

<Satoko>
"My, so Tomitake-san was with you!
 This works out perfectly!!"

<Rika>
"We still need to settle the shooting gallery competition."

<Tomitake>
"Ah, th-that's right...!
 So I guess I'm gonna end up dead last?"
In the end, after my dramatic victory, Rika-chan was the last challenger. But there weren't many targets left.
The ones remaining were all tiny and difficult to hit.
She did take her time and aim, but all three shots completely missed. She was to end up sharing the loser's crown with Tomitake-san.
...However, she did her little meeping cry in front of the owner, and he turned to mush instantly.
She was given a pack of gum as a consolation prize.
Her methods were a bit audacious, but she did avoid being the loser rather magnificently.

<Keiichi>
"...Come to think of it, Rika-chan is quite the trickster."

<Rika>
"I have no idea what Keiichi is talking about."

<Mion>
"Now then! It's decided that Tomitake-san is dead last~!!!"
Everyone cheered and applauded. Tomitake-san smiled wryly, slightly bewildered.

<Mion>
"So~ Tomitake-san, are you ready? Penalty time!!"

<Tomitake>
"Huh? Oh, I completely forgot about that!!"
You're too naive, Tomitake-san. This is why you've got to avoid losing in our club...
Mion pulled a felt-tip marker from her pocket.
 ...Oh, it's that.

<Keiichi>
"Show him some mercy, Mion.
 At lease use a washable marker.
 A permanent one is too harsh."

<Mion>
"Ahaha, it just has to be permanent.
 Water-based marker would come off in the laundry."

<Tomitake>
"Whoa, whoa! What is this!?
 Please take it easy on me!!"
All of us pinned his arms behind his back and Mion approached him with the marker in one hand.

<Mion>
"Aaand squip, squip, squip!"
But she didn't write on Tomitake-san's face... She wrote on the shirt he was wearing.
"You'd better have your big break this year! -Mion"
Rena took up the marker next. "Show me your photos next time, okay?☆ -Rena"
It was a little heartwarming, and I just had to laugh.

<Tomitake>
"Haha, this is more like a farewell card than a penalty."

<Satoko>
"Ho ho ho! I'm not as soft as the rest!
 I'll make sure this is a proper penalty!"
"Haha~ dead last! -Satoko"
"Try harder next time. -Rika"

<Satoko>
"Here you go, Keiichi-san."
I couldn't decide what to write, but based on what kind of penalty this was... this was probably the most appropriate.
"Come back and play again. -Keiichi"
Tomitake-san was silent the entire time.
At first he was quite bewildered, but now he had a different look on his face.

<Tomitake>
"So I have to wear this all the way back to Tokyo as part of the penalty?"

<Mion>
"Of course! You'd better wear it all the way home~!"

<Rena>
"Ahahaha, you could wear it when you come back.
 It would be nice!"
He appeared deeply moved.
Embarrassment mixed with a wealth of other emotions made him turn a bright red.

<Tomitake>
"Understood. I'll wear this the next time I come here.
 I promise!"
Everyone cheered and applauded.
It was the finest parting gift possible for a buddy heading out tonight.
I saw the woman who was with Tomitake-san standing near the festival grounds.
It seemed Tomitake-san noticed her too, and knew it was time to leave.

<Mion>
"Seems like your guest is waiting~!
 Isn't it about time?
 Hmm~?"

<Tomitake>
"Yeah,
 that's certainly how it seems... haha."
Tomitake-san headed off towards her and seemed to apologize for making her wait.
We all shouted stuff at Tomitake-san.
Each time we did, he looked back and waved his hand.
...Eventually, he faded into the darkness of the night, out of sight.
It was quite the casual farewell.
This wasn't the first time any of us had seen someone off.
They had done the same thing many times before.

<Rena>
"...He's gone."

<Mion>
"Well, it's about time we take off too!"
Rika-chan had to stay behind with the other committee members, since they were having a meeting. Satoko was tagging along with her.
I headed back home with the usual suspects.
The walk back was quite lively, with talk of the day's war stories.
Should have done this, should have done that, that kind of stuff.
Rena and I parted ways with Mion, and then it was just the two of us.
Then we got to my house and I parted ways with Rena as well.

<Keiichi>
"It's already pretty late. Are you alright by yourself?"

<Rena>
"Yeah, I'm perfectly fine!
 It's close. I'm going to run, too."

<Keiichi>
"...If you run into some weirdo, just yell."

<Rena>
"If I do shout... will you come and save me, maybe? ...Maybe?"

<Keiichi>
"If I hear you."

<Rena>
"Hau...!
 ...O-Okay!
 I'll scream loud enough so you can hear me!"
Merrily spinning her arms around at high speed, Rena dashed off.
She was fine. In that mode, not even an adult could stand against her.
Rena's cheerful presence disappeared and it finally became quiet again.
The curse that not a soul mentioned, even under their breath.
 ...The more I learned about it tonight, the more unsettling it became.
It didn't show on any of their faces, but they were probably all quite concerned about it as well...
But if nothing happens tonight, then it all ends up being just crazy talk.
Nothing will happen. Nothing bad, nothing at all.

<Keiichi's mom>
"What's wrong, Keiichi? Why are you standing in a place like that?
 Come inside. You'll catch a cold."
It was my mom.

<Keiichi>
"Did you go, Mom?
 To the Watanagashi festival?"

<Keiichi's mom>
"In the end your father didn't wake up,
 so I missed it.
 A little disappointing."
Mom stuck her tongue out with a bit of an embarrassed look on her face.



[Onikakushi Ch.8]


<Mion>
"Good morning~!
 Nice job yesterday, Kei-chan!"

<Keiichi>
"You didn't do so badly yourself, Mion!
 Yesterday was fun!"

<Rena>
"Oh, that's right. Keiichi-kun, thank you very much!
 For Mr. Bear!"

<Keiichi>
"I'm glad you like it. Don't use it as a pin cushion, though."

<Rena>
"I-I wouldn't...!"
Still chatting happily, we entered the classroom. But the moment I stepped into the room...
 a splashing sound and a nasty sensation.
It was a bucket filled to the brim with water.
And unfortunately, my foot stepped right into it.

<Satoko>
"My, now. How diligent of you to mop the floor this morning~!"
*clomp clomp clomp*
 *fwip*
 *bwif*

<Satoko>
"B-Bwaaaaahh!!
 Keiichi-san flicked my forehead~!!"

<Rika>
"You should set a more brutal trap next time."
Seeing that, Rena began to swoon as Mion looked on in disbelief.
Everything was the same as always.
Everybody was there and nothing felt out of place.
The uncertainties I'd had in the back of my mind since yesterday had vanished.

<Rena>
"What is it, Keiichi-kun?
 Didn't get enough sleep, maybe?
 Maybe?"

<Keiichi>
"I slept like a log. But if you want, I'll do a reenactment during class."

<Rena>
"You shouldn't do that...!"
Mion alerted us that the teacher was coming, so everyone shuffled off to their seats.

<Chie>
"Good morning, everyone.
 So yesterday was the festival.
 Thank you to all the people who stayed until the very end to help clean up."
We were all slackers, so none of us actually helped clean up.
...Actually, I had a feeling that the only thing we did was run around the festival and cause a ruckus...

<Chie>
"Okay then. This time of year, you might see some people here from out of town doing interviews about the festival for magazines."
I thought it was the usual stuff so I was going to tune it out, but then I noticed the different tone in her voice and started paying attention.

<Chie>
"You may be asked questions. Please don't say anything silly or something that could be taken the wrong way.
 ...Do you understand?"
In unison, everyone replied, "Yes, ma'~~am!"
What she'd said was really vague, but I understood what she was trying to say.
After all, this was the fifth year.
There were probably lots of third-rate reporters pouring in, hoping something regarding the curse had happened.
It did nothing but perpetuate the village's bad image.
She was saying, "Don't spout stupid shit you think is funny."
And now, I was one of ones who needed to keep their mouths shut.
I found it rather cute how I felt a sense of unity from such a trite thing, if I do say so myself.
I was summoned to club activities after school.
Since everybody was still pretty tired from yesterday, we just spent the day relaxing pea— Yeah, that wasn't happening!

<Mion>
"Today, let's play a classic game of deduction!
 How about this one!?"

<Keiichi>
"Oh! A game from overseas!
 Looks interesting!"

<Satoko>
"The instructions are in English.
 ...But the rules don't seem that hard!"

<Rena>
"...I-I won't lose, you hear."

<Rika>
"I'm not too bad at this game."
It seemed that Rena didn't handle this kind of game very well.

<Mion>
"The rules are... The person who can match the murderer, weapon, and the scene of the crime wins!"
There were three kinds of cards comprised of suspects, weapons, and locations.
I could see that the names "Mion" and "Rika" were written on the suspect cards.
 Oh~ A card with my name on it as well!

<Keiichi>
"There are plenty of different weapons, too!
 Like knives, axes, and poison!
 The locations are pretty nice too!
 Like the living room, the study, and the courtyard!"

<Mion>
"So basically...
 You take out one of each of the cards.
 These are the answer cards."

<Mion>
"So we shuffle the remaining cards and hand them out.
 We ask each other about the cards and figure out the right ones!"
Ahhh, I see. So the cards nobody has are the true perpetrators.

<Mion>
"Then you raise your hand if you know the answer!
 The game ends and we check if the answer is correct."

<Mion>
"If you're right, then you get a point!
 If you're wrong, then you lose a point!
 Since the game ends even if no one gets it right, all the cards are gathered up and redistributed!"

<Satoko>
"You'll learn as you go!
 You really have to use your brain!"

<Rika>
"You'll get confused if you don't take notes."

<Keiichi>
"The rest you can figure out by playing... So, Mion!
 What's the penalty this time!?"
Everyone directed their attention to Mion!

<Mion>
"Let's see...
 We're all still a little tired from yesterday, so maybe we'll take it easy with a gofer penalty?
 You'll be asked to rush out and buy stuff for everyone!"

<Rena>
"So just being asked to go buy stuff like drinks and candy, I guess."

<Rika>
"...I feel like the penalty today is pretty simple."
...I wonder... Is it really?

<Satoko>
"Is Keiichi-san thinking what I'm thinking?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah...
 You don't know what you'll have to go buy."
I'm betting Mion would send out whoever loses to buy stuff like "hemorrhoid cream" or "Happy family planning manual" or other crazy stuff!!
The cards were lightly shuffled and passed out to each player.
The real perpetrator, the correct weapon, and the scene of the murder have been taken out, so that means all the cards I have in my hand are 'innocent' cards.

<Mion>
"Then~ I'll go first since I'm the club president, I guess...
 Well, then...
 'Mion,'
 'Knife,'
 'Study'!"
You pick one suspect, weapon, and murder scene and ask the other players.
If you have any of those cards, then you must say "I have one." However, you don't need to say which one you have.

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, I got it."

<Rena>
"Me too."

<Rika>
"...I have one."

<Satoko>
"Oh my, all of them are here."
Three people answered when she asked if they had "Mion," "Knife," and "Study."
So that means that "Mion" and "Knife" and "Study" are all in the clear. Got to jot that down...

<Rena>
"Then I'll go...
 'Rena,'
 'Axe,'
 'Lounge'!"
Hrm, only two people said they had one?
 So it means... out of "Rena," "Axe," and "Lounge," one of them is correct and is part of the crime!?
No, wait. Even if they say they have one, they don't have to say how many!
It's possible that either Satoko or Rika-chan has two of the cards...!!

<Mion>
"Well, Kei-chan is next. Go ahead!"

<Keiichi>
"W-Wa-wait just a little...!
 I'm still sorting things out!"
...The game has me thinking more than I thought...!
 Oh, man, this feels like it's going to be tough!!

<Mion>
"All right! Now I have the criminal!!"

<Keiichi>
"What!?
 Already!?"
Here I am spinning around in circles, and Mion just now raises her hand.

<Mion>
"The murderer is 'Rika-chan'...
 ...in the 'Infirmary,' with the 'Poison'!
 Well!?"
Mion drew the cards from the box and we checked to see if her deduction was right...

<Mion>
"I was right!!"

<Satoko>
"Errh~! All I needed was one more hand~!
 I couldn't tell whether it was 'Poison' or a 'Pistol'~!!"

<Rika>
"I'd never use a pistol.
 I like killing them slowly with poison."
Rika-chan said such a hugely terrifying thing with such a sweet little face.
Everyone was making a commotion about how they almost had it.
 Rena and I were left out in the cold, though.

<Rena>
"...How did you do, Keiichi-kun...?
 I couldn't get it at all..."

<Keiichi>
"Don't worry.
 I had no idea either."

<Mion>
"How can you both be so unsure?
 You'll both end up in last place together at this rate."
That's even worse!!
Going off buying something together as a couple.
 What if we ended up having to buy the "Happy family planning manual"...?!

<Rika>
"...I can tell from Keiichi's expression that he's not very good at this game."

<Keiichi>
"Wha!
 That's not true!
 I'll show you the true power of Sherlock Maebara during the next round!"

<Satoko>
"My, my~ That sounds just wonderful!!!
 I shall give you quite the thrashing!"
After that, I managed to somewhat grasp the trick behind the game, but I was still always a step or two behind.
...I saw that Mion was somehow gleaning information from how the others were asking their questions.
 ...That level of experience was just too much!
The only way I could stage a comeback was if I became ruthless!!!
I tossed out the simple concept of deduction and switched over to the thought process needed to win...
The important thing isn't to find out the criminal... It's to win at the game...!!
...Hm!
 Eureka!!!

<Keiichi>
"Ah, sorry, need to go to the bathroom."

<Mion>
"Take your time and squeeze out a nice one~!"

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, that's gross...!"
I had them hold off the game and headed down the hall.
The air was crisp.
It showed just how stagnant the air in the classroom was from our body heat.
On the school grounds, some of our classmates were still playing around.
After spending some time cooling my head, Rena had made her way over towards me.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun, did you call for me?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, I did."
As I got up from my seat I winked over at Rena.
I'm glad it worked out.

<Keiichi>
"I don't want to waste much time, so I'll get right to the point.
 Rena, what's your record at this game we're playing today?"
She was taken aback... after a moment, she hesitantly opened her mouth.

<Rena>
"Uh... um... Well... All losses.
 ...Why do you ask, I wonder... I wonder?"
I could tell from how apprehensively she was playing.

<Keiichi>
"The way things are going... I will, as well.
 I can't figure out a way to pull off a last minute comeback on this one!"

<Rena>
"S-Soo... I guess both of us will be taking that penalty...?"

<Keiichi>
"Hey, hey! Don't accept defeat already!
 How about we win this!?
 Both of us!"

<Rena>
"B-But... How can we!?"
I brought my lips up to Rena's ear.
 *whisper whisper whisper whisper*

<Rena>
"Huh? I-Is that allowed!?"

<Keiichi>
"Did you forget, Rena? The second rule of our society!
 Do everything in your power to obtain victory!"

<Rena>
"Y-Yeah! I-I'll try my best."
Our plan of attack was a quite rudimentary one.
At the beginning of the game, everyone would be focused on their own hand for a while, taking notes and whatnot.
Since our seats were right next to each other, we'd reveal our hands to each other!
If we did it under the desk, then nobody would know!
We'd begin the game with twice as much information as everyone else!
Having this much information would mean we'd need to investigate less!!

<Keiichi>
"...With this sort of plan of attack, we start off with a big lead over the other guys!"

<Rena>
"Y-Yeah! With this, we can probably win...!"
We both smirked at each other.
If I was the shady businessman, then Rena was the corrupt senator. Heh heh, pleasure doing business with you!!

<Rena>
"Then let's hurry back! We'll work as a duo to surprise everyone!"

<Keiichi>
"Hey, now!
 There's no point if we go back together!
 It would be like flat out telling them we made a little arrangement!"

<Rena>
"Oh, sorry. Then what should we do...?"

<Keiichi>
"Go back ahead of me, Rena.
 I'll take my time coming back after washing my face or something."

<Rena>
"Okay. Got it!"
Rena turned around and headed back to the classroom.
Hm, I guess I should wait a bit longer before going back...
If I went too soon, it wouldn't seem like I went to the bathroom. If Mion or one of them suspected something, then there could be problems...
Well, they'd figure it out sooner or later. Because both Rena and I would start winning over and over again!
Both Rena and I will have earned enough points to avoid being the losers by the time Mion realized what was happening!!
Excellent!
 Not bad at all!!

<Chie>
"Maebara-kun~
 May I have a moment?"
Huh? It's the teacher.
 ...Man, things were just getting good!!

<Keiichi>
"What is it? I'm a bit..."

<Chie>
"You have a guest.
 Please make your way to the entrance."

<Keiichi>
"A guest?
 It's not like I own a hotel..."

<Chie>
"They have been waiting. Please hurry."
Right before my big match was pretty bad timing to have a visitor, but the very fact that someone was here to see me was strange enough to pique my interest.
I didn't want to waste any time, so I decided to take care of it quickly.
The entryway was a heavy contrast from the hot sunlight and deep shadows.
Waiting there, looking uncomfortably warm, was a middle-aged man, his tie sloppily loosened, and his jacket tucked underneath his arm..

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Are you Maebara-san?
 Keiichi Maebara-san?"
There was no question that he wasn't a resident of Hinamizawa, and that this was without a doubt the first time he had met me.
...Ever since I met Tomitake-san, it seemed I was fated to meet middle-aged men...

<Keiichi>
"That's right.
 ...Who might you be?"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"I have the AC on in my car; let's talk there.
 It's a bit hot here, don't you think?"
The man, completely ignoring my question, pointed over to his car parked near the gate, and began walking.
Y-You've got to be kidding me. I had no intention of going along with some geezer I didn't even know, and he was asking me to get in his car with him!?

<Middle-Aged Man>
"I'm not going to bite.
 Come on, now."
He opened the back door of his car and called me over.
...I didn't like this old man but I wanted to know what this was about.
...Even while knowing that conversations that start out like this have never led to anything good.
The inside of his car was pretty cool.
Cars with air conditioners were supposed to be a luxury.
My dad didn't have one in his car, at least.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Please let me know if it's too cold for you, okay?
 I have a habit of cranking it all the way up."

<Keiichi>
"So what business do you have with me?"
Out of spite, I decided to ignore his remark in the same way he did to me and start my own line of questioning.
He pulled out a notepad from his pocket and took out a picture that was stuck between the pages.
On it was the face of a pretty goofy looking guy.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"If you know anything related to this individual, then please tell me."
Who the heck is this?
...I doubt even his close friends would be able to recognize who he was from this expressionless picture that looked like it was taken at the DMV.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"There were scribbles on his shirt done in permanent marker.
 Starting with yours, Maebara-san, and quite a few of your classmates signed, as well."

<Keiichi>
"...Huh?
 ...This is... Tomitake-san!?!?"
There was no hint of his usual unreliable and easygoing personality in this photo.
It was an expressionless, half-asleep face...

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Then do you know this woman?"
Even before seeing it, I had a good idea of who it was.

<Keiichi>
"...Uhh, I don't remember her name, but she's some lady who was with Tomitake-san last night."
I didn't know what her name was, but I did know she was a resident of Hinamizawa.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"When was the last time you saw these two?"

<Keiichi>
"The night of the Watanagashi. We spoke.
 ...They seemed pretty close, I guess..."

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Did anything bother you about them?
 Anything is fine.
 Go ahead and say it."
Being asked for every little detail is very troubling, honestly.
...I had a pretty good idea of who this guy was by now.

<Keiichi>
"Did something happen to them?"
There was no response to my inquiry.
Thus, I replied to that silence in kind.
I was pretty sure... no, certain... that this guy was a cop.
Then why??
Why was he asking about Tomitake-san?
 Did something happen to him?
More importantly, why me?
Shouldn't there have been plenty of other people who knew more about him than I did?
The roar of the air conditioner felt unbearably loud.
...After a long pause, he finally spoke again.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"You've moved here just recently. Isn't that right, Maebara-san?
 Are you aware, I wonder?
 About the stories
...
 of Oyashiro-sama."
My heart began to race.
I'm pretty terrible at hiding things.
 It probably showed on my face...

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Not at all?
 If you don't, then that's fine..."

<Keiichi>
"...Well... I have heard of it.
 Tomitake-san told me, actually..."

<Middle-Aged Man>
"How much do you know about it?"
The dismemberment killing.
 The accidental death.
 The death by illness, followed by suicide.
 And the lady who was beaten to death.
The incidents that always happen the day of the Watanagashi, ending in suspicious deaths...
I didn't think Tomitake-san would have kept anything from me.
 I think that was everything...
...No. Rather, I didn't want to think there was anything more than that.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Maebara-san... do you believe in the curse?
 Feel free to speak openly about it."

<Keiichi>
"I don't believe in it."
My answer was instant.
...It wasn't so much that I didn't believe in it as I was on the verge of believing. I wanted to clear away my own doubts. That was the more prominent feeling.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Really?
 Then that's great.
 Guess you really are one of those city-raised boys."

<Keiichi>
"So what if I don't believe?
 I have friends waiting, so could you get to the point?"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"The man in this picture is dead."

My mind went blank.
...Huh? What happened... to Tomitake-san?

<Middle-Aged Man>
"It would seem that he died last night.
 That was the night of the Watanagashi.
 Do you understand the implications behind that, Maebara-san?"

<Keiichi>
"Implications... not any at..."
Not any for the cause of his death or the reasons behind it.
...The real problem was that he died on the day of the Watanagashi...
Meaning... This year... The curse of Oyashiro-sama had once again...!

<Middle-Aged Man>
"The death of Jirou Tomitake is still confidential.
 You can understand why that is, right?"
I didn't want to understand why.

<Keiichi>
"...Please tell me.
 ...Tell me what happened."

<Middle-Aged Man>
"...It was rather peculiar.
 It might be a little too graphic for someone born and raised in Hinamizawa."
It was a roundabout way of saying it, but it caused me to doubt whether or not I wanted to hear the rest.
I would only regret forcing myself to learn of something I shouldn't.
...Or at least, that's how I figured I would feel if I listened to the rest...

<Middle-Aged Man>
"One of our patrol cars discovered the body on the way back from security detail at the festival.
 It was late. About five till midnight. 

<Middle-Aged Man>
The location... was, umm... you know where the road into town becomes paved, right?
 Down past the slope. On the shoulder, around there."
There were few street lights on that road.
Its pitch-black darkness was only broken by the lights of passing cars and the moon.
It was a stroke of luck that Tomitake-san was spotted collapsed on the shoulder of the road.
Tomitake-san was face-down, covered in blood.
 ...Blood and muck covered the asphalt...

<Middle-Aged Man>
"We thought it was a hit and run at first.

<Middle-Aged Man>
But when the officer checked to see if he was still alive, he quickly noticed something abnormal.
 ...His throat had been ripped open."

<Keiichi>
"F-From a knife or something...!?"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"No.
 Nails."
Nails!?
 As in fingernails!?
 You mean... his neck was clawed through...?!

<Middle-Aged Man>
"From the coroner's report, it was revealed that it was with his own nails."

<Keiichi>
"Huh? Wha? ...What... does that mean...?"
Basically, it means it wasn't a murder... It was suicide.
Tomitake-san - whatever was going through his mind - tore open his own throat!
 As hard as he could with his own nails.
...Tore through the skin until he started to bleed...
 And even then, Tomitake-san didn't stop.
 He continued clawing!!
With enough intensity that it could have peeled off his nails... still clawing!
 Still clawing!!
Then... as his nails reached those vital arteries that you should never damage... he continued clawing!
 Splurt
 ...Blood splattered on the ground around him.
As he bled...
 While gasping for breath...
 He collapsed... his body spasmed... and he died in agony.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"We thought drugs were to blame, but nothing of that nature was detected."
But this... It was a suicide!?
I've never heard of such a thing!!
...This unnatural way of dying...!!!
If this wasn't a mysterious death, then what was...?
The way he died... In these five years, his death most resembled that of a curse...!
As if to show both myself and Tomitake-san, who proclaimed there was no such thing as a curse, that we were wrong...!!

<Middle-Aged Man>
"There were a few more suspicious details.
 From his body chemistry, perspiration, epilation, and so on, we concluded that he was in a state of hysteria right before his death."
That was a given...
 It's hard to believe someone could be in a sound state of mind while clawing out their throat...

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Wounds on his hands matched a discarded piece of lumber found nearby.
 ...There are traces of where he struck trees and the guardrails with it.
 Tomitake-san's blood was found all over the place...
 ...meaning..."
Meaning that while tearing at his own throat, he was swinging around a piece of lumber.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"There were external injuries, which were not self-inflicted, discovered on Tomitake-san.
 ...There is a high probability Tomitake-san was assaulted.
 The external injuries suggest there may be multiple suspects."
To summarize:
Tomitake-san was surrounded and attacked.
While wandering the night roads in a state of panic, after being cornered, he picked up a piece of lumber and tried fighting back...
Somewhere in there, he began madly tearing at his own throat.
 ...Clawing at it!!
Then... he died.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"The presumed time of death was between 9pm and 11pm.
 Meaning... it occurred right after you finished talking to Tomitake-san at the festival."
Everyone signed Tomitake-san's shirt... then parted ways...
 ...Right after that...
Oh, yeah... He should have been with a woman.
 ...What about her!?

<Middle-Aged Man>
"She's missing.
 She hasn't shown up to work and she hasn't returned home, either.
 ...There is a very high probability that she was involved in this incident."
For a while, I could only gaze off into space.
I never would have thought that something unfortunate happening to somebody close to me could affect me this deeply...
The time I had spent with Tomitake-san was short.
...But we went to the same festival, spent time together, and took part in the same competition.
 ...He was one of us.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"We have been continuing the investigation on various fronts, but when it comes to Oyashiro-sama's curse, the villagers here aren't very cooperative..."
...That I knew well.
...I would have been none the wiser if not for Tomitake-san, the outsider, telling me...

<Keiichi>
"...So that's why you came to me?
 Because I'm not originally from Hinamizawa?"
I should have been angry that that was the reason he wanted to hear what happened from me...

<Middle-Aged Man>
"If things go the way they have been... then the conclusion would be that Jirou Tomitake died from Oyashiro-sama's curse."
He turned away from me and gazed far off into the distance.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"...The night of the Watanagashi. During that sacred ritual, he callously snapped off photos, angering Oyashiro-sama... That's how it's going to turn out."

<Keiichi>
"Th-There's no way Oyashiro-sama would inflict divine punishment on Tomitake-san...!"
Tomitake-san had to have been killed by humans—and a cowardly group, no less.
...There's no way I'm going to let this end up being the fault of some curse!

<Middle-Aged Man>
"I think so as well.
 There's no such thing as divine punishment or curses!!"
The tense mood was cut with the man's hearty laugh.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"That's how this must be, Maebara-san.
 ...Cooperation from individuals in Hinamizawa who don't believe in the curse is indispensable.
 Understand?"
Neither Tomitake-san nor I believed in curses.
...But with the way things were going, it would just end up with Tomitake-san's death marking the fifth year.
Which would mean that Hinamizawa had rejected Tomitake-san.
 That was something... I couldn't allow.
Tomitake-san was one of us.
He didn't live in Hinamizawa, but he came every single year... In a sense, he was more of a resident than I was.
There was no way that Tomitake-san could have been cursed by Oyashiro-sama...!

<Keiichi>
"But... there is nothing I can do to help.
 I have no idea what happened that night, either..."

<Middle-Aged Man>
"No, no. If you see or hear something that draws your attention, then that is enough."
If I see or hear? He was talking in the future tense.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Things or people or rumors.
 Anything is fine.
 I don't care if they're unfounded.
 ...Here, this is my number. If I'm not there, then just leave a message with whoever picks up."
He handed me a piece of paper with his number on it, but I hesitated for a second.
If I took it... then whether I wanted to or not, I'd be mired knee-deep in this matter.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Please help me solve these questions surrounding Tomitake-san's unfortunate death."
That's right.
 Why was I hesitating?
...I needed to find the murderer who killed my friend!
I snatched up the piece of paper as a satisfied grin spread across his face.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Everything we spoke of today is a secret.
 Please keep this confidential."

<Keiichi>
"Understood."

<Middle-Aged Man>
"From your friends, as well.
 Especially from Sonozaki-san and Furude-san; please do not inform them."

<Keiichi>
"Sonozaki? You mean Mion!?
 Why!? ...Are you saying they have something to do with the incident!?"
With my friends' names brought up so abruptly, and being told to keep it a secret from them, I became rather angry.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"...Hmm, this is what they call investigative privilege, I suppose."

<Keiichi>
"Don't play games with me!
 Mion is a close friend of mine!!"
I snapped at him, but he didn't seem to especially be offended.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"I wouldn't mind telling you
...
 but it may just upset you."

<Keiichi>
"Say it!!"
He hesitated a little.
Turning his gaze to the outside of the car, he began to speak after thinking for a bit.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"There is a possibility that the string of incidents happening here in Hinamizawa are a result of a village conspiracy."

<Keiichi>
"...Th-There's no way that could be right!!"
Give me a break!!
First of all... is there any proof of that!?

<Middle-Aged Man>
"No evidence.
 Also... each of the cases were resolved, and none of the perpetrators had any direct connection to the village."

<Keiichi>
"Then how did you come to that conclusion!?"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Every year... The enemies of the village die on the day of the Watanagashi.
 Don't you think that's enough reason to suspect something?"
Only the residents of Hinamizawa felt that the day of the Watanagashi was sacred.
 ...So basically... because incidents happened on that day, it was somehow related to Hinamizawa???

<Middle-Aged Man>
"First it was the dam construction foreman!
 Then it was a villager that supported it!
 Those the village hold a grudge against die one after the other from mysterious causes. 

<Middle-Aged Man>
The means are different, but in the end the result is the same."
Unfounded, unreasonable suspicion.
...But it couldn't just be shrugged off.

<Keiichi>
"So... the victims after that... What about the Shinto priest and his wife's death!?
 They weren't enemies of the village...!!"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"The villagers had expected leadership from the Shinto priest at the time of the dam dispute. But he wasn't proactive, so there was a faction of villagers who harbored ill will towards him as a result."

<Keiichi>
"Ill will? ...It's not like he did anything bad to the village!!

<Keiichi>
What about that housewife after that!?
 Did she die just because she was the wife of the brother of a supporter!? That's such a trivial reason to kill someone!

<Keiichi>
And what about Tomitake-san!!
 He's not affiliated with the dam project at all!!! Was he killed just because he was an outsider!?"
In the beginning it fell on those related to the dam project, but as the years went on, the "enemy threshold" of the victims had become much lower.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"...Well, that's the scary part.
 The bar keeps getting lower."

<Keiichi>
"What's scary about that...!?"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"It means... it's not just enemies of the village anymore. Just being an outsider could be reason enough."

<Keiichi>
"Then... You're saying that next year's victim... will be picked out of the 'village outsider' pool!?"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"It might be a person that just moved here."

<Keiichi>
"What do you mean by...?"
I swallowed my words.
Here in Hinamizawa... the ones who would be considered the most "outside"... would be...
 ...my family.
I was proof enough of that, wasn't I?
...I still couldn't really remember the names of the people I passed by...
Then... the next victims... my family...
 ...Was he saying it was going to be me...!?

<Keiichi>
"But... what does that have to do with Mion!?"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"I can't go into details, but the Sonozaki family led the dam protests.
 Quite fervently so.

<Middle-Aged Man>
This is also true of Mion Sonozaki-san herself.
 She has quite a few misdemeanor and obstruction of public worker offenses on her record because of the protests."
I knew Mion had 'fought.'
...This was the first I'd heard of her family leading the protests though.
...Then, well... what did it all mean...?

<Keiichi>
"...Are you saying that... Mion's family is involved with this string of incidents?"

<Middle-Aged Man>
"I wouldn't go that far.
 I'm just saying... that if it was a conspiracy... then they'd have the highest probability of being behind it."
Not a very clear explanation.
It felt like he'd magnificently avoided the details I really wanted to know.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"We don't know who or how involved anyone is right now.
 ...That is exactly why I don't want you to say anything to the villagers."
Instead of answering, I gave a very bitter expression.
 ...It seemed that he understood it well enough.

<Middle-Aged Man>
"Then think of it like this...
 ...I don't want to worry the villagers who blindly believe it's the curse.
 ...How about that?"
What do you mean "How about that?" How should I know?
But the reasoning behind wanting me to not carelessly open my mouth about it wasn't too hard to comprehend.
The perpetrator was here.
It had nothing to do with a curse.
He was definitely going to be caught by the police and made to pay for his crimes.
And none of the villagers should have anything to do with that process.
It may cause those sensitive about the curse... to just worry needlessly.

<Keiichi>
"...Just like everyone kept it from me so I wouldn't worry about it.
 ...Is it now my turn to keep it from them so they didn't have to worry?"
I was just talking to myself.
Unlike me, everyone else had been worrying over these mysterious incidents yearly. And the incident this time probably means a lot more to them...
I didn't... I didn't want to burden them anymore...
In the end, everything went as the man had wanted, as insipid as it was. But it couldn't be helped...

<Keiichi>
"I understand. I'll keep it to myself.
 Is that fine? ...Umm... Mr..."

<Ooishi>
"Ooishi, from the Okinomiya Police Station.
 You can call me Kura-chan if you want."

<Keiichi>
"Ah, no, Ooishi-san is fine..."
The way he said it was unpleasant, yet retained hints of politeness. He was the spitting image of a vulgar police officer.
...Though, I've never seen one this bulky before in the cop shows I watch...

<Ooishi>
"...I've taken up too much time.
 Your friends are waiting, aren't they?
 I should probably let you get back to them."
The door opened with a click and in streamed the oppressive heat.
It was blistering outside of the car. Was it really this hot of a day...?
It was an almost cruel heat, as opposed to the mechanical coolness inside the car.
It was as if... the land of Hinamizawa itself suddenly hated me... I felt a little sad as that thought crossed my mind.

<Ooishi>
"I didn't mean to suspect your friends.
 Please don't misunderstand that."
I refrained from telling him that it was too late to say something that self-serving.

<Ooishi>
"It's fine if you don't see or hear anything, Maebara-san.
 ...It would help to prove that the village is not involved, after all."

<Keiichi>
"I'll contact you if I hear or see anything...
 but I'm no detective.
 Please don't expect too much from me."

<Ooishi>
"I won't!
 You don't have to become a detective.
 Just go on living as you have up until now.
 Just let me know if you notice anything."
I hastily made my way back to the school building after giving him a quick bow.

<Ooishi>
"See you later. Farewell, Maebara-kun!"
I returned to the school building without looking back.
I don't know how much time had passed.
I did feel bad for keeping them waiting, but right now there was a lot on my mind.
...Tomitake-san's death was hard enough as it was... But to think that there was the possibility of a village conspiracy?
Worse still... there was also a chance that Mion was involved??
Nonsense...
Impossible. Not Mion, Rena, Satoko, or Rika-chan.
It was a group that attacked Tomitake-san?
Who could the perpetrators be?
...Could it be... They were hiding here, somewhere in Hinamizawa...?
...I didn't know.
...All I could say for certain was that I knew that Mion couldn't be the perpetrator.

<Rena>
"It's Mii-chan!!
 The perpetrator!!"
Huh?
 ...I was startled to hear Rena's voice.

<Rena>
"With the 'Rope,' in the...
 hmm...
 'Lounge'!!!"

<Mion>
"Bwahahaha!!
 Nooope~~!!"

<Rena>
"NooOoOoOOo!!!"
Rena clutched her head while flailing about.
...Looks like you're just self-destructing over here, wow.

<Satoko>
"Aaah!!
 Keiichi-san, you're quite late!!
 As you may well know, I'm seething with anger!"

<Keiichi>
"A-Ah, sorry about that...
 I was called into the staff room, you see..."

<Rika>
"You were reprimanded for bad behavior?
 ...That's a shame."

<Mion>
"Well, it's been pretty heated over here!
 Since it's getting pretty late, let's make the next game the last one."

<Keiichi>
"If I remember right... I had zero points...
 ...Isn't it pretty much decided that I'm going to be finishing in last place?"

<Rena>
"D-Don't worry, Keiichi-kun.
 ...I'm at -1 points.
 ...Hau~..."
The heck!?
 Her score is lower than mine and I wasn't even playing.

<Mion>
"This is the final match to decide if the penalty is going to be carried out by Rena alone or by both Kei-chan and Rena!!"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, right.
 Just let Rena do the penalty by herself!"

<Rena>
"...We made a promise, Keiichi-kun... That we would both win
 ...
 ...I waited all this time, you know? ...You know?"

<Keiichi>
"...Urk... I'm sorry about that..."
I followed my initial plan of showing Rena my cards, but I didn't say who was the criminal and just waited for her to call.

<Rena>
"I got it!!!
 The murderer is 'me'!!
 With the 'Poison,' at the 'Entrance'!!
 Is it!? Is it!?"

<Mion>
"My, my, Rena... Quite a quick answer~?
 Another stab in the dark?
 ...Oh."

<Rika>
"...Rena's correct."

<Satoko>
"O~h ho ho ho!!
 Then it's decided that Keiichi-san shall take part in the penalty as well!!"

<Rena>
"Hurraaay!!
 Keiichi-kun, let's both do our best!☆"

<Keiichi>
"Y-Yeah... Let's do our best... hahaha..."
It's my fault, so I have no choice...

<Mion>
"Then that's game!
 It's me, Mion Sonozaki, ranked first!
 In dead last are Keiichi Maebara and Rena Ryuugu!!"
Everyone applauded and the game ended.
...The problem now... was the penalty...

<Mion>
"Now, then. I ranked first, so I'll decide what you'll be buying for the gofer penalty!"

<Rena>
"...Wh-What will she make us buy, I wonder... I wonder?"

<Keiichi>
"Let's blacklist the drugstore. That was your aim, wasn't it!?"

<Mion>
"Huh?
 I don't have any business at the drugstore.
 This old man's already got a list prepared for you on this piece of paper~!"

<Rena>
"Whoa... There's a lot written here..."
A-A lot!?
Damn it, what is she making us buy!?

<Keiichi>
"...Two blocks of tofu.
 Shampoo and conditioner.
 Apple vinegar and fried tofu.
 The heck is this?"

<Satoko>
"It looks more like... a shopping list than a penalty..."

<Rika>
"...Mii was certain she was going to win today."

<Mion>
"Rule seven of our society!!!!
 You cannot refuse any penalty!!!
 Here's some money. The shampoo I usually get is Fruit Fable.
 Thanks!"

<Keiichi>
"Th-This is just... your grocery liiisssttt!!!"
I promised myself that if I won next time, I'd make her go buy hemorrhoid cream...



[Onikakushi Ch.9]

Sleepy.

<Rena>
"Whoa... That was a really big yawn, Keiichi-kun."
I'm usually awake once it's time to eat... But doesn't look like I can do it today...

<Keiichi>
"I was watching TV until late last night... I'm so tired right now..."

<Mion>
"Was one of those raunchy TV shows you love so much on last night?"

<Satoko>
"H-H-How extremely vile~!!"

<Keiichi>
"Wait a second! Don't imagine things and jump to conclusions!!!"

<Rika>
"...It's perfectly normal for boys. Nothing to be ashamed about."
Rika not patting my head only made me feel worse.

<Keiichi>
"Could you just let me... pass out this lunch break?
 ...No, seriously."

<Satoko>
"My, you think I would just sit here and allow that?"

<Keiichi>
"I'll get really angry if you disturb me.
 Really angry!
 ...Yaawwnn ahh..."
This was just dreadful.
Just so... sleepy...
I slumped my head onto the desk and drifted off into an afternoon nap.
It seemed that Satoko had responded, but I pretended not to hear.

<Rena>
"...Cut it out, Satoko-chan.
 Keiichi-kun fell asleep.
 ...His sleeping face... so kyute.☆"

<Mion>
"You can take him home later.
 Let him be for now."

<Rika>
"...Let's move over there.
 It'd be rude to Keiichi if we bothered him now."
...Rika-chan really is a good girl...

<Rika>
"Let's not wake him up even if the teacher comes back."
I take that back.
The excuse that I didn't sleep much last night because I was watching TV was a lie.
I was in bed at the usual time, but... because of the conversation with Ooishi-san that afternoon, I didn't get much sleep.
Just spending the day like this... It's almost as if the incident with Tomitake-san didn't happen at all.
...It made me think... Was Ooishi-san just trying to deceive me?
But... it was probably the truth.
...One thing was certain, I couldn't speak to anyone about it.
He wanted my assistance, but... I really didn't know anything about it.
If I knew I wasn't going to be of any help, I probably wouldn't have listened in the first place.
It ended up with me, again... regretting learning something I didn't need to know...
If I had never learned about it, I would, without a doubt, be goofing off with the rest of them right now.
...I couldn't help but resent Ooishi-san for this.

<Rena>
"...Huh? ...When was that?"

<Mion>
"I heard he wasn't there the next day.
 ...It appears he vanished the night of the Watanagashi."
Mion whispered to keep others from listening, but I could hear it clearly.
On the other hand, Rena's voice was even harder to pick up.
But I could still tell that she was quite upset.
...It couldn't be... Are they talking about Tomitake-san...!?

<Rena>
"...nly... itake?"

<Mion>
"Not sure.
 That's all I know."
I would have to feign ignorance about this topic because I needed to keep it a secret.
Rather than waking up and being forced to lie to join the conversation, it was much easier just to sit here and pretend I was asleep to listen in on their discussion.
Wait... why did I have to pretend to be asleep while eavesdropping on my friends' conversation...?
The guilt... stung.

<Rena>
"...So... and me... there are others, right?
 ...too."

<Mion>
"...but they don't know if it's from the curse or if this was an Onikakushi..."
Onikakushi...?
 Oni-kakushi...?
 To be hidden away by a demon?
What a mysterious phrase.
...I did, however, get the feeling it meant nothing good.

<Rena>
"...eah... ell... there was another, right?
 ...right?"

<Mion>
"If it's Oyashiro-sama's... yeah."

<Rena>
"But, but...!
 ...This year th... at all...?"

<Mion>
"Grandma and the Mayor had talked about it.
 ...Seems they talked to the police about it beforehand.
 ...They said they'd take care of whatever happens this year without causing a commotion."

<Rena>
"Then... without us knowing it... someone had...
 ...ed them... you mean...?"

<Mion>
"...aybe."

<Rena>
"...Next could... me...
 ...I wonder..."

<Mion>
"...Don't worry.
 You got home safely."

<Rena>
"...but... is... not allowed, right...?"

<Mion>
"That was a long time ago.
 Let's stop talking about this."
Amidst the uncomfortable mood, both of them went silent.
The entirety of the conversation was still a bit unclear, but... a few parts caught my attention.
First of all, the term "Onikakushi."
...To be 'demoned away.' By the context it was used in, I would guess it's similar to being spirited away.
...I suspected that was what it meant because Tomitake-san and that woman (it really bugged me that I don't know her name...) vanished after the Watanagashi.
The next thing that stuck out was when Rena said, "There's another one, right?"
Mion also said, "If it's Oyashiro-sama's, yeah," responding to something.
If it's Oyashiro-sama's curse... then there had to be two victims... is that what she meant...?
Come to think of it... I remember Mion saying at the beginning that they didn't know if it was from the curse, or if it was a case of Onikakushi.
It seems that the curse and being demoned away are different things, and they were "phenomena" that were paired together...
I recalled Tomitake-san's terrible end...
That wasn't something as elegant as disappearing.
 ...That horrendous end would best be described as "cursed."
Then... the woman with him... it means she vanished because she was demoned away...?
What I do know is... that there's normally an even number of victims of the curse proper.
And... the last point that bothered me was Rena.
Rena was frightened.
...For what reason, I didn't know.
However, she knew that something had made her a potential target for Oyashiro-sama's curse...
If I recall correctly... Oyashiro-sama should be the guardian deity of Hinamizawa.
...Isn't a guardian deity supposed to defend the citizens and drive out invaders...?
If I recall correctly, yesterday Ooishi-san said that originally the targets were enemies of the village. But recently, there was no longer any distinction between them or regular outsiders.
But if that was the case... then I would think that I'd be the more likely target, having moved here more recently than Rena.
From her composure, I could infer that she was grimly certain that... she would be next.
...I should probably relay what I heard just now to Ooishi-san.
Informing the police of what I heard by eavesdropping on my friends while pretending to be asleep...
...It made me feel terrible.
It raised a few questions and left me with a bad taste in my mouth...
Would it be better not to seek the answers to those questions...?
As I continued to learn more and more, I felt like I had fallen past the point of no return...
I would definitely regret this one day.
...I would definitely regret ever having learned of these events...

<Satoko>
"The teacher approaches~!!
 Keiichi-saan!
 You must awaken!!"
In the distance, I could hear the ring of the handbell signaling the start of afternoon classes.
 ...Geh! I couldn't sleep at all!
I hastily opened my eyes and raised my head up.
It was in that moment, when I leaned against the back of my seat...

<Keiichi>
 "Owwugh!?!?"
There was a thumbtack stuck on the back of my chair with tape.
...Circumstantial evidence was enough...!

<Keiichi>
"SATOKoOoOOo!!!"
Guilty without trial!!
Capital punishment!!!!
I furiously jumped up from my seat!!
 ...and I tripped as if my feet were tangled up.
My shoelaces had been tied together!

<Keiichi>
"N-Not bad, Satokoooo!!
 While I was sleeping, you were able to conceal your presence to pull off this fine piece of work!"
The teacher came in right as I was about to pull off my shoes and tackle Satoko.

<Satoko>
"Oh ho ho!!
 Did you not notice that our teacher has arrived, Keiichi-san?
 Take your seat~!"
*clomp clomp*
 *whish*
 *bwif*
Not caring one bit, I made her eat a flick to the forehead.

<Satoko>
"B-Bwaaaaaah!!
 Keiichi-san is being mean...!!"

<Chie>
"Hey!
 Don't pick on the younger kids, Maebara-kun!
 Apologize to her!"
I saw Satoko stick her tongue out at me... That little braaat!!!

<Chie>
"Come on! Maebara-kun!?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, yeah, I'll apologize.
 Sorry, Satoko-san."
In any case, I apologized, even if it was in a completely insincere tone of voice.
...Damn her, I'll remember this!!

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, Kei-chan. Get your revenge at the club meeting!
 Take your seat, take your seat."
I sat down after Mion told me to. She'd switched to class representative mode.
With the boring classes finished, school was finally over for the day.
Now then, what should we do for our club today!?
Personally... I would like to play that deduction game one more time.
...I was hardly able to play it last time because of Ooishi-san.
Rena and I weren't even able to test out our strategy!

<Rena>
"That's right. Today, Keiichi-kun and I will be victorious!"

<Satoko>
"What should we do...?
 We've never played the same game two days in a row before."

<Rika>
"...Why not try asking Mii?"
Mion looked over her shoulder as we made eye contact. She slowly tapped her palm with her fist as her face suddenly lit up.

<Mion>
"Ooops!
 I completely forgot, I need to go help my uncle today...!
 Sorry, guys! Not today!"

<Keiichi>
"Helping your uncle~?
 Aren't you a little goody-two-shoes!"

<Mion>
"Sorry, really...!
 I really did forget... Well, then... sorry, guys!
 This old man is heading back home now!"
Mion left us with that and rushed off to the exit after snatching up her bag.

<Rena>
"You see, Mii-chan... She sometimes goes to help out at her uncle's shop in town."
Ahh... I thought she wasn't the type to get caught up in such bothersome stuff.

<Satoko>
"She said that she gets paid for it.
 It's quite a bit of spending money, from what I hear."
I see.
 She was able to pay for that mountain of games with what she saved up from there.

<Keiichi>
"But that... wouldn't you call that a part-time job?
 Isn't that against school policy!?"

<Rika>
"...There's a clause that states household chores are excluded."
Is that what she's calling it...?
...So what now?
 Pass on the club today?

<Rena>
"...So... we're done today, I guess? ...I guess?"

<Keiichi>
"Won't it be fine even without the club president?
 ...Let's do this!"
I opened the club locker and began searching for the deduction game from that ever-growing pile of games.

<Keiichi>
"Ah, here it is!
 The deduction game from yesterday!
 Man, I had to stop just as I was getting the hang of it."
At the very least, I wanted to repay Satoko for what she did during the afternoon break!!

<Satoko>
"I do not mind.
 But is that fine for Rena-san and Rika?"

<Rena>
"Umm
 ...If Keiichi-kun wants to so badly, I wouldn't mind playing for a bit."

<Rika>
"...I think... it's better if we do it when we have everyone together."
Mmm... When she says it like that... hmmmm.

<Rika>
"I wanted to go shopping if there wasn't a club meeting today.
 ...Going to buy soy sauce and other things."

<Satoko>
"Oh! ...That's right!
 I completely forgot."

<Rena>
"Well... I guess since it's been a while, I should go treasure hunting...!"
What's this, now? ...Everyone was no longer in the mood for club activities.
If I kept on trying to push the matter, it may make them realize I had a trick up my sleeve...
...Ah, well. I'll give up this time.

<Keiichi>
"Man, I really was looking forward to playing it..."
I shuffled through the cards as if I was still caught up on it.

<Satoko>
"At the next opportunity, I shall give you a sound thrashing!
 Oh ho ho!!"

<Keiichi>
"The murderer is 'Satoko'!
 The murder weapon is the 'Pistol'!
 It was you after all!!"

<Satoko>
"Wh-What did you say!?
 Then I'll just...!!"
Satoko looked through the cards on the desk and stuck out three of them at me.

<Satoko>
"The murderer is 'Keiichi'!
 In the 'Lounge' with the 'Rope'!!"

<Keiichi>
"I don't need no rope!
 I'll just strangle you like this!!"

<Satoko>
"Nooooo!!
 Keiichi-san is such a beast!!!!"
Phew.
 ...Well, I guess it's good that I got that out of my system.

<Satoko>
"Bwaaaaah!!
 I'll remember this, Keiichi-san!!"

<Rika>
"...Being picked on so much by Keiichi-kun.
 You poor thing."

<Rena>
"Ahahaha☆ ...Kyute, kyute...☆"
Everyone got ready to go back home.
I also helped gather up the scattered cards.
I suddenly paused.
 ...They were just the suspect cards... but I noticed something strange.
"Rena"
 "Satoko"
 "Rika"
 "Keiichi"
 "Mion"
 ...
 "Satoshi"
Satoshi?
...Not all the cards were made by us.
Or at least, every card besides this one has the name of a club member.
...Does this mean that this Satoshi fellow... is a member?
Was there someone in the class named Satoshi...?
I couldn't find anyone named Satoshi on the class roster stuck up on the wall.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun! Let's hurry and finish cleaning up!"
Being rushed by Rena, I finished up quickly.
Satoko and Rika-chan had already headed merrily for their lockers, so we were the only ones left in the classroom.
Right now, Rena had already gotten her bag and was ready to leave.

<Keiichi>
"Rena.
 There must be quite a few people who transfer from this school... right?"
I tried asking Rena in a bit of a roundabout way.
Rena made a troubled face and then answered.

<Rena>
"...Yeah.
 Hinamizawa is a rural town, right?
 Some people transfer out every now and then."

<Keiichi>
"Then is Satoshi another one of those transferees?"

<Rena>
"Sorry!
 ...
I don't really know."
There was a bit of a pause, but the answer was pretty much immediate.

<Rena>
"Ah, um... I'm not saying it to be mean!
 ...Just last year...
 I transferred in... so maybe I just missed him.
 So I didn't hear much about him.
 ...Sorry!"
I am not sure, sorry.
Her answer was a lot like when she refused to tell me about the murder at the dam.
I was saddened by her denial... and felt a little bit of anger.
I'm... their friend, aren't I?
Friends... don't keep secrets from their friends, do they?
Though I do appreciate that they kept that unsettling curse thing from me.
...But... if everyone is worried about it, I'd rather be worried with them.
...That's... That's what it means to be friends, right...?
For a moment, I wondered just what kind of face I was making just then... with these mixed feelings of sadness and annoyance...

<Rena>
"K... Keiichi-kun... you're making a scary face.
 ...Why is it? ...Why?"
It was probably exactly the kind of face Rena said it was.
...It appeared my grim expression had frightened her.

<Keiichi>
"Ah, sorry.
 ...I was really looking forward to the club today, I'm just feeling down about it."
I rustled Rena's hair.

<Keiichi>
"Let's go home."
Dragging that awkward mood with us, we headed home.
I wonder why.
...Why have I been getting this dumb feeling lately...?
I didn't know anything... I had nothing to worry about... I was just enjoying my everyday life.
My long, outstretched shadow gave no answer to my naive inquiry.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun, are you tired, maybe...?
 ...Maybe?"
Rena timidly questioned the reason behind my mood.
...I'm sure my expression made this situation even more unsettling.

<Keiichi>
"...You think so?"

<Rena>
"Y-Yeah.
 ...You seemed to have been a little out of it ever since this morning.
 Maybe... a cold?"
Physically, I was pretty sure I was in perfect health.
 It may not seem like it, but I've had perfect attendance since elementary school.
Rena continued on since I didn't give her an answer.

<Rena>
"It could be that the fatigue from moving has finally caught up to you.
 ...It's completely different from where you used to live, after all. 

<Rena>
Of course you've gotten tired... since there's so much you need to get used to and remember."

<Keiichi>
"Maybe that's it."

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 It has to be.
 Rena was also like that at first, too.
 I can tell, you know?
 ...You know?"
...I wondered if Rena also experienced the slight bit of alienation last year that I was feeling right now.
...Thinking so, I felt that she was the only one who could understand how I felt.

<Keiichi>
"I'd like to hear about when you first came to Hinamizawa.
 ...How was it?"
Feeling I had been drawn into the conversation, her face suddenly brightened.

<Rena>
"Ahahaha.
 It was the same as Keiichi-kun.
 I didn't know the villagers' names at all.
 Mii-chan and the rest were all very kind so I wasn't lonely, but I did still feel a little out of place."
Rena told me all the details of when she had moved here.
All of her first acquaintances and surprises. Worries and good times.

<Keiichi>
"So... Satoko got you, too!?"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 There was a thumb tack put on my chair.
 Poke.
 ...Then with that, I...
 ...
Yeah.
 That really takes me back!"

<Keiichi>
"When were you invited into the club?
 The first day?"

<Rena>
"Nah.
 ...There wasn't a club at the beginning.
 It was formed partway through.
 ...One day, she said we should stay after and hold a big game tournament."

<Keiichi>
"Come to think of it... Mion did say she was the first club president.
 Now I get it."

<Rena>
"This is a secret, but Mii-chan used to be really bad at the beginning.
 She'd never win."

<Keiichi>
"Huh!?
 Mion, really!?
 ...I can't even imagine that!"

<Rena>
"She had to do most of the penalties that she came up with.
 Ahaha!
 Seriously, don't tell!"
I can't believe Mion was like that...!
...So she gradually transformed into a monster who used any means necessary to win during that time.
Mion is at her best when she's fighting dirty!

<Rena>
"I began making more friends besides Mii-chan after that... but, yeah.
 It might have only been since you moved here.
 That I had finally felt like I had gotten used to it here."
I guess Rena... had also been left in the dark about Oyashiro-sama when she had just moved here.
...I guess when they finally told me about Oyashiro-sama, I'd be considered one of them.

<Keiichi>
"I wonder when I'll finally be considered one of them."

<Rena>
"Huh?
 Did you say something?"

<Keiichi>
"...No, sorry.
 Just talking to myself."

<Rena>
"Ahahaha. Keiichi-kun, you're silly."
Rena was poking fun and laughing at me, and I couldn't help but laugh as well...
But I suddenly stopped.
Then... after making up my mind, I spoke.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, Rena.
 ...Is there something... that everybody is keeping from me...?"

<Rena>
"Huh.
 ...No.
 Not at all."

<Keiichi>
"You're lying, aren't you...?"
Rena suddenly stopped.
Her expression was cold and intense.

<Rena>
"What do you mean by that,
 Keiichi-kun?"
Her tone was still the same cheery and lighthearted one as before.

<Keiichi>
"You are, aren't you...?
 ...Keeping something from me?"
After understanding what I meant, her expression grew even more intense.
...Seeing that face, I regretted saying something so rash.
...But she came back at me in a way I didn't expect.

<Rena>
"Well then, Keiichi-kun.
 ...Aren't you keeping something from us?"

<Keiichi>
"...Huh?"
Her tone didn't change... but it was the first time I'd seen this expression from Rena.
With how her gaze pierced through me, I couldn't believe this was the same Rena.

<Rena>
"Aren't you?
 Lies or secrets...
 ...Aren't you?"
You are.
 Secrets...
...She didn't actually say that part... but she looked as if she did.
The incident with Tomitake-san... and how I felt alienated from the group.
...Even without having to think about it... there were things I knew that I felt guilty about...
But... I didn't tell everyone about what happened with Tomitake-san... to be considerate.
...I was keeping it a secret just the same way they didn't tell me about Oyashiro-sama...
Then... aren't we even...!?

<Keiichi>
"...No, I'm not.
 ...No lies.
 Nor secrets."

<Rena>
"Liar."
Her answer was instant and it shook me.
Rena stared as if burrowing through me.
Watching me... like a hawk.

<Keiichi>
"...Why would you say I'm lying...?"

<Rena>
"Didn't you say that you were called into the teacher's room yesterday during the club meeting, Keiichi-kun!?
 I know...
 You didn't go to the teacher's room."
I swallowed hard...
It clearly wasn't a bluff... she knew what happened.

<Rena>
"The teacher said you had a guest, didn't she?
 But you didn't talk at the entrance.
 You talked inside of the car near the school gate.
 With some man we don't know!"
Rena... knew everything...
She knew that I was called out by Ooishi-san and that I heard about the incident with Tomitake-san as well... Did she know all of it!?

<Rena>
"Exactly who was that man?"

<Keiichi>
"I-I don't know him...!"

<Rena>
"Why did someone you don't know have business with you?"

<Keiichi>
"I... I want to know that, myself!"

<Rena>
"Then what did you talk about!?"

<Keiichi>
"It has nothing to do with you guys...!"
It was a lie.
"LIES!!!"

Rena's scream echoed through the trees...
Sending frightened birds into the air.
I couldn't exhale the deep breath I had just taken.
 No. It was like I wasn't allowed to exhale.
It was here... I first realized...
...The person in front of me... She wasn't Rena Ryuugu.
...Then... Who was it that was standing before me now?
...Who had assumed Rena Ryuugu's appearance!?
I had held my breath for so long, I could feel myself suffocating...

<Rena>
"Right?"
And then she made a facial expression that Rena normally might have made.
...It didn't matter that it was Rena's usual smile... It chilled me to the bone.
She drew closer to me.
I felt her breath against my face.
...It wasn't the least bit exciting.
Whoever this was with Rena's face was going to chew my nose right off...!!
...I cowered as I imagined that.
Then... she smirked as if she was able to see right through me.

<Rena>
"We also have secrets... just like how Keiichi-kun has secrets!"
It was Rena's usual smile...
...But her eyes were still like that of a hawk's.
...Bringing her face close enough to mine to almost bump into my nose... She 'kindly' persuaded me.
I couldn't nod or shake my head.
This person standing in front of me... this person who looked like Rena, frightened me to my core.
I was terrified knowing that she could hear the sound of me swallowing nervously.
After what felt like an eternity, after a long empty silence, she finally spoke...

<Rena>
"Let's go.
 ...It's getting chilly."
It was Rena again.
Smiling at me once more, she started walking as if nothing at all had happened.
...When I was released from her gaze... My legs gave out from under me and I slumped onto the ground...
...I wasn't able to lift a finger until Rena was out of sight.

<Keiichi>
"...Who was... that...?"
...I felt cold. My body was drenched in sweat.
I was finally able to form a coherent thought and asked myself once again.
Who was... that person...
 ...who looked like Rena Ryuugu!?
I was out of it and couldn't bring myself to do anything until dinner except stare blankly into space.
Was I terrified from Rena going off on me?
...No, that's not right.
That was someone else who only looked like Rena.
Then... who could it have been?
It was a dreadful feeling...
...Knowing that that was someone else, not Rena. So tomorrow I shouldn't have a problem talking to Rena like I usually do.
That thought was strangely comforting.
I concluded that I should just calm down and clear my head.
...Though those thoughts continued swirling around my mind.
Finally, I returned to my senses as I heard my mother calling out to me from the bottom of the stairs.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi~!
 It's a call from the bookstore~."
Bookstore?
 Can't think of why they'd be calling me.
...I went downstairs and picked up the receiver anyway.

<Ooishi>
"My apologies for calling so late at night.
 It's me, Ooishi of the Okinomiya bookshop."

<Keiichi>
"Ooishi-san?
 ...Oh, it's Ooishi-san!"

<Ooishi>
"Sorry.
 Since your parents picked up I said I was from the bookstore.

<Ooishi>
It puts people off when I say I'm a police officer."
Ooishi-san was, in his own way, rather courteous.
Even so, I didn't want my parents hearing me talk to the police.
...I brought the cordless phone with me as I dashed back up to my room on the second floor.

<Ooishi>
"Sorry for calling so late.
 That phone number on the piece of paper I gave you yesterday was the old number.
 My apologies.
 Can you copy down the number I'm about to give you?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, yeah.
 ...Uum... okay."
He gave me the number for his direct line as I wrote it down.
I thought that was the end of it, but he began making pointless small talk, and it was pretty hard to hang up.

<Ooishi>
"So how has it been, Maebara-san?
 Did anything strange happen recently?"
...I see.
 This was the real reason.
He really beat around the bush there. His adult conversational skills left me slack-jawed.

<Keiichi>
"Are you... from around here, Ooishi-san?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, I am.
 Born and raised in Okinomiya."
If he's from around here... he might know.

<Keiichi>
"Um, Ooishi-san.
 ...Do you know what this 'Onikakushi' thing is about?'"

<Ooishi>
"Hm... I believe... that's when somebody suddenly vanishes because they've been abducted by a demon.
 It's a special saying from around here.
 It has the same meaning as 'spirited away' like everyone else says."
Whereas my friends would say they didn't know when I asked... this older man gave me a direct answer.
...It made me a bit happy that he answered me directly without trying to hide anything.

<Ooishi>
"Hinamizawa was... um, not sure if I should tell you this, Maebara-san."

<Keiichi>
"Don't try to play this off.
 If you're not going to talk, then I'm not going to tell you anything!"

<Ooishi>
"Ah, no no!
 That's not what I meant.  It's just... it may make you feel bad.
 ...You see... long ago, Hinamizawa was feared as the village where demons reside."

<Keiichi>
"Demons?
 By demons you mean... those pitchfork-carrying things in Hell?"

<Ooishi>
"Hmm~ more like human-eating monsters.
 They'd go down to villages snatching people up and gobbling them down. That kind of tale."
Demons snatching up people is what this "Onikakushi" really means.

<Keiichi>
"...They said that the curse and being demoned away happen together.
 ...What does that mean?"
I already knew about the mysterious deaths happening five years in a row.
...But I didn't know there were people disappearing for those same five years.

<Ooishi>
"The curse and being demoned away happen together?
 First time I've heard of that.
 Is that how it is, Maebara-san?"

<Keiichi>
"That's what I want to know.
 ...I heard Rena and Mion talking. They said that if it was really Oyashiro-sama's curse, then both the curse and demoning away would happen."
Ooishi-san began hemming and hawing on the other end of the receiver.
...Maybe something about that came to mind?

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san.
 Do you know the first incident?
 The murder by dismemberment."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah.
 One of the six perpetrators is still on the run, right?"

<Ooishi>
"Hypothetically...
 What if he isn't on the run, but was demoned away?"
Huh!?
 ...It was an outrageous hypothesis from Ooishi-san.
The incident four years ago was the particularly ghastly one.
The police already knew the perpetrators.
So they posted tons of wanted posters with his face on them.
They staked out various locations and investigated every possible escape route he had.
But... after four years, there wasn't even a hint of where he might be.
 ...Unless the police were completely incompetent.
Even if it was an outrageous hypothesis, I couldn't simply laugh it off...

<Keiichi>
"Then what about the incident the next year?
 When the man who supported the project and his wife both died in an accident?"

<Ooishi>
"Well, actually.
 ...It was only the husband who died in an accident.
 His wife's body never surfaced.
 ...Unless we find the body, then it's considered a missing person by law."
At the time of the incident, with the river below the cliff being muddy rapids...
The police divers had searched every branch off the main stream of the river for dozens of miles. But in the end, they weren't able to find her body.

<Keiichi>
"But... That's just them not being able to find the body. She's still dead, right?
 Isn't it different from her being demoned away...?"

<Ooishi>
"We cannot say someone is dead without their body.
 Until a certain number of years pass, by law she's treated as still alive."
I'm not sure if it was right to call that being demoned away...
The wife is missing.
At least that part was reality.

<Keiichi>
"How about the 3rd year?
 The Shinto priest died of illness.
 And his wife committed suicide...?"

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san.
 That's actually the exact same scenario."
The wife had supposedly thrown herself into the bottomless swamp deep in the forest around Hinamizawa.
...Meaning it's all circumstantial evidence.
They simply found her suicide note in front of the swamp...
...A diver was able to recover a few of her articles, but they weren't able to find a body.
The investigative headquarters believed that she had faked her death and was still alive somewhere.

<Ooishi>
"I'm not sure if we could refer these cases as being demoned away.
 It's just as you've said. Every year, one person does go missing."

<Keiichi>
"The incident this year... The woman with Tomitake-san has gone missing...
 Then what about the incident with the housewife beaten to death?
 Who went missing?
 ...I believe the perpetrator was caught, right?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, we arrested him.
 He already had a criminal record from before.
 He admitted to the crime while being questioned about a different incident.
 But... well, you see... 

<Ooishi>
After he was arrested... a child from the victim's home went missing.
 It's still under investigation...
 As to whether the disappearance had anything to do with the crime."

<Keiichi>
"But you said you caught him, right?
 Did he have an accomplice!?"

<Ooishi>
"No idea... It was most likely only the one perpetrator.
 Moreover, we can't even check now.
 ...Because while under investigation, that man... he died in his holding cell."
He swallowed a spork and choked to death.
It's not known whether it was an accident or suicide.

<Keiichi>
"Meaning... for the last five years there's always one person who dies and one who goes missing...?"

<Ooishi>
"That's about right.
 No, actually, I'm surprised as well.
 I never realized they had that in common."
I couldn't believe that this could help lead to the closing of those incidents.
...It was just something they had in common.

<Keiichi>
"...Could it be... that those demoned away... have something in common?"
Ooishi-san mumbled as he seemed to be thinking about it.
So I summarized the events.

<Keiichi>
"The first year was the dam employee.
 Second year was the wife of a dam project supporter.
 Third year was the wife of the Shinto priest. 

<Keiichi>
Fourth year was the victim's family's child, and the fifth year was the victim's girlfriend... I guess.
 ...It doesn't seem like there's anything that connects them."

<Ooishi>
"With the exception of the first year... wives and girlfriends... those do stand out."
...It does seem like there are a lot.
Then that means... The fourth year's victim's child was different.
It would have really stood out if it were all married couples... except it's not just married couples, but parents and children as well.
...Come to think of it... I believe Tomitake-san also told me "The younger brother is alive and has moved," if I recall correctly.

<Keiichi>
"The child that went missing in the fourth year... who were they?"

<Ooishi>
"Apparently, he was quite mature.
 One year older than you.
 His name was Satoshi Houjou-san."

<Keiichi>
"...Huh? Satoshi...!?!?"
I remembered that name.
...Didn't they tell me Satoshi transferred out last year...!?

<Ooishi>
"He was at your school up until last year.
 Didn't they tell you anything about him?"
Come to think of it... when I transferred in, I believe they said my seat "belonged to a recent transfer student..."?
Then... where I sat...
 ...
Once belonged to the one who was demoned away.
 ...
It was his seat!?
I recalled the cold sensation that came from that desk... it made my hair stand on end...
This string of mysterious deaths...
 No, Oyashiro-sama's curse...
 I now knew how it connected to me.
That chilling sensation... it was the feeling of Oyashiro-sama caressing the back of my neck.

<Keiichi>
"...Oyashiro-sama's curse... huh?"
...Could Oyashiro-sama's curse... really exist?
In all honesty...
...I was beginning to believe it.
...And I was scared.
...That was why I wanted to say it was a plot crafted by man and not the work of a curse.
But... the more I dug into it, the less likely that seemed.
No... the more I dug, the more mysterious it became.
...If I kept digging... eventually...
 ...I'd reach the point where I'd learn something I really shouldn't know...
To either be none the wiser or to seek an answer I may regret...
 ...Which one would I be happier with?
Maybe... it'll be me next time.
...My execution could only be delayed for one year.
...That was when I remembered...
 Rena...
Rena said she may be the next victim of the curse.

<Ooishi>
"...You mean Rena Ryuugu-san?
 She transferred in last year and she's your classmate, isn't she?
 ...These incidents really might be a bit too disturbing for a girl.
 She's not just scared, is she?"
It wasn't that.
She said it might be her next.
She said it in a way that made me think she had a concrete reason behind it.

<Keiichi>
"...It felt like she was convinced.
 ...Almost as if... um, you could say..."
She was frightened.
Her sudden change in demeanor.
That someone who looked like Rena, but wasn't Rena...
...That might be unrelated.
All the strange things that I felt from Rena today came back to me.

<Ooishi>
"I see...
 Then I'll be doing a bit of investigating on this end.
 Please continue your observations of Ryuugu-san, Maebara-san."

<Keiichi>
"...Are you... asking me to keep Rena under surveillance?"

<Ooishi>
"That's not what I mean, Maebara-san.
 I just want you to watch out for your friend so she doesn't end up the next victim."
At that moment, just as my mouth was agape because I was so impressed with his mature, clever way with words...
Knock knock!
A sudden knock at the door sent my heart racing.
In an instant, I had pointlessly covered up the end of the receiver.

<Keiichi's dad>
"Keiichi~ Get the door, please~."
On the other side of the door, I heard my father's oddly upbeat voice.
 ...What could it be?
It's so late...

<Keiichi>
"Sorry, my dad just came in.
 ...Can we leave it at this for tonight?"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah.
 My apologies again for calling so late.
 ...If you find out anything else, please let me know.
 I'll tell you if I make any progress on this end.
 Well then, have a pleasant evening."

<Keiichi's dad>
"Keiichi~ hurry and open up~
 Daddy's got his hands full."
What is Dad doing...?
I had stayed in the same position while on the phone the whole time, so my joints were aching.
When I opened the door, I saw my father was standing there with a tray.
On that tray, cookies and two cups of black tea. A fairly fancy spread for our household.
There was even sugar and lemon slices on the side. Everything you could ask for.
...This was quite the show of hospitality.

<Keiichi>
"Wh-What's going on, Dad?
 ...What's all this for??"

<Keiichi's dad>
"Come, now. Don't play around, Keiichi~
 I'm coming in~."
Dad was in high spirits and had a smirk on his face.
But... for my entire life, I've never seen him act this hospitable.
...What had gotten into him?

<Keiichi's dad>
"So... what were you talking about?"
I jumped.
...It's not something I had to keep from my father...
 But how could I explain to him I was talking to a detective (I'm assuming he was) this late at night?

<Keiichi>
"N-N-Nothing much...
 Just a friend...!"

<Keiichi's dad>
"I don't mean the phone.
 She was here, wasn't she?
 Rena-chan."

?

<Keiichi>
"...She wasn't here."

<Keiichi's dad>
"Come now! Don't try to keep it from me~!
 She just came over to play.
 You two were chatting away, so I thought I'd bring some tea, but looks like I just missed her."
I had no idea what Dad was talking about.
...But a cold sweat dripped down my back.

<Keiichi>
"H... How long were we talking...?"

<Keiichi's dad>
"Rena-chan went upstairs about half after... so it was close to an hour, I guess?"

<Keiichi>
"You saw her... come up to the second floor?"

<Keiichi's dad>
"Yeah, I did.
 I also told her that your room was the door down the hall up the stairs."
Rena came to my house about an hour ago.
 ...Dad met her at the door... and called out to me on the second floor.
(I probably didn't hear him because I was so focused on my conversation with Ooishi-san...)
I didn't reply, but he knew I was in my room, so he had her come inside.
...Then told her my room was on the second floor.
...She thanked my dad and went upstairs...
Then about an hour passed.
...She passed by my dad just as he was bringing up tea and left.
She came upstairs and about an hour passed.
Then passed by my dad and returned home.
Th... Then... after she came upstairs... and until she left... where was... Rena...?

There's only a short hallway... between my room and the stairs.
Meaning...
 Rena had...
 For about an hour...
 ..In the hall...
 ...No... she couldn't have been standing in front of my door all that time...
The door to my room wasn't particularly thick.
You could easily hear everything being said inside.
...All of the unsettling and unguarded things I spoke to Ooishi-san about began rushing through my head...

<Keiichi's mom>
"Honey, don't tease him.
 ...More importantly, you need to clean up your studio.
 It's a mess again."
Mom yelled up at Dad from downstairs.
Dad left the tray with me and went downstairs with a disappointed chortle.
I followed my dad out of the room with my eyes... I looked down at the floor around the doorway where Rena might have stood all that time.
Just now... as I was talking to Ooishi-san... With my back turned, Rena was standing a mere six feet away... the whole time...?
All that time... in this dimly lit doorway...?
What did she see?
What did she hear?
For what reason?
As the steam from the two teacups ominously wafted and twisted... the aroma of black tea filled my room...



[Onikakushi Ch.10]

Weariness and a headache.
Not a very nice way to start the day...

<Keiichi's mom>
"What's wrong?
 Keiichi.
 ...You don't look so well.
 When did you go to sleep?"
It seemed that my mom had noticed my sullen state.
...Yesterday... I kept on waking up in the middle of the night.
Without a doubt, I felt a presence.
...I felt the presence of someone standing in front of my door.
I told myself repeatedly that it was my imagination and forced myself to try and sleep.
Except... not being able to stand it, I gathered up my courage and opened the door.
...Of course there wasn't anyone there.
I think I did this three times throughout the night.
...Or maybe I just didn't remember doing it any more than that...
Even though I was able to get to the breakfast table without incident, I still didn't feel at ease.

<Keiichi>
"It might be a cold.
 ...I don't really have an appetite."

<Keiichi's mom>
"...My.
 ...You do seem a little warm...
 Well?
 Can you make it to school?"
Technically I did go to a school... but it was mostly self study.
 ...It wouldn't matter much if I missed a day, would it?
It could have been that I hadn't been feeling well for the last few days because I really did have a cold.
If I took some medicine and got a good day of rest... I might be able to greet everyone with a smile tomorrow.
Ding dong...!

Startled, I looked back and forth between the entrance and the clock.
...It was ten minutes later than when I usually met up with Rena.
 ...It was Rena.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Rena-chan came to get you... what are you going to do?
 Are you going to take the day off?"
...Rena was a good girl.
 She might be somewhat quirky, but she was certainly cute.
 The lunches she made were delicious and she always looked out for me.
...Why should I be so scared of something like that...?
It wasn't Rena's fault.
It was probably mine...
It had to have been my cold.
 ...It just had to be.

<Keiichi>
"I'll rest.
 ...Sorry."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Then I'll go send her off for you."
Mom headed off to the door.
...I would have to pass by the entrance to get back to my room.
I didn't have the nerve to meet with Rena... so I wrapped myself in a blanket on the sofa and closed my eyes.
I was so sleep-deprived, I quickly fell into a deep slumber...
I had only intended to lie down for a bit, but it was almost noon when I woke up.
I called out to my parents, but they didn't seem to be around. On the table, I found lunch prepared and a note.
Mom and Dad had apparently driven off to somewhere far away.
It likely had to do with Dad's work.
This happened every so often, so it wasn't that unusual.
They would be back for dinner, but might be a bit late.
On the note, it said:
"The insurance card is in the cabinet. Take it and go to the hospital."
There was also a well-drawn map to the hospital.
...That's right.
 I hadn't been there before, so I didn't know exactly where it was.
I had a light lunch... although it really was just leftovers from the morning... and, just in case, went to the hospital.
Normally I'd never be here... in the middle of a weekday.
 ...Just walking around like this had me feeling guilty. It was an odd feeling.
Following my mom's map, I took a road I usually never used. After walking for a bit, the hospital's sign came into view.
"Irie Clinic" was written rather stylishly on the sign.
The clinic wasn't very big, but based on the scale of the rest of Hinamizawa, it was far too grand.
There was a parking lot and even a reserved spot for buses.
 ...They must be making a mint.
I spaced out in the air-conditioned waiting room until it was my turn to be seen...

<Nurse>
"Maebara-san, please make your way to the examination room."
After half-heartedly answering all of the chatty doctor's questions, he responded with the old "it's probably a cold."
They gave me a shot and three days worth of medicine.
...I thought it was a little overboard, but if it would clear away the gloomy feeling I'd been having lately, then it was worth it.
I settled the bill and took a quick trip to the washroom. As I was leaving, I overheard a conversation between some elderly people who seemed to be regulars at the clinic.
Of course, I had no intention of eavesdropping.
 ...If it just wasn't for that word...

<Villager>
"...must have been an Onikakushi."

<Villager>
"I wonder...
 She was still pretty young,
 might've just eloped."

<Villager>
"With whom?"

<Villager>
"That man from Tokyo who visits every season.
 That young one with that big camera.
 Didn't you know they were getting along pretty well?"
...Were they talking about Tomitake-san!?
I could feel my ears perking up.

<Villager>
"I don't know about that...
 But... you have to make preparations before you elope.
 Leave a note or quit their job or something."

<Villager>
"It's an elopement because they didn't leave a note or message."

<Villager>
"...The thought that I'll never see that young nurse's face again makes me rather sad..."

<Villager>
"Takano-san is an upstanding young woman.
 ...She'll be fine wherever she goes."
So her name was Takano-san?
 ...That woman with Tomitake-san.
 And... she worked at this clinic...!?
Oyashiro-sama's shadow was following me everywhere I went.
I started listening more closely, but they began talking about fishing and it didn't seem like they were going to revisit the topic. I gave up and left.
Thus, even though I was separated from the daily monotony of school, I wasn't able to escape from Oyashiro-sama's shadow.
...But of course.
Oyashiro-sama was the guardian deity of this place...
 of Hinamizawa.
As long as I was in Hinamizawa, I wouldn't be able to escape...
Maybe it was because I was walking outside, but my appetite had suddenly returned.
I might as well buy a snack with the change from the examination fee on the way home.
Contemplating that, I turned onto a familiar street.
At that moment, I heard a car horn abruptly honk behind me.
...Was I really walking so far into the middle of the road where I'd be in a car's way?
I moved farther off to the side, but the horn was still honking at me. I turned around, peeved.

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san,
 good day to you."
It was Ooishi-san.
 He stepped out of his car, AC on full blast, and waved at me.

<Ooishi>
"What's up today?
 School on break?"

<Keiichi>
"J-Just not feeling well, so I took the day off.
 ...I was about to buy lunch and head back home."

<Ooishi>
"That's great.
 I'm just about to get lunch myself.  Would you mind going together?
 ...Ah, if you're not feeling up for it, then don't mind me."
I was just going to lie down after going home anyway.
...And I didn't really have a cold.

<Ooishi>
"I expect you'd rather avoid using one of the local places.
 Let's go into town.
 It's a bit of a drive, is that all right?
 I know a pretty good place."
I'd finally begun to understand Ooishi-san's roundabout way of saying things.
...He probably wanted to talk to me about stuff that would be difficult to discuss while in Hinamizawa.
I went with Ooishi-san, riding in his frigid car.
It was almost as if the bright sunlight outside was a lie.

<Ooishi>
"I'm sorry about calling you so late last night.
 Did your parents get angry at you?"

<Keiichi>
"No..."
I recalled Rena, who had been listening to the phone conversation all that time, separated from me by just the door.
...Even now, in the brightness of the sunlight... the thought still creeped me out.
With a big bump that jolted the car, the road connecting to the city changed from dirt to pavement.
My head swiveled back with a sudden realization.
 That's right...
 This was where Tomitake-san died.

<Ooishi>
"...They've hit a snag on the investigation regarding Tomitake-san."
Ooishi-san spoke while peering at me from the corner of his eye.

<Ooishi>
"They believed it was caused by hallucinogens, given how he was clawing out his own throat
 ...But a drug that could cause that to happen so suddenly... is extremely hard to come by.

<Ooishi>
Bear in mind, of course, the autopsy was done with that premise in mind... but we didn't find any leads."

<Keiichi>
"Um... you know that thing you see in comics all the time?
 Where there's a drug that doesn't leave any traces after being consumed..."

<Ooishi>
"It exists.
 Succinylchol-something-or-other.
 Well, it's pretty common.

<Ooishi>
But you see. There doesn't seem to be any kind of drug that would cause Tomitake-san to react like that."

<Keiichi>
"...Then... you're saying the police concluded Tomitake-san just died from the curse!?"
I couldn't help but feel that the police were worthless.
...I just wanted the idea of a curse to be dissociated from Tomitake-san's mysterious death.

<Ooishi>
"Unfortunately, that's how it looks right now.
 But putting aside the cause of death... Without a doubt, he was surrounded by a group of people and had taken a beating before he died. 

<Ooishi>
That was no curse, but an incident that unquestionably involved other humans."
That made me a bit.. relieved.
We passed in front of the rather desolate (but still busier than Hinamizawa) train station.
The car pulled into a restaurant parking lot and I followed Ooishi-san into the shop.
It was pretty crowded, but there were only adults at this hour. Of course there wouldn't be children in here in the middle of a weekday.

<Ooishi>
"Two, please. I'll... make do with non-smoking."

<Waitress>
"This way, please.
 When you are ready to order, please call me over."
We were led by a peculiarly dressed waitress to our table. I sat with Ooishi-san in the booth.

<Ooishi>
"So what do you think?
 Aren't the waitresses' outfits here cute?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 Well... um... I guess??"

<Ooishi>
"...This shop is always quite busy.
 It's more about the waitresses than the food, you see~."

<Keiichi>
"Uh huh.
 ...Ooishi-san... you're leering."

<Ooishi>
"Hmm?
 Am I really?
 Murhuhuhuhuh...!"
...Regardless of how the waitresses looked, the food was decent enough...
Finishing our meals while talking about some inane topic, Ooishi-san's after-meal cup of coffee arrived at the table.

<Ooishi>
"Yesterday, we talked about Hinamizawa's past, didn't we?"

<Keiichi>
"Yeah. That it was the village of man-eating demons... or something like that."

<Ooishi>
"I didn't know much about it myself, so I asked my grandmother about it this morning."
Ooishi-san took out the notepad that was stuffed into his breast pocket.

<Ooishi>
"Turns out that Hinamizawa used to be called Onigafuchi—the Demon's Abyss."

<Keiichi>
"Onigafuchi...
 ...That's quite the name..."

<Ooishi>
"The name is still around.
 ...The swamp where the Shinto priest's wife drowned herself is still called Onigafuchi.
 ...It's said that the depths of that swamp connect to the realm of demons."
Of course, nobody had told me anything about such an ominous swamp...

<Ooishi>
"And you see,
 it appears they were both feared and revered."
A respect born of fear...
 I guess you could say it was a kind of deification.
A village of inhuman creatures.

<Ooishi>
"Seems the demons were Sennin—or mountain-dwelling mystics—of sorts.

<Ooishi>
Villagers with incurable illnesses would be taken to Onigafuchi to be healed, for example."
Even if we are calling them demons... Tengu—long-nosed goblins—or Sennin would be a more apt description.

<Keiichi>
"They don't seem like such terrible people, even though they were called demons."

<Ooishi>
"But they were still man-eating demons.
 According to the story my grandma told me... as payment for treating the son's illness, 'Let us eat the mother who brought him here!'
 ...Was apparently how things went."

<Keiichi>
"...The price of curing her son... was herself!?
 ...That's unsettling."

<Ooishi>
"Of course the mother took her son and ran.
 Then, you see...
 All the villagers of Onigafuchi -
the demons- chased, surrounded, and captured them."
The entire village...
 apparently.
...That's quite a frightening thing to imagine.

<Ooishi>
"In the end, it seems both the mother and son were caught and eaten.
 The end."

<Keiichi>
"There's a problem with this story.
 ...Both witnesses in this story were eaten, so nobody would be able to tell the tale."

<Ooishi>
"Huuh?
 ...Bwahahaha! There are plenty of old fables like this."
In contrast to the ghastly tale, Ooishi-san laughed heartily while sipping his coffee.

<Ooishi>
"But, well...
 ...There are quite a few other tales.
 Where the demons from Onigafuchi band together to capture their prey."
I recalled that Mion said all the villagers united and fought against the dam construction.
...I saw similarities with how that part about unification overlapped.

<Ooishi>
"They would always hunt down a single person, and they chose who it was going to be beforehand."

<Keiichi>
"...Huh?"
That caught my attention.
...Ooishi-san also appeared to be pondering what it meant.

<Ooishi>
"My grandmother told me that you must never interfere with the 'demon's hunt.'
 You should just hole up in your house and hide under the covers, she said."

<Keiichi>
"...So what does this all mean?"

<Ooishi>
"It means you mustn't ever help or protect the prey.
 As long as you don't disturb the demon's hunt, no harm will fall upon the villagers.
 It seems there's that kind of rule."
Basically... don't help the victims.
Pretend you didn't see the atrocities... in other words...

<Keiichi>
"What happens if you break the rule?"

<Ooishi>
"Well...
 they're man-eating demons, after all..."
Many parts of that tale caught my attention.
...Parts of the story he told me overlapped with his theory that the entire village was in on the crime.
Even if it wasn't the whole village... it was conceivable that the villagers were "hiding under the covers and leaving them to die" when there's a group that was on their 'hunt,' wasn't it...???
I didn't dare speak it.

<Keiichi>
"...Then, Ooishi-san... I guess it looks like it's either the entire village or a group of villagers perpetrating the crimes...?"

<Ooishi>
"What do you think, Maebara-san?
 ...Ah, excuse me.
 Another cup of coffee, please."
That's what I wanted to know.
...It seemed that... we were both waiting for the other to say that last part...
He waited for the waitress to finish pouring coffee before speaking.

<Ooishi>
"...Last year, I had a nagging feeling when Satoshi-kun disappeared."
Ooishi-san muttered as he watched the milk swirl around in his coffee.

<Ooishi>
"So those friends of Satoshi-san... meaning your group of friends, Maebara-san... I had a bit—
 Really just a little bit, okay?
 —of background checking done on them."
If Ooishi-san had said this to me before... I would've gotten angry at him for calling my friends into question...
 But as I was now, I couldn't...

<Ooishi>
"This might sound pretty stupid.
 Maebara-san, if you feel that it's stupid, please say so.
 I'll just stop."
Ooishi-san was wearing the most serious expression that I'd ever seen from him.
...It was as if he was telling me to prepare myself and listen.
There were quite a few things I regretted hearing from Ooishi-san.
...But... none of them were as threatening as this...
A little voice inside me was screaming like an alarm...!
Stop, Keiichi.
 This was probably the last one...!
I took a deep breath and silenced that voice.
...I would not run from the truth.

<Keiichi>
"...Please."
That was all I could utter.
...Ooishi-san stared into my eyes silently for a few moments. After he was certain I was ready, he began.

<Ooishi>
"The victim of the incident in the first year was the overseer. A few weeks prior, he had an altercation with Mion Sonozaki-san.
 Multiple altercations."
...Ooishi-san had said before that Mion had defied the dam project vehemently.
...Well, it wasn't hard to imagine how she'd be if she got worked up.

<Ooishi>
"In the second year, the married couple who supported the project died in that accident, right?
 Their daughter was with them at the time...
 Her name is Satoko Houjou-san."

<Keiichi>
"Huh!?
 Satoko, meaning...
 Satoko!?!?"
Ooishi-san's look told me that my voice was too loud.
 ...I realized it as well, and quickly quieted down.

<Ooishi>
"The Shinto priest and his wife who died in the third year. You see...
 their daughter is Rika Furude-san."

<Keiichi>
"...Rika-chan...was--!?!?"

<Ooishi>
"The housewife who died in the fourth year you know already, don't you?
 It was the step-aunt of Satoko Houjou-san.
 ...She was in her aunt and uncle's custody, as she had lost both of her parents in the accident... 

<Ooishi>
She lived in the victim's house."
I could tell my lips were getting dry.
I... didn't even have the wits to keep my mouth from hanging agape.
I had thought it was nothing but a bizarre incident... one that I could easily distance myself from.
...But, clicking and clacking... it had snuck all the way to my feet...

<Ooishi>
"The one who disappeared the fourth year, by the way... he was Satoko-san's older brother."

<Keiichi>
"Wha... just... ah... wait... just a second..."
It took everything I had to finally say that.
...I gulped down a glass of water and once again wiped my face with a napkin...
Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...!
But Ooishi-san was relentless.
...Instead of waiting for me to finish sorting out my feelings, he started speaking again.
The last of the things I shouldn't have heard...

<Ooishi>
"All of the victims seem to be connected to your group of friends."


<Keiichi>
"...That has to be just a coincidence!!"

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san, keep it down...
 Everyone's looking..."
Mion...?
 Satoko!?
 Rika-chan!?
So what if they're connected!?
You're telling me, all of my friends...!?!?
It couldn't be... it just couldn't be...
 ...Oh, Rena is different, isn't she!?
Rena isn't connected with the victims at all.

<Ooishi>
"Rena Ryuugu-san was living in a suburb of Ibaraki prefecture up until last year.
 Well, it's true she hadn't directly met any of the victims..."
He said it in a roundabout way.
Is he saying she's also connected...!?

<Ooishi>
"Actually, I looked into her. Before Ryuugu-san moved away to Hinamizawa, she was suspended from school.
 It seems she went through her school building and broke all of the windows."

<Keiichi>
"R-Rena did that!?
 ...She broke all the windows at her school!?!?"
That... same, spacey... Rena had...!?
I couldn't even imagine it.

<Ooishi>
"It seems that, after her three day suspension, she didn't return to school.
 She went to a neurologist and was given weeks of counseling and medication."
I wonder if it was something like a nervous breakdown.
... I'd heard that it happens to people who are really methodical or overly sensitive.
...Neither of those matched Rena's easygoing personality...

<Ooishi>
"...and in the counselor's medical report, he recorded all of the conversations he had with Rena-san...
 'It' shows up...
 And quite a bit at that."

<Keiichi>
"What did...?"
I pressed forward carelessly.
...There couldn't be anything more for me to regret...

<Ooishi>
"She mentioned...
 the word, 'Oyashiro-sama.'"

It felt like someone's stone cold hand was caressing my back...
...Why... why had Rena spoken of Oyashiro-sama before she even came to Hinamizawa...!?

<Ooishi>
"Seems that the Oyashiro-sama she spoke of was like a ghost, appearing in her house every night.
 Standing over her pillow, looking down at her."
...My mind froze.
...I couldn't process... what I was being told...

<Ooishi>
"A while after that, she moved to Hinamizawa.
 ...Ah, that's right.
 She's not an outsider."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?"

<Ooishi>
"According to their residency register, the Ryuugu family used to reside in Hinamizawa.
 They moved to Ibaraki just as Rena-san entered elementary school."
My mind went completely blank...
...It was similar to the static you'd see on a blank TV channel...
My ears began ringing as I lost all sense of comprehension...

<Ooishi>
"...Maebara-san, are you all right?
 Shall we stop?"
Those words brought me back.
 ...I couldn't let it end here...!

<Keiichi>
"...Now I know about Rena...
 Then... how about the last victim, Tomitake-san?
 ...Who was he connected with...?"
Irritated, I let out one final reprisal.

<Ooishi>
"...All of them.
 Have you forgotten, Maebara-san?
 Didn't you all spend the night of the festival together quite merrily?
 Quite a few of the officers saw you enjoying yourselves."
...Now there was nothing I could respond with...
...I fell silent as my brain turned to mush...

<Ooishi>
"We should get going.
 Ah, Maebara-san, did you take your afternoon medicine?"
I had completely forgotten about the medicine I had gotten today until Ooishi-san said that...
I got another glass of water, and we left the shop after I chugged it down.
We got in the car and returned to Hinamizawa via the rough road.
...I never really paid attention when I was on my bike, but did cars normally shake this much...?
...It was almost as if the road was desperately trying to tell me something.
*Badump*

...That big jolt was from the difference in elevation of the road when it changed from cement to dirt.
I was certain that I heard Tomitake-san's scream...
I sat in silence, just letting myself be shaken by the car...

<Ooishi>
"I'll drop you off at your house.
 ...You missed school because you were ill, correct?
 My apologies for the long conversation."

<Keiichi>
"...Why did you talk to me?"
 I blurted out the question.
...Really just blurted it out.
 I didn't expect an answer.

<Ooishi>
"I did check with you first, didn't I?
 If we should just stop..."

<Keiichi>
"Not that!
 ...Why did you reach out to me?"
...I understood quite well that Ooishi-san was investigating this string of suspicious incidents.
But... why was he telling me all this...?
I knew nothing and I couldn't help.
 Everything Ooishi-san spoke of was news to me.
...First of all... what could I, having just moved here, possibly know?
By chance... If there was a reason for Ooishi-san to reach out to me, then it would have to be...
...That I was part of Mion's circle of friends, who looked suspicious to Ooishi-san...

<Ooishi>
"...I'm retiring this year.
 I plan on moving away after retiring as my grandma wants.
 So while I'm still on the case, I want to bring the truth behind this incident to light."

<Keiichi>
"...So... Ooishi-san, you suspect them, don't you?
 All of them."
Ooishi-san didn't really give a response.
It felt a little late, but I thought it was his way of showing a bit of consideration for my feelings.

<Ooishi>
"This is... mostly my intuition from 30 years on this job.
 ...Maebara-san. You're the one in danger."

<Keiichi>
"...Huh?"
I wanted to reply with "that's absurd!," but in my downtrodden state I couldn't bring myself to say it.

<Ooishi>
"I'll be retiring this year, so I won't be at the Watanagashi next year.
 ...So I want to settle things."
In other words, he was insinuating that on the next Watanagashi, I might be the victim...

<Ooishi>
"I've been warned by the chief as well.
 'Each incident in the string of cases has been solved, so don't bring it up again,' or so I was told...
 This is the pressure that I'm facing..."

<Keiichi>
"Pressure... from what?"

<Ooishi>
"Someone in Hinamizawa.
 ...We've arrived.
 Is this fine?"
After some time, the car finally reached the path to my house.
 The clock read 2pm.
 ...I was surprised so little time had passed since we ate.
It was hot outside the car.
 The chirping of the higurashi hurt my ears.

<Ooishi>
"I won't mind if you just forgot everything I told you today.
 ...But I'm still going to keep investigating.
 I'll end Oyashiro-sama's curse this year."

<Keiichi>
"...So you're saying I should contact you if anything happens?"

<Ooishi>
"It's fine.
 ...Just contact me when you feel you have to, Maebara-san."
I wasn't collected enough to understand Ooishi-san's roundabout way of saying it.

<Ooishi>
"Be sure to take it easy.
 ...I'm sorry for throwing all this at you while you're taking the day off because you're sick."
I didn't really give any sort of response.

<Ooishi>
"I'll always be on your side.
 ...If anything, believe that.
 I'll be off now."
The tires crunched over the dirt road as the car made a U-turn and disappeared into a cloud of kicked-up dust.
It felt like I was watching a boat only throw me a lifesaver in shark-infested waters before disappearing into the distance.
...That was the first time I thought Ooishi-san was being unfair.
Telling me I was going to be the next victim, then just saying to contact him if something happened.
...This wasn't a criminal investigation.
He was fishing.
...And I was just the bait dangling off the line.
Would the fish be the perpetrator?
 Or was it really just Oyashiro-sama's curse?
...Either way, the bait would be swallowed whole...

<Keiichi>
"...Damn it... I don't want to die..."
For some time, I could do nothing but stare at the puddle of water left behind by the AC from the car...
I wonder how much time had passed since I laid down.
It was getting dark outside.
My body was soaked in sweat.
 ...It would probably be a good idea to change my sheets.
At that moment, the phone downstairs rang.
It was probably Mom.
Mom was quite the worrywart.
 ...Maybe she had called many times but I just didn't notice it...

<Keiichi>
"Hello, this is the Maebara residence."

<Mion>
"Oh, he's alive! Hello!
 This is Mion.
 How you doing~?"

<Keiichi>
"Hm, is this one of Keiichi's friends?
 Keiichi is resting now, but...
 shall I put him on?"

<Mion>
"Huh!?
 I-I-Is this his dad??
 Ahahahaha, s-s-sorry!!"

<Keiichi>
"Bwahahahahahahahaha!!
 Idiot~!
 You fell for it!"

<Mion>
"Huh!?
 K-Kei-chaaaaAAAaaaaaAAan!!"
After our exchange, we both had a good laugh together.
...Except I was suspicious of her even as we were laughing...
...Was everybody... really involved in the incidents...?
...The fact that I couldn't say "no," saddened me.

<Mion>
"I'm relieved that you seem well.
 Rena was really worried, you know?
 Satoko-chan was happy and said you got what you deserved!
 Rika-chan said, 'how unfortunate he's sick!'"

<Keiichi>
"Heh, looks like everyone was making a big deal out of it!"

<Mion>
"Well, you know. So Kei-chan...
 Is now a bad time to come pay you a visit?"

<Keiichi>
"A visit?
 No, it's okay. It's not like I'm dying."

<Mion>
"My grandma made a ton of mochi, you see.
 I was told to share them.
 So I'll bring you some!"

<Keiichi>
"...Hey now, you'll catch my cold."

<Mion>
"Not to worry! Both Rena and I are too stupid to catch a cold!
 See you!
 Be there in a bit!"
She hung up cheerfully.
Rena's coming too?
That's what it sounded like.
...I was still concerned about meeting Rena, but I guess if she was with Mion...
I heard the doorbell ten minutes later.

<Mion>
"How are you feeling?
 Did you take your medicine and rest~?"

<Keiichi>
"I did just that."

<Rena>
"Th-Thank goodness you look well. I was worried..."

<Keiichi>
"Sorry... I'll be fine by tomorrow."
Mion showed a complete lack of concern for someone who's recovering, and Rena looked like she was worried about me from the bottom of her heart.
...It didn't look like there was anything behind those expressions.

<Mion>
"...I thought we might hang out for a bit, but it looks like you're not quite in the condition for it."

<Keiichi>
"Hm? Y-You don't say!?"
It seemed my face appeared a bit sullen.

<Rena>
"...Then here, Keiichi-kun.
 ...These are the mochi Mii-chan's grandma made."
Rena held out the package wrapped in newspaper.
There might be about five in here.
...It was quite hefty.

<Keiichi>
"Ah, thanks. Send my regards to your grandma, Mion."

<Rena>
"Yep.
 Ah, there's one that I made in there as well!
 I wonder if Keiichi-kun can guess which one..."

<Mion>
"This is Kei-chan's homework since he missed the club meeting today!
 There are letters on each mochi, so I'll ask you tomorrow!"

<Keiichi>
"W-Were you checking if I was feeling better or did you just come here for club activities!?!"

<Mion>
"Yep, yep, looking fine. Guess you'll be able to make it tomorrow~."

<Keiichi>
"Man, what are you going to do if my fever comes back because of your shenanigans?"

<Rena>
"M-Mii-chan, we shouldn't be making such a racket...
 Let's go.
 The other people here will get angry."
...Both of them thought my parents were home.
It was because the entranceway was a mess.

<Mion>
"You're right, let's get going.
 ...Ah, by the way, Kei-chan."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah?"

<Mion>
"What did you eat for lunch?"
The sudden question startled me and I went wide-eyed when I saw Mion.
...I had never seen her like that... it was a highly unsettling visage.
But... why... is she asking me about what I ate for lunch...?
What she said was so inane it was almost meaningless.
...The way she said it, it was almost like she didn't even care at all about what I ate.

<Keiichi>
"I-I ate out..."
...She must have suspected that I was with Ooishi-san...
Anyway, I felt that if I hesitated or tried to change the subject then they'd read too deep into it... so I tried answering as quickly as possible.
Except... contrary to the efforts I had made... there was a pause before they replied.

<Rena>
"...Hmm, so you ate out for lunch, Keiichi-kun."
The glimmer from Rena's eyes had changed at some point, as well.
...It was now sharp... as if to make me feel the feigned ignorance behind her words even more.
...As if she already knew... that's how it looked to me.

<Mion>
"Well? Was it good?"

<Keiichi>
"...Wh-Why are you asking me this...?"
Mion was speaking in an unusually low tone.
...Almost as if... she knew that I had eaten at the restaurant in town...
No... I'm overthinking this.
...I mean... both of them should have been in school at lunchtime.
...There was no way they could have known where I was...

<Mion>
"Seems you were with a rather austere-looking older guy.
 ...Who was he?"
Flop.
The package with the mochi I was holding slipped out of my hands.
I could tell the blood had drained from my face, making me go pale.

<Rena>
"...Oh?
 Keiichi-kun, who was he?
 ...Could it be the person from before, I wonder?
 ...I wonder!?"
I could feel the back of my throat going dry...
This was no longer a bluff.
...They... knew everything...!?

<Keiichi>
"H... How... do you... know that...?"
It took everything I had to finally force those words from my throat.
...My knees were shaking.

<Mion>
"...Because...
 ...there's nothing this old man doesn't know."
...Mion sneered knowingly... and her laugh seemed to carry on forever.

<Mion>
"So, Kei-chan, what did you talk about?
 It seems like you got pretty worked up over it, too..."

<Keiichi>
"W-We weren't talking about you guys...!
 It didn't have anything to do with you or Rena...!"

<Rena>
"Hmm?
 ...Isn't it a bit strange to hear our names come up even though nobody asked about that, hmmm?"
Rena's unwavering gaze pierced through my eyes and peered further inside me.
I'd dug my own grave.
 ...My heart was throbbing so much, it felt like it was going to explode...

<Mion>
"Well, whatever you're trying to hide... This old man already sees through it all.
 Remember that."

<Keiichi>
"..."
I couldn't even shake my head.
...It took everything I had to stop my teeth from chattering...
She never let her gaze break from mine, even as she tilted her head slightly.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun, you don't look so good.
 I think you should lie down."

<Mion>
"That's true. We should both head back home."
As if nothing had happened, they both giggled at each other and started making their way out.
I hadn't moved a muscle since I had dropped the package of mochi.
As they left, the door slowly closed behind them.
...All I could do was stare.
 ...As if I couldn't move until the door was completely closed.
Just as the door was just about closed, it opened again slightly with a sudden creak, sending my heart racing once again.
A single eye peered in through that narrow slit, and Mion's hawkish gaze peered at me once again.

<Mion>
"See you, Kei-chan."

<Keiichi>
"...Y... Yeah..."

<Mion>
"...I'd 'hate it' if you missed school tomorrow, alright?"
Thud.
...The door closed.
I wasn't able to move a muscle even after their low laughter died off into the distance and silence once again enveloped the room...
Coming back to my senses, the first thing I did was lock the door...
They knew what Ooishi-san and I talked about...!?
Why...!?
 How!?
No... that wasn't important...
Thinking about it now... All of it could have been overheard... from the beginning when Ooishi-san met me.
 ...Just as Mion said... I couldn't hide anything...
Then... what were they... trying to tell me...?
...That part was obvious.
They were warning me not to say anything 'unnecessary.'
What did they deem unnecessary...?
I only talked with Ooishi-san about one thing.
 ...And they were warning me that that was unnecessary.
What was it that Ooishi-san talked to me about...?
 The incidents involving Oyashiro-sama's curse that occurred every year weren't individual cases...
 but were connected as a whole...
 As well as the fact that there may be multiple perpetrators hidden within Hinamizawa...
No... more precisely...
...that Mion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika-chan were all suspicious.
Is that what they are warning me against...?

<Keiichi>
"Wh... What kind of nonsense am I thinking about!?"
I hit my own face hard enough that it let out a loud slap.
...If only that would wake me from this nightmare... But for some reason it felt like I was punching a blanket... it was almost laughably painless.
Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...!
When did I become such a pessimist?
Calm down. Calm down!
Settle down and sort things out...!
The reason Mion knew I was eating lunch with Ooishi-san was probably because... somebody from Hinamizawa just happened to be there at the time.
They must have told Mion that I was there...
That made the most sense.
Plus... come to think of it... She didn't ask me where I ate lunch, did she?
...She only asked, "was it good?"...!
They were just curious since I was together with someone not from Hinamizawa... It's not... as if they had any ulterior motives...
 That's it. That has to be it...!
Thinking about it that way, it was the same with Rena.
I was just being strangely ambiguous about when I met with Ooishi-san, and Rena was just correcting me on that.
That's when I was bewildered by the change in character from the usual mild-mannered Rena... and was just startled by it...
 That's the most natural way of thinking about it...!
...It felt like my mind was mixed up like a tangled mess of spaghetti.
...Deep red marinara sauce would have poured out of my nose and ears if you squeezed my head.
Thinking that, I suddenly felt like vomiting.
...I really didn't want that to happen, so I stopped holding my head...
Lately, I had no idea what anyone was saying...
Spending time with them was fun.
 It didn't feel like there was any sort of hidden agenda.
 I really do think that they're a good bunch of people...
When I just moved here and couldn't make heads or tails of everything, they were really kind to me.
Rena was really kind and always looked after me.
 As long as that strange affliction didn't rear its ugly head, she was really pretty cute.
Mion is also a really good person.
 She didn't care about anyone's age or gender, and was optimistic and outgoing.
 I was never bored when I was with her.
...And talking of not getting bored, rambunctious Satoko was a good person for that, too.
 She was pretty bratty, but that was just the way she interacted with others.
...Rika-chan was the same way.
 She didn't speak often, but that didn't mean she was always silent.
 ...They're my friends!
...But... after hearing of the better untold secrets of Hinamizawa from Ooishi-san and Tomitake-san... when I was told about Oyashiro-sama's curse... things started going crazy.
Then hearing from Ooishi-san... that Mion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika-chan were all suspicious.
...After that... everyone changed.
...That's right.
It all started getting weird after Ooishi-san told me all that strange stuff...
...At that time, I really should have... should have just not listened to those weird stories.
...I shouldn't even have asked Tomitake-san about the past incidents on the night of the Watanagashi...
...If I just hadn't gotten that strange sense of curiosity... if I just hadn't...
That's right...
 So that's why they ****ed Tomitake-san.
 That impudent outsider speaking to the likes of me after everybody went out of their way to keep it a secret from me.
They'll probably **** Ooishi-san as well.
 For trying to unearth what everybody was warning me was better left buried.
 Besides that... he was unforgivable for spewing words that made me doubt the others. 
...Of course a guy like that is going to be ****ed...!!!
Both Tomitake-san and Ooishi-san were nothing but outsiders, after all.
 They were entities who couldn't coexist with the people of Hinamizawa.
 Those guys should just fall to Oyashiro-sama's curse and just ***!!
It wasn't their fault.
...It was my fault for not being able to hold back my curiosity.
It wasn't their fault.
It wasn't their fault...
Itwasn'ttheirfaultitwasn'ttheirfaultitwasn'ttheirfault.
I settled into a daze... it was a lethargic feeling like I had just gotten up, but the ominous chill that haunted me had subsided.
 ...I was fine now.
 ...I was no longer frightened.
 ...I had completely recovered.
I'll go to school tomorrow, right as rain.
 I'll greet everyone.
 I'll take part in club activities.
 It'll definitely be fun.
 It had to be fun.
...I was one of them, after all.

<Keiichi>
"...Ah, that reminds me. I need to eat those mochi...
 I hope I'm able to tell which one Rena made."
I remembered the homework the two brought with them when they visited me.
But wow, our club did delivery. That was something else.
I picked up the package I'd dropped on the floor and headed into the living room.
It would be nice, I guess, to have some tea with it.
...To fill my mouth with mochi while drinking tea.
 ...Oh.
 This was quite a delectable situation I was in.
Opening up the newspaper wrapping, there were five plump red bean paste mochi fit snugly inside.
There were letters written from left to right on the newspaper: A, B, C, D, and E.
Now, then...
 They said Rena made one of these... I wonder which one.
There wasn't much difference in how they looked.
They smelled and appeared about the same.
 ...This was... a pretty difficult problem!
The biggest difference... was probably their shape.
I wasn't sure what kind of person Mion's grandma was, but Rena's had to be different from hers...!
Looking carefully, I could see one mochi that was made very neatly.
So well that, just by staring at it, one could tell it stood out.

<Keiichi>
"...Looks like this challenge depends on whether or not this one is Rena's."
Calm down and think even harder...!
...Mion had said her grandma made a ton of them and was told to give some out, if I remembered correctly.
...So that meant four of these were from that large batch.
Then what about Rena?
She probably... only made one.
So she probably spent quite a bit of time on it.
...Meaning... the one Rena had made was this one... E!!
For a moment I thought it may have been a trap Mion laid as she knew I'd pick up on it, but that probably wasn't the case.
...I wouldn't be so sure if I knew Mion had made it, but since she said Rena made it, it probably wasn't a trap.

<Keiichi>
"All right.
 My tea is ready, too.
 I'll start with the defending champ, Mion's grandma.
 ...Let's see."
Hmm.
 ...Not bad.
The smooth bean paste and soft, chewy texture left little to be desired!
The tea I drank afterwards also accentuated the experience.
 ...This... was an exquisite piece of work!
Now, how about Rena's?
The creation was so delicate, one would think it was a high-class Japanese dessert.
Since I normally had quite the appetite, I was slightly worried about the size of the portion...
 But, well... first, a bite...
...This was quite a difficult one to judge, actually!
The ingredients were exactly the same so there was little difference in flavor.
What was different was how it was shaped at the end, so it was to be expected.
So the deciding factors would be... presentation and volume.
The well-formed and well-sized champion, versus Rena the challenger, with a size you just couldn't get enough of!
I'd only had one bite of Rena's.
I would probably have to wait until after I was done eating to make my decision.
...Maybe... there was something hidden inside that could cause an upset...!

<Keiichi>
"*chew chew*
 ...
 Hmm..."
It seems my prediction was right.
My tongue touched something.
It didn't feel like something edible, so I reached in with my fingers and grabbed it.
...What...
 ...What was this?

Before I could fully comprehend what it was, I threw away the rest of the mochi I was eating as fast as I could!
It slammed against the wall, causing the bean jam to splatter.
Then, after sticking for a moment, it slid down to the floor.
...I was dumbstruck by my own actions.
What was I doing...!?
Rena had gone out of her way to make it for me... How could I!?
Dumbstruck, I looked down at the hand that performed such a vile act... then I remembered what I had taken out of my mouth...
At first I thought it was a hair.
Even though it was shorter than Mion's, Rena's hair was still quite long.
 And it wasn't this short.
It was also a bit too hard to be hair.
It was thick enough to roll around on my tongue.
...There was a bit of a metallic sheen on one end of it, ah yes, there was a hole for where thread goes through, like it was a sewing needle...
Yes, that's right...
It looked very much like a sewing needle...
...Exactly like one.
...The end was pointed as well.
 Quite sharply.
...It really did look just like a sewing needle.
Huh?
...What did I mean by, "looked very much like a sewing needle," just a bit ago...?
...I couldn't answer.
But a voice inside me already knew... and let me know by chattering my molars together.
...I couldn't stave off the terror welling up inside me...
Suddenly, I tasted something metallic and felt a prickling pain at the back of my throat.
...I stuck my finger in the back of my mouth and felt around to see if I was bleeding.
...Suddenly, I felt the urge to vomit.
The sharp taste of bile irritated the back of my throat.
I clasped both hands over my mouth and, after writhing in agony... I was somehow able to hold back the nausea.
I was finally able to breath normally again, but this time my heart was throbbing intensely.
...Then, it finally registered...
 ...Exactly what was mixed in with the mochi.
Before I could think of the correct word, my hands were already on the move.
*Splat*
 *Plop*
 *Splort*
I tossed the rest of the mochi against the wall.
The geometrical patterns of the scattered bean jam on the wall suddenly invoked a terrible omen in my mind...
After looking away, I dashed out to the hall and flew upstairs to my room, where I stayed under my covers until morning.
I clutched my own shoulders, howling madly in a mix of fear, anger, sadness and frustration...
This wasn't a threat or warning or reminder, nothing as simple as that...!!!
What had happened in Hinamizawa?
What is happening in Hinamizawa?
What would happen?
...I didn't know the answer to any of those questions.
Where did I break a taboo!?
Regardless... now Rena and Mion... and others...
 They consider me an enemy!
And they thought... I should just die!!!
I won't let you kill me!
 Not for such a... pointless reason!!!
I fell into a restless sleep as I was crushed by my negative emotions. It was as if I was being drawn into a billowing, bottomless swamp...



[Onikakushi Ch.11]

*Tap*
 *Tap*
 *Tap*
The sound of muffled footsteps stopped in front of the door to my room.
A moment of silence... as if whomever they belonged to was ascertaining if I was inside.
...Of all the things I should have been doing, I continued on with my restless slumber.
I was very much conscious, but my body hadn't caught up yet.
...Even with danger bearing down on me from just beyond the door...
 It was as if I was completely paralyzed, unable to move.
...Without a doubt, this was sheer terror.
Please... just leave...
Hey, why isn't my body awake yet?
 If they came into my room right now... then...!!

<Keiichi>
"UwaAaAaAaAAaH!!!!"

<Keiichi's mom>
"Eek!?"
I sprung to my feet and threw my covers at my mom, who was opening the door!!

<Keiichi's mom>
"Whoa!
 Keiichi!?
 What's the matter?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah... Ahh... sorry.
 ...I was still half-asleep..."
I thought it was still 1 or 2 AM.
But the morning sun was already streaming through the gap between the curtains.
...It felt nothing like morning.
Yesterday... I must have fallen asleep right after that.
...Then I should have gotten a full 10 hours of rest...
...But it didn't feel like that at all.
My internal clock was completely screwed up and my sense of balance felt off.
I felt feverish enough that it was clear to me that I was still not well.

<Keiichi's mom>
"...Well, Keiichi?
 How are you feeling?
 Can you make it to school?"
...I felt far from well enough...
 no, I wasn't mentally fit to go.
I was still plagued with the terror from yesterday...
If I had... swallowed that needle... what would have happened...?
Or what if it had pierced my tongue...?
There was undoubtedly a murderous intent... but I don't think that's all it was.
If they really wanted to kill me, then there were other, more certain ways to do it.
 They wouldn't resort to such a dubious method as having me swallow a needle.
...Meaning... I didn't want to believe it, but...
 going that far was... just a threat... from Rena and Mion.
"Aren't you glad you didn't die...? But next time we'll use a more assured method..."
Like that.
Something like sending a letter with a razor inside would have been a joke compared to this.

<Keiichi's mom>
"...Did you make it to the hospital?
 Did you take your medicine?"

<Keiichi>
"Mm... yeah. Kinda..."
Something about my mom's dubious gaze bothered me.
She seemed more concerned about her son missing two days of school rather than him being sick.
...It was definitely mental fatigue... I wasn't really physically ill.

<Keiichi's mom>
"It'll be hard for you to get back on track once your daily routine is thrown off.
 Come on, get on up!
 They say wellness is a state of mind."
I'd heard that line many times before.
I was given an award in elementary school for having perfect attendance... but it wasn't like I was "healthier" than everyone.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Come on, go wash your face.
 Breakfast is already ready.
 ...There isn't much time before Rena-chan comes and gets you."
Mom's tone meant I couldn't argue about it, so I had to give up on skipping a second day.

<Keiichi's mom>
"By the way... were you the one who got bean paste all over the living room wall, Keiichi?
 You shouldn't do something like that!
 Your father was quite angry!"
...I didn't feel particularly guilty for doing it, so I didn't have much of a reaction.
Also, Mom didn't question me any further about it.
She headed back downstairs after she was certain I was getting up.
What Mion said as she left yesterday...
 "I'd hate it if you missed school tomorrow..."
 ...Came back and dwelled in the back of my head.
What did she mean by that...?
I didn't even have to really think about it.
 ...She was saying, "don't be absent."
Taking that a bit further... It was the same as her saying I should just go about living my life as if nothing happened.
If I showed any signs of acting unusual, it would probably result in them making their move.
If I acted differently, someone like Ooishi-san, for example, might end up noticing that "something is up."
Meaning... if I didn't watch my mouth or did anything differently from the norm,
 in effect, it would end up communicating something to those who were "undesirable"...
And it seems... that was something that the girls didn't intend to forgive.
So...
 if I just went along as normal...
 No harm would come to me...
 Was that how it was going to be...?
All that misery I experienced up until yesterday would—almost creepily—just fade away... It was an enticing deal.
Just by forgetting everything I'd seen or heard these last few days... I'd be able to keep living on like normal.

<Keiichi>
"Th... There's no way such a
...
 selfish thing could..."
I swallowed hard...
I once again deliberated on the idea that I had just rejected.
Mion... was probably a good person who had her friends at heart.
...She was giving me... who had mistakenly broken some rule of theirs... a chance.
Was what I did... really something so unforgivable?
But Mion had given me another chance.
...She was saying... if I just forgot everything and kept living on like I had been, I'd be forgiven...

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi~!
 Your food is going to get cold!
 Hurry up and get down here~!
 Rena will be here if you don't hurry!"

<Keiichi>
"Ah... I'm coming!"
I crammed my textbooks into my bag and hastily made my way downstairs.
I picked at my somewhat bland breakfast.
It seemed that I didn't have much time. It was already past when I usually met up with Rena.
Given yesterday's events... she'd probably be here in the next five minutes.
...I needed to be ready to head to school by then...
I had to forget everything that had happened the past two days...
Forget it all and return to my normal life...
For this to be normal, I'll have to be where I normally meet up with Rena...
...Today of all days, the rice was dry and hard to get down.
Ding dong!
I jumped at the sound and dropped my chopsticks.
 ...That chime signaled that Rena had arrived.
Mom hurried me along.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Come on, Rena-chan's already here...!
 Hurry, hurry!"
My mother's merry smile and my gloomy face were polar opposites.
Honestly, I was reluctant to see Rena, who was waiting there on the other side of the door.
...The Rena on the other side... was it the Rena I knew?
I couldn't keep her waiting...
 I needed to do things as usual...

<Rena>
"Morning~!"
An invigorating greeting filtered in from across the doorway.

<Rena>
"...I came since Keiichi-kun was a bit late... will he be okay today, I wonder? ...I wonder?"
The manner in which Rena was concerned was, without a doubt, the Rena I knew.
...But that was probably only if I reciprocated.
Forget everything from yesterday... pretend as though nothing had happened...
Forget about the gruesome dismemberment.
 Forget about the mysterious deaths that happened the following years. 
...Forget about the people falling to their death... and the terminal illness and suicide... the fatal beatings... and the disappearances. Forget it. Forget all of it.
Forget that Rena and Mion were scary. Of course, forget it all.
 Forget about all of it.
 Forget about the mochi, too.
 Forgetforgetforget.
Rena, once again, asked to make sure.

<Rena>
"...Can you... make it to school?"

<Keiichi>
"Y... Yeah... I'm fine."

<Rena>
"Great!
 Then let's go! Mii-chan is waiting."
Rena showed me her usual bright smile.
I couldn't find any hint of deceit in her expression.
 ...My nervousness dissipated, giving way to relief...

<Rena>
"But you see, Satoko-chan was so insistent she could do it~!"
As we were walking, Rena talked about a lot of different stuff, more so than usual.

<Keiichi>
"...Hmm.
 ...Then?"

<Rena>
"Satoko-chan is clumsy, so she failed no matter how many times she tried!
 ...Hau... she was shou kyuute..."
Everything Rena talked about was just silly nonsense, so I just replied every so often and laughed from time to time. It was a rather laid-back conversation.
We passed by one of our neighbors and they called out to us.

<Villager>
"Oh, my! Keiichi-chan and Rena-chan, aren't you two a bit late today~?
 Mion-chan said she was going on ahead!"

<Rena>
"Uh-oh! Did Mii-chan look mad, I wonder?
 ...I wonder!?
 We need to hurry up, Keiichi-kun!"
After greeting our neighbor with a smile, Rena turned back to me and poked her tongue out.
Not expecting that, I couldn't help but crack a smile.

<Rena>
"...Ah, Keiichi-kun smiled."

<Keiichi>
"Huh... wh-what?"
Rena stopped and stared at me.

<Rena>
"...I was thinking that you still hadn't recovered from your cold since you seemed down this morning, Keiichi-kun... but now you seem fine.
 ...Fine!"
With a grin, she gently poked my cheek.
It was a bright, sincere smile.
...Hey, Keiichi Maebara.
...How can you still doubt Rena after she shows you a smile like that...?
Maybe I just had a high fever up until today, and I imagined everything that I thought happened because I was bedridden and delirious?
...I really hoped that was the case.
If God would grant me just one wish...
 There's only one thing that I'd wish for...
I would want what had happened in the past few days...
More specifically, from the night of the Watanagashi up until last night... I wanted all of that to have never happened.
I wonder how many times I'd wished for this these past few days...
As long as Rena kept on smiling like this... I think it might just become reality.
So I wanted Rena to keep on smiling...
 ...Keep on... smiling...

<Rena>
"So, Keiichi-kun.
 Those mochi yesterday... did you eat them all...?"

That vain wish of mine was instantly shattered.
My heart began palpitating. The relaxed morning mood suddenly became frigid.
Rena's smile... was the same as usual, her eyes were gentle as usual...
"Those mochi yesterday... did you eat them all...?"
...Of course she wasn't asking the question at face value.
In other words, Rena was asking...
 "Did you get the message?"
 ...She was probably trying to convey that...

<Rena>
" ...
Keiichi-kun?"
I was reluctant to give an answer. Rena stopped walking and stared deeply into my eyes.

<Keiichi>
"Ah..."
...Don't... Don't hesitate, Keiichi Maebara.
...Rena was acting the same as always, wasn't she?
I needed to respond in my usual way.
 ...Naturally, of course...!
But both my throat and mouth had gone dry, and my lips were stuck together...
Hurry and answer, Keiichi...
Not that much time had passed.
 I could still... keep the conversation going naturally...
I had to... say something quickly...

<Keiichi>
"...De-"

<Rena>
"De~?"
Rena playfully mimicked what I said when I finally squeaked something out.
Rena's reaction was still normal.
 ...It seems that there wasn't as long of a pause as I had thought.
Somehow, I finally squeaked out the rest.

<Keiichi>
"D... Delicious...!"
However, my strained efforts neither sullied nor brightened Rena's expression.
For a moment I panicked, thinking I had replied incorrectly.
But after a few moments, Rena broke into her usual soft smile and giggled with a joyful voice that seemed to echo through the morning air.
Being strung along by that laugh... I couldn't help but laugh as well.

<Rena>
"I see~
 So did you eat all of them, I wonder? ...I wonder?"
My timid smile froze again.
...Did you make it without swallowing the sewing needle?
 Was that what she was asking...?
If I had swallowed it, then I wouldn't be here.

<Keiichi>
"N-Nah... I couldn't... finish all of them.
 ...There's still some left."
I was scared out of my wits... but that's how I played it.

<Rena>
"...Huuh?
 What about the homework to see if you could tell which one Rena made...?"

<Keiichi>
"Ahahahaha... that homework... was it due today?"

<Rena>
"Yeah. It's due today.
 ...Mii-chan will get angry~ There's probably a penalty game ready for you."
We both laughed at each other again.
To a casual observer, it was just a typical morning.
If I could just let myself believe, then even I'd think it was just the usual morning routine...
But... I was certain I wasn't mistaken.
There was something unimaginable buried beneath the facade of this giggling Rena.

<Rena>
"LIES!!!"
I recalled that unexpected, piercing voice that I could hardly believe came from Rena's mouth.
The moment that image crossed my mind, I felt a cold sweat trickle down my back.
Was it only at that particular time that something evil had possessed Rena...?
No, that was wrong. That was still Rena. Ooishi-san told me, didn't he...?

<Ooishi>
"Actually, I looked into her. Before Ryuugu-san moved away to Hinamizawa, she was suspended from school.
 It seems she went through her school building and broke all of the windows."
Rena had a disorder... that normal people didn't.
 No matter how pleasantly she smiled... that fact would not change.
But... I couldn't even imagine... how she looked as she broke all the glass throughout the school.
One thing I knew was that it wasn't something spur-of-the-moment.
If it was some sudden outburst of anger, then maybe she'd break a pane or two...
But she broke all of the windows all throughout her school.
Just imagine going through your own school breaking the windows with a bat.
Swinging full-force at each pane of glass, one after another. Paying no heed to the flying shards...
Your classmates aghast.
...Unable to move from the sudden turn of events.
I wonder where she could have found the most windows lined up in a row...
 ...Probably the hallway.
*Smash*
 Walk...
 Wind up...
 *Smash*
 Walk...
 Wind up...

It was difficult for me to connect that horrifying image with the Rena smiling at me right now...
But... I just had to imagine it.
...Impossible because it was unimaginable... that naive way of thinking no longer worked.
The unpleasant, piercing sound of shattered glass, the crunching noise as Rena treads across the broken shards, walking towards me.
...Rena's classmates going pale as they forget to even breathe.
I wondered what they did as Rena came closer, breaking windows along her path...
Did they earnestly try to bring her to her senses by saying something?
Or did they jump at her, trying to stop her savagery?
Or did they run to the staff room to call for the teachers?
Probably none of those.
In the face of that bloodcurdling sight, of Rena busting window after window... undoubtedly, all they could do was silently clear a path for her.
Dumbfounded... just clearing the path for Rena to continue.
...It would be cruel to blame anyone for looking the other way.
No, they weren't simply looking the other way...
 ...They knew it was the only way they could to protect themselves.
If they had done something differently from the rest... They may have suddenly found themselves as Rena's new target.
What would Rena have done to whoever attracted her attention?
The answer was obvious.
 ...She would have undoubtedly acted according to her whims.
...Meaning they would—I would—be the next window.
Rena, staring into my eyes, shards of glass crunching and crackling underfoot as she drew closer.
...I was also drawn into her eyes, paralyzed.
Then Rena struck me with the bat over and over again, like I was one of those windows.
I crouched down on to the floor, desperately protecting my head.
 Rena didn't care whether it was my head or my back.
 Zealously, she hits me again and again.
What kind of expression was she making as she was doing this over and over again?
...I peered up to see.
...Her expression was so indifferent,  it was completely unnerving.
It's because no matter how many times she struck me, I didn't make as pleasant a sound as the other windows.
She struck me continuously.
 Over and over again.
 The sound Rena wanted didn't come out.
 Our classmates standing around didn't try to stop her.
 They didn't want to be the next window.
Somebody save me...
 ...Turning a blind eye unless we're hanging out...!?
...But of course, everyone in class scrambled to obtain the highest standardized test scores.
 ...They'd gain nothing from saving a cram school try-hard like me...
Eventually, there would be a faint sound, similar to when you crack open a walnut, and some sort of reddish-black spray would shoot out...
Anyway, it wasn't that Rena momentarily lost herself in her anger.
...After forcing myself to breathe and calming down my heart, I recalled what Ooishi-san told me.

<Ooishi>
"...and in the counselor's medical report, he recorded all of the conversations he had with Rena-san...
 'It' shows up...
 And quite a bit at that."

<Keiichi>
"What does...?"

<Ooishi>
"She mentioned...
 the word 'Oyashiro-sama.'"
Following that, Rena was suspended and had regular examinations at the hospital.
Then, as Rena was undergoing counseling, she said it over and over...
 "Oyashiro-sama."

<Ooishi>
"It seems that the Oyashiro-sama she spoke of was like a ghost, appearing in her house every night.
 Standing over her pillow looking down at her."
That was only a piece of their conversation, so I still couldn't see the big picture... but it was by no means a happy little conversation.
Then what Rena did... Was she saying that ghastly incident was a result of her being possessed by Oyashiro-sama...?
Up until now, I didn't want to believe in Oyashiro-sama's curse.
That's why I wanted to say the mysterious deaths every year happened because of some sort of conspiracy.
Every time I talked with Ooishi-san, I was more certain that the deaths were the work of men and not of some curse.
Except... if it was people perpetrating the incidents... my friends were somehow deeply connected.
If I refused to believe that the curse was real... then I would have to believe those who acted the kindest to me were deeply involved in the incidents.
Why?
 How?
 For what reason?
 ...Was Rena?
 ...Was everybody?
It was much more painful and troublesome than accepting that it was just Oyashiro-sama's curse.
In the aftermath, Rena had admitted to her doctor that it was because she was possessed by Oyashiro-sama.
I felt a strange sense of relief from that.
So that's how it was.
There wasn't a second side to Rena.
...She did that...
 because she was possessed by something strange like Oyashiro-sama...
It wasn't Rena's fault.
 Oyashiro-sama was the one to blame...!
I knew...
This was all backwards.
Refusing to believe there was a curse, I wanted there to be a human perpetrator. 
...Now that my close friends were the ones under suspicion, I changed my beliefs at my own convenience, saying it was Oyashiro-sama's curse to blame.
Which was the better choice? Accepting that Oyashiro-sama's curse exists...
 Or that Rena and the rest of them... were deeply involved in the string of mysterious deaths?
I didn't want to think about it.
If I just didn't think about it, I'd be able to continue the same as always... I wanted to believe that...
But...
 ...
That was no longer possible.
I had received their message.
...It was pathetic of me to try and bend the meaning to my own convenience.
Regardless of whether my opponent were a human or a curse.
 ...I won't let it kill me.
As if I would just bend over and give in!
 ...For no good reason at all...!

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun?
 ...You've been making a really weird face.
 Why, I wonder?
 I wonder?"
Inhaling sharply upon hearing Rena's voice, I came back to my senses.
Before I had realized it, we were already at the entrance.
Shaking my head a few times, I exorcised all those terrifying thoughts.
No matter how you looked at it... there's no way Rena could have done such terrible things...!
It was like I was trying to placate myself...
As I slid the door open, a blackboard eraser loaded with chalk dropped down on my head the moment I stepped into the classroom.
The chalk dust went into my eyes, inducing a brief moment of agony.

<Satoko>
"Oh ho ho ho ho!
 How befitting for the truant Keiichi-san~!"

<Rika>
"Good morning to both of you, Keiichi and Rena."

<Rena>
"Good morning-☆ Satoko-chan, Rika-chan~!"
Not quite in the mood for it, I didn't really react to Satoko's trap.
Satoko braced herself as I passed by, expecting me to attack her. She seemed a bit disappointed as I simply walked by silently.

<Satoko>
"Wh-What is this...?
 How discouraging, indeed."

<Rika>
"...Keiichi doesn't seem back to his usual self yet."

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 ...Take it easy on him for today, 'kay?"
Suddenly, there was a slap down on my shoulder. It hurt a bit...

<Mion>
"Hey! Kei-chan, did you get enough rest?"
It was Mion.
My mind was full with the stuff about Rena... but Mion was also a party of interest.
Remember, Keiichi.
 ...That hawkish gaze from yesterday.

<Keiichi>
"
...
Yeah... Morning."

<Mion>
"What's with that unenergetic greeting?
 Did you eat the mochi I brought you?"
I'm like this because I ate them...
 Those words were itching to be blurted out.

<Keiichi>
"...I really just didn't have the appetite.
 ...I ate a few, but quite a lot were left over."

<Mion>
"Huh? What about the homework?
 Do you have an answer for which one was Rena's?"

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun said he forget his homework.
 Ahahahaha."

<Mion>
"...Sheesh... then we can't help it... time for your penalty~
 ...Mihehehehe!"
Flashing a lurid smile, Mion returned to her seat.
There was nothing from our exchanges that would cause our classmates to suspect anything was amiss.
But of course...
Anyone listening to our conversations up until this morning...
 wouldn't see anything suspicious.
That was why... it was so frightening.
They acted in a way that, regardless of whatever happened to Keiichi Maebara, no one would ever suspect them... That fact had me terrified.
Soon the teacher came.
After she asked how I felt and took attendance, another dull, ordinary day began.
This free study period was a convenient time to consider where I stood.
I gently closed my eyes and pondered the ridiculous position I was in right now.
First of all... What I shouldn't forget... was how dangerous of a situation I was in.
I had fallen out of favor with them.
After interacting with Ooishi-san multiple times, I could see it as I was getting closer to the heart of the matter.
The warning yesterday with the mochi was a good indicator of that.
...No... Calling it a warning was just my habit of understating things.
It probably had no meaning beyond stunting my progress and buying themselves some time.
...Until they had a method of completely 'erasing' me...
 They were just biding their time.
Even though they were keeping me under their thumb with threats, it didn't change the fact that I knew too much.
The chilling sensation of my desk made me recall Satoshi Houjou, the boy who was using this seat until last year when he disappeared.
Was he also... similar to me?
Did he learn something he shouldn't have... and was erased...?
...Damn...!
 I wouldn't... let them get rid of me so easily...
 Never...!!
But... were they really trying to kill me...?
I've had these contradictory feelings for a while now. Even though I suspected them... I felt I had to cover for them.
Even having witnessed all of their suspicious behavior, a morning like this just made it all seem like an elaborate hoax.
 No, that's just what I want to believe.
Doubting my friends?
Covering for them?
My life was in danger...
Or was it?
Actually, I was debating the wrong point.
Given my current situation... Those points were something that should have been deliberated on a long time ago...
But really... Rena and the rest of them...
 Were they actually aiming to kill me?
The little voice inside me continued to torment me with these unresolvable trains of thought.
Are you an idiot, Keiichi Maebara!? The answer should be obvious!
B... But maybe... that sewing needle might have been just an accident, right...?
How could you screw up and drop a sewing needle into a piece of mochi!? The benefit of the doubt can only go so far!!
Both Rena and Mion... had acted and behaved suspiciously... but maybe it was all some sort of misunderstanding...
What kind of misunderstanding!?
 It wasn't just suspicious... it was outright ludicrous, right!?
Rena just corrected me for lying... and Mion only asked me about what I had for lunch...
Rena was standing outside my door eavesdropping for a solid hour!?
Sh-She was... probably just waiting for my phone call to end...
For a whole HOUR outside your room!? And is it normal to go home afterwards without saying anything!?
...
You heard from Ooishi-san, didn't you!?
 About what Rena did at her former school?
B-But... At the hospital, she said it was Oyashiro-sama's fault she...

<Keiichi>
"Cut it out, Keiichi Maebara. Don't you realize they're out to kill you!?"
Ngh!?
I inadvertently blurted those words out loud.
Hearing myself say that so directly left me dumbfounded for a few moments. Afterwards, I had to look around to check if anyone else had heard it.
My little soliloquy cut a little too close to the truth.
Even though I could feel the murderous intent from Rena and the others... part of me somewhere was still trying to deny that.
This late in the game... such hesitation could be fatal.
 ...I knew that.
But... I was just your average student... a man living his normal, ordinary life!
Do you think I could suddenly believe... that my friends, who I had been happily laughing together with up until last Sunday... now intended to kill me...!?
 Right...?

<Keiichi>
"You're too soft, Keiichi!!!!"
This time, I remembered to keep my voice down so only I could hear it.
There was one thing I now understood.
I was... too soft.
I didn't completely understand how dangerous Rena and the rest of them were.
 No, I wasn't trying to understand.
I was too soft for not listening to Ooishi-san when he was earnestly showing me the heart of the matter.
I didn't listen because I was too busy pretending to be dejected.
 I didn't comprehend it.
 I was just running away.
I didn't comprehend it, so nobody had any notion to try and kill me? I needed to get rid of such naive thoughts...!
As I made that resolution, I heard the bell signaling the end of class.
...So soon.
The day was already over.
I didn't recall eating lunch or doing anything in class.
My friends were putting their desks together in preparation for club activities.
Not long ago, I would probably have happily jumped into that circle...

<Satoko>
"My, my, Keiichi-san?
 How rude of you to even think about leaving!"
The way Satoko spoke was so typical and familiar... it almost physically hurt.

<Rena>
"Huh? Keiichi-kun, is today not a good day, I wonder? ...I wonder?
 And we were going to win big together...
 Hau..."
Seeing Rena's expression... which said she was really looking forward to today, was hard to take.
Hey, Keiichi... Maybe Ooishi-san is just some enormous jerk trying to separate me from the others by lying to me...?
Slap!!
Trying to expunge such weak-minded thinking, I slapped myself in the face.

<Rena>
"K-Keiichi-kun...?"
Yeah... was Rena really trying to kill me...??
I wish someone would tell me it was a hoax.
 I didn't care if it actually was one or not, I just wanted someone to say it was.
...Guh, yet another weak-willed thought...!
How did I ever become this naive!?

<Rena>
"A-Are you all right...? Does your head hurt?"
Apparently that was how my inner dilemma appeared to Rena.

<Rena>
"You're pale!
 Can you make it home by yourself?
 ...Maybe I should accompany you home, I wonder? ...I wonder?"

<Keiichi>
"No... it's okay... sorry.
 I can get home by myself.
 Just have the meeting without me."
Upon hearing that I wasn't going to participate in the club meeting, Mion pouted unhappily.

<Mion>
"Since Kei-chan was so bent on a revenge match, we were even going to play that deduction game from before too."

<Satoko>
"Keiichi-san doesn't have the burning desire for a rematch?
 How pathetic~!"
I wouldn't fall for some dumb taunt.
Without even a real retort, I just grabbed my bag and was about to get up.
Someone's hand perched itself gently on my head.

<Rika>
"... Keiichi doesn't seem to be well.
 ...How very unfortunate."
It was Rika-chan.
She was stretched up as far as she could, doing her best to pat my head with her petite hand...
It felt so nice... which made things even harder.

<Keiichi>
"Sorry...
 Everybody.
 ...See you!"
That's all I said as I quickly left the classroom.
They said something to me as I was leaving, but I couldn't make it out.
I managed to make it all the way to the entrance in that state of mind.
 Took out my shoes...
 put them on,
 and went forward.
 Forward...
Harden that heart... Keiichi Maebara...!
They were... for some unfathomable reason... trying to kill me!!
They were plotting something dubious, watching my every move!!
But... I couldn't hate them...!!
Because... weren't they my friends!?!
Part of me lamented my naiveté, while another part lamented the fact that I had lost something important by lamenting over it in the first place.
It felt like my personality was being ripped in two, along with my body.
If this is what Oyashiro-sama's curse was like...
 Then it was just... too harsh.
Hey, Oyashiro-sama... I was wrong for not believing in your curse...
But I believed in it now.
Completely.
Your curse does exist...
So, seriously... give me a break...
 I beg you... come on...
Dinner was unusually bland.
It had no flavor or aroma.
...The miso soup that normally tantalized my appetite instead tasted like nothing but boiled water.
Dad was eating with us that night.
It was a rare occurrence in this household.
When he got into his work, he ate and slept on his own schedule.
 My dad never cared about the time.
Since my dad was at the dinner table, it either meant he had just reached a good point to take a break or he was in a slump.

<Keiichi's dad>
"So yeah, he just doesn't understand the motivation creators have."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Your partnership was just a verbal agreement, wasn't it?
 If it's so hard to agree on things, why not just end it?"

<Keiichi's dad>
"I feel like it's an industry with a lot of back-scratching... but when it gets in the way of business..."
I wasn't able to pick out much of my mom and dad's conversation, but I could tell it wasn't a very pleasant topic.
...That, of course, made the disgusting food even less appealing.
Staring listlessly at the exchange between my parents, my mind wandered off to the same thought processes I had going all day long.
...Friends close to me—no, they used to be friends. But I could no longer trust them. Right now, I was greatly lacking in allies.
People I trusted... people I could depend on when push came to shove. They were something I just didn't have.
...Having just one ally would have been incredibly reassuring in the currently hopeless situation I was in...
I put down my chopsticks and looked over at my parents, who were still talking about work.
The first course of action that came to mind was to tell my parents everything.
Currently, there wasn't a single person from Hinamizawa I could trust 100%. That meant the only people I could trust were my parents.
But... If I told them everything that happened up until now, would they understand?
Rena, for example.
That neighborly Rena, who was so diligent in looking after me, came to get me every day, and sometimes brought over a share of what she made.
How could I explain... that she wanted to kill me??
No matter how I explained, it would probably be difficult for anybody to comprehend.
My somewhat eccentric dad wouldn't understand, and my high-strung mom would probably drag me off to a psychiatrist in the blink of an eye.
Sadly... That was the amount of trust that existed in our relationship.
Even if they did come to understand... what could they possibly do?
Unless they could uncover the truth, they wouldn't be able to protect me.
...No... By informing them of these 'unnecessary' things, I'd be putting my parents in danger as well...!
Considering that the victims in past incidents were often married couples... I couldn't even joke about it.
For the entire Maebara family to have an accident or to just vanish into thin air... It was easily possible in Hinamizawa...
What was important here was that knowing something 'unnecessary' put you in danger.
The most unsettling question was... how did they know that I knew...?
"As long as they didn't know," my parents might not fall victim... that was one way to think about it, I guess...?
At least it was like that in my case.
 After I found out, things started becoming odd.
...In other words, it meant the following:
As long as my parents didn't know anything, nothing would happen to them.
Which means that this house would be a safe haven as long as my parents were in.
...I knew these were just assumptions based on conjecture on top of conjecture.
Wanting this house to be a safe haven... that was the pinnacle of my weak-willed method of thinking.
I had to concede that it was not completely safe... It was only safer than the outside...
I knew that I couldn't rely on my parents? No... I couldn't risk getting my parents involved.
Then the only person who could be my ally would be... Ooishi-san. Him, and him alone.
He was the only person who understood the situation I was in.
He didn't care so much about my safety, but he was without a doubt passionate about solving this case.
...It was a bit frustrating.
...Ooishi-san was basically the whole reason I was in this mess. Now to get out of it, I had to rely on him...
Meaning... it was all going according to his devices.
It was just my job to look appetizing while bobbing in the waves as bait.
 ...Then, when the fish started gathering around, Ooishi-san would pull up the big haul!
It was slightly infuriating... but even I thought that was the best course of action.
So, then... what should I do!?
...Patience was the first rule of fishing.
Just keep waiting until the fish actually bites...
But I wasn't simply bait.
There were lots of ways for me to struggle before being devoured.
When they struck, I needed to somehow dodge just enough and tag out to Ooishi-san.
No question, it was going to be hard.
 ...The timing to bring Ooishi-san in would be difficult.
He was in the city, not Hinamizawa.
 So if I phoned him in my moment of need, it would take him about 30 minutes to reach me.
 So I needed to run away for those 30 minutes...
For example... if we set up a rendezvous point for dire situations or something.
 I'd just have to hide out there until Ooishi-san arrived.

<Keiichi>
"...Okay... I can almost... see it now..."
I was still being chased around in the dark by boogiemen, but now I knew which way to go. I would never have imagined this would be so reassuring.
Oh yeah...
It would probably be best if I had a concealed weapon for when things got rough.
...Typically, that would call for a switchblade.
But that wasn't too reassuring for combat.
Also, since it was recognized as a weapon by the public, that also wasn't good.
Really, when the time comes... a long weapon like a bat would work in my favor.
I remembered there was a metal bat at school.
 ...I could be confident with that when push came to shove.
...If I pretended I was practicing my swing, then it wouldn't be suspicious for me to always carry it around.
...I could go to school early tomorrow and secure it.
Just possessing a weapon may be enough to deter them.
Also, one more thing... Insurance...
It could be something like a note or memo. I could write down everything that's happened as a sort of journal.
In case I suddenly vanished, the journal would be left behind.
...With my journal in his possession, Ooishi-san should be able to avenge my death.
I left my parents engrossed in their conversation about work and went back to my room.
I tore out a piece of paper from a notebook and made my way to my desk.
...Last time I wrote a journal was for summer homework in elementary school.
In the off chance something bad happened, the police could use my diary as a lead.
 ...So I should only write down the facts.
How should I start...
I jotted down my thoughts as they came.
"I, Keiichi Maebara, am in fear for my life."
It made me laugh nervously. It was a line that showed up often in detective stories. I never even dreamed that I would be in the type of situation where I'd write it myself.
"I do not know why they are after my life."
Rena and the others were suspicious, but I had no proof.
 ...And that's why I couldn't write anything more.
I laughed wryly at myself for writing such a passage draped in mystery.
Would the police be able to get the hint from reading this enigmatic passage?
I could only pray that they would.
...What I prayed for the most though, was that this journal never needed to play its part...
 Here, I laughed nervously.
It was too simple, so I wrote down one more line I just thought of.
"The only thing I do know is that it has to do with Oyashiro-sama's curse."
Was that... too much...?
...I probably shouldn't write more than that.
 ...If I wrote any more, then it would seem like I was just delusional.
In order to appear to the reader that the person who had written this was of sound mind... I chose not to write anything else at that point.
... I just needed to add more as I learned more about the truth.
I folded the paper and thought about a place to hide it.
...By hiding it somewhere obvious, there was the chance that 'they' would uncover it instead.
On the other hand, if it was in too obscure of a location, then there was the risk of nobody finding it at all...
In the end, I decided to take the clock off my wall and stick my folded note on the back of it with scotch tape.
 After that, I put the clock back into its normal position.
Yeah...
 It didn't look like anything was hidden behind it.
Now I needed to set it up such that, "if anything happens to me," my parents could find it.
I looked at it from countless different angles until I was satisfied and I made my way downstairs.
My parents were still talking about work.
It didn't look like it was going to end anytime soon, so I cut in.

<Keiichi>
"Ah, sorry to interrupt!!
 ...I have something I want to talk to you about."
I'd never started off a conversation like that before, so my parents were both startled. They stopped talking and turned towards me.

<Keiichi's mom>
"What is it, Keiichi?"

<Keiichi>
"I have a favor to ask of you, please listen.
 ...Um, just in case, yeah?"

<Keiichi's dad>
"If it's not urgent, can we do this later?
 Right now, Mommy and Daddy have something urgent they're talking about."
I didn't think their talk was more urgent than mine. In any case, I stated my request.

<Keiichi>
"Just in case, okay?
 If I die..."
Both of my parents' eyes went as wide as saucers.

<Keiichi>
"If I die...
 I want you to put the clock on my wall in my coffin."
If they did that, then they'd probably find it.
 My memoir.
Both my parents remained wide-eyed, not moving an inch.
...I couldn't blame them.

<Keiichi>
"I made that clock in shop class and I really like it...
 So, please."

<Keiichi's mom>
"...What's the matter?
 Keiichi...
 Did something happen?"
Mom was finally able to ask me with a questioning gaze.
Of course, this was a normal response for when someone's son suddenly talked about a subject like this.
I felt bad about making them worry, but right now I just wanted them to think about the 'clock' in my room.
With the awkward mood leaving the room in silence, I decided to go back up to my room.

<Keiichi>
"I... want to get to school early tomorrow, so I'm going to bed.
 Good night."
Saying only that, I left the living room.
I needed to get to school early tomorrow and secure that bat.
I should make today the last day I went to school with Rena.
As I climbed the stairs, I heard my mom call my name, but I pretended not to hear her.
It wasn't something I could talk about with my parents.
If I talked about it... it would only make things more dangerous.
The fight that had begun was mine and mine alone, I couldn't rely on anybody.
I wouldn't be killed...
 Not when I still knew nothing...



[Onikakushi Ch.12]

This was the first time I'd ever woke with such clarity.
It was 5:59, just moments before my alarm would go off.
 ...I was amazed at the precision of my internal clock.
I had made preparations for the next day of school before I went to bed.
I changed quickly and descended to the deserted lower floor.
It appeared that my mom was still asleep.
 ...Neither breakfast nor lunch was ready.
Yesterday, I just unilaterally declared that I would be leaving early today, so it couldn't be helped.
I slathered jam on some bread and topped it with instant cocoa. Just as I was finishing up breakfast, Mom rose groggily from her slumber.

<Keiichi's mom>
"...My, Keiichi, you're up early.
 Is there some sort of school event?"

<Keiichi>
"Not really."
Answering bluntly, I picked up my bag and stood after stuffing two slices of bread down my throat.

<Keiichi's mom>
"You're leaving already?
 What about lunch?
 If you don't wait a bit, I can't make it."
If I waited for her to make my lunch, then it would end up being the same time as usual.
If I did that, it would raise the chances of me running into Rena and Mion on the way.
Yes. From today onwards, I was going to go to school alone.

<Keiichi>
"I'll be fine for today."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Then what will you do for lunch?"

<Keiichi>
"I'll slip out and buy some bread or something at the store."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Really? ...Then here's some lunch money.
 Be sure to bring me back the receipt."
I took the thousand-yen bill from Mom and slipped it into my pocket.

<Keiichi's mom>
"It's pretty early, is Rena-chan up this early as well...?"

<Keiichi>
"No, just me."

<Keiichi's mom>
"...Did you tell Rena-chan that you're leaving early?"
...I have no reason to tell her every little detail, now do I...?
Finding it difficult answering the onslaught of questions, I made an annoyed face.

<Keiichi>
"Tell Rena that I went ahead when she comes."

<Keiichi's mom>
"H-Hey, Keiichi!? Wait...!"
It's not that I didn't trust my parents...
 I just couldn't rely on them.
They couldn't help me... I could only hope that they didn't get involved.
 It was safer that way.
My mom's annoying voice was cut off by the slam of the door.
For the first time since I moved here,  I headed down the road to school alone.
Up until now, I had always walked down the same path at the same time each day.
So I always met with the same people at the same places.
But today was different.
I didn't meet the people I would normally and nobody was at the places where I would have normally met them.
Of course, Rena wasn't in the spot where we usually met and there wasn't anyone at the spot where we would have met up with Mion.
The length of the trees' shadows, the morning air, and the brightness of the sun... It was a completely different type of morning from what I was used to.
Without a doubt, it felt strange.
It left me with the impression that... I had destroyed the illusion Hinamizawa had set up for me before it had enough time to prepare all of the props needed to deceive me.

<Villager>
"...Myyy, Keiichi-kun.
 You're so early today. Is everyone meeting early this morning?"
The person who called out to me was someone we always passed by as they were taking a walk along the edge of the fields.
...Their name was... uhh... I forgot.
 ...Of course, this wasn't the spot where we usually passed each other.

<Keiichi>
"I woke up early today... so I thought it would be a good change of pace.
 That's all."
I threw out a random excuse.

<Villager>
"What about Rena-chan and Mion-chan?
 Are you by yourself today?"

<Keiichi>
"Well... yeah..."
I was being asked the same type of questions my mom was asking.
So I answered them in the same uninteresting, vague manner.
...It wasn't funny being asked where Rena was each time I passed by someone.
But maybe it was to be expected.
...It was because for so long, we were always together so amicably.
Even I felt that if I let my guard down, we could still be frie-
 ...

...Stop it, Keiichi.
 Don't think about that anymore.
You spent all day yesterday thinking about how dangerous it was to go soft, didn't you...?
Bebebeeeep!!!
A car horn blared from out of nowhere.
Even though I was walking, lost in thought, that horn was way too close.
A mechanical behemoth barreled at me from behind, catching me completely off guard.
By the time I turned around, the van's hulking chassis was almost on top of me.
I'd seen plenty of cars veer to the opposite shoulder to avoid pedestrians, but this car was doing the opposite.
It felt like...
 It felt like there was somebody on the opposite shoulder and the van was swerving in my direction to avoid them.
That blissfully ignorant train of thought delayed me from realizing something much, much more important.
That large mass was hurtling right at me.
 ...Was it going to hit me!?!?
The inside of my head instantly flooded with a painfully cold liquid!!
In that moment... the scene before me—no, time itself—had frozen.
In the silence of that frozen moment, I compared the van—so close that I had no way to dodge it—and my body, the upper half twisted awkwardly in order to look behind me.
There was no way I could dive out of the way in my current position...
If I lost focus now, this moment would unpause, and I would probably be plowed over, caught in this silly pose.
Bend my upper body over towards the paddy by the side of the road.
...If I bent far enough, I'd get away with just being hit by the side-view mirror...!
As soon as the thought crossed my mind, the temporal stasis was shattered by the deafening sound of the van.
The side mirror struck my shoulder, sending me spinning off through the air like a top, locked in my contorted position...!!
Kesplash!!!

Sent tumbling through the air, I crashed into the muddy paddy by the side of the road.
My entire body was soiled and drenched...!!
But the choice I had made in that instant was unmistakably for the best.
I was covered in mud, but when the alternative was being hit by the car, it was the closest I could be to being unscathed.
Rising out from the paddy, I had enough in me to glare over at the stopped van and yell profanities at the driver.
I'm not sure if he was able to see me, but the van sped off suddenly.

<Keiichi>
"Wait, damn it!!
 This... was what they call a hit-and-run, wasn't it!?"
I couldn't help but continue yelling out profanities.
The disgrace from being covered in mud hurt me more than any physical wounds.
I slogged through the muddy paddy and made my way back onto the road.

<Keiichi>
"This is a crime, God damn it...!!"
Shit!! I'll track you down and sue you!!
 If I go looking for a van, I'm sure to find it in this little village...!!
The path I was on had rice paddies on either side, and it had become so narrow that one car could barely fit through.
It wasn't a place you could tear full speed down in a car, let alone pass by pedestrians.
Not only was it a narrow road, but the car just now was closer to my side of the road than the other when it went past me...
Even as I cursed, I was desperately trying to suppress the dark cloud roiling up within me.
This wasn't just a hit and run...
 That car just now...
 was trying to run me over, wasn't it...?
Thinking back... I did feel like there had been a car creeping up on me slowly for a while.
That's right. As soon as I'd parted ways with that person taking a walk... I had that feeling the whole time.
If it had wanted to pass me, then it had no shortage of chances.
Normally, I would have felt suspicious and turned around sooner.
But... I was lost in thought and now was kicking myself for not realizing it was there sooner.
And then... when the path became narrow and there was no one else in sight... he floored it...
If I had hesitated for even a moment... the result would have been no laughing matter.
As the adrenaline rush from nearly being run over subsided... and the realization of just how terrifying the preceding events were, sunk in.
There was no doubt about it. That van was intentionally trying to hit me...
A cold, viscous sweat seeped from my scalp and slid down my back before dribbling off.
...I struggled to avoid falling into a panic.
There was still the possibility that this was really just an accident.
...Calm down, Keiichi!!
But also don't be so naive, Keiichi!!
Being that lax will get you killed next time!!
You need to always be on your toes.
Don't give them any openings!!
If my enemy was really out to kill me, then next time, they would use a more reliable method.
If that time came and I was acting like I was now...!!
...Getting covered in mud was the price I had paid for my own naiveté.
Covered in mud, but without injury.
 Not even a sprain.
I guess this was what you would call the silver lining.
I began walking again, this time cautiously.
I wouldn't even show a hint of carelessness.
I had suspected only Rena and the others up until now.
...No, it was because I had suspected them that I had believed there were no other enemies.
Ooishi-san had said so, didn't he...?
There was the possibility of a village conspiracy...!!
Was I really mired so deeply in this situation that I had no choice but to try and carry on as usual?
Wouldn't it be safest just to hole myself up in my house...?
But... the moment I abandoned my regular routine, everyone around me would abandon theirs as well...
That was just too horrifying of a thought.
I recalled the tales Ooishi-san told me, of when Hinamizawa was still called Onigafuchi.
A frightening tale of an entire village of demons hunting their prey, surrounding them and eating them alive.
One must not interfere with the demons.
One must pretend not to see it...
The enemy were numerous: the whole village.
 ...The villagers with their unwavering faith in the curse would do nothing to help me.
The strong, sudden flash of sunshine made me slightly dizzy.
...I had no idea what was going on anymore...
When I suspected it was the work of man, I would catch a glimpse of Oyashiro-sama's curse...
And when I suspected it was Oyashiro-sama's curse, someone would poke their head out.
What was coincidence? What was intentional?
...Who was my enemy? Who was just a bystander?
No, what I really, truly wanted to know was... how did I end up with the proverbial bullseye painted on my back?
Eventually... an answer in a form I could understand will appear...
I don't care when that will happen...
Because until then... I cannot die...!
That alone fueled my resolve to fight and will keep me alive.
I remembered seeing the metal bat in the gym storage shed, but there was a padlock on the door barring my entry.
At the very least, I wanted to get my hands on it before everyone else arrived at school...
I circled around the school grounds impatiently.
But all I could find were things like pieces of lumber, nothing that I could bring into the classroom easily.
Then... I had an epiphany.
 I should search inside the classroom.
If it was something in the classroom to begin with, then there wouldn't be a problem.
I could tell that everyone's indoor shoes were still in their lockers.
Good thing I came early. Nobody else was here yet.
I wondered... what could I find in the classroom?
I didn't think I could find an especially effective weapon like a bat.
But it couldn't be helped at this point.
Until the gym storage shed was open, I needed to find a substitute.
A lingering hint of naiveté whispered that there was no way I'd be attacked at school.
But... such soft ideas would no longer protect me.
To think that they were slowly making their way into parts of my life that I had once thought impenetrable.
...In the worst case... my own house might not be safe anymore...
That was an incredibly frightening thought...
But I believed that not considering the worst case scenario would have been even more frightening...
Anyways, I will survive.
...So long as I lived, then I will definitely be able to escape this labyrinth of nonsense...
 Definitely...
My exploration of the classroom came to an impasse.
That much was to be expected.
There was no way there would be anything that could be a weapon in the classroom.
In case of emergency, there was probably nothing I could do but swing my own chair around...
My gaze landed on the lockers that had come to be used for personal storage.
The locker that Mion used to store her pile of games was among them.
There was one for each person in the class, all lined up.
 Of course, there was one for me as well.
Oh yeah, there was supposed to still be a track suit in my locker.
...Seeing me covered in mud would be strange.
 I should go change later...
...But first, I needed a weapon.
If one of my classmates came, it would be hard to rummage through all the lockers.
I swiftly began opening the lockers one by one.
They were mostly just filled with things like gym clothes, personal items, and umbrellas.
...An umbrella.
...If I couldn't find anything better, then this would have to be my weapon.
I was about to give up on finding anything decent when I opened a locker that held exactly what I wanted.
It was, without a doubt, a metal bat.
It was well-worn and pretty beaten up, but there was no doubt it was usable.
In that locker that reeked of mold, there also hung a baseball uniform.
It was probably the locker of a student in a peewee league or something like that.
...If that was the case, then he'd probably ask for it back.
At that time I could hear the voices of the children scuffling their way noisily in from the hallway.
Amongst them I could make out Rika-chan and Satoko.

<Rika>
"...Good morning."

<Satoko>
"My, my, you're quite early this morning, Keiichi-san."
I nonchalantly hid the bat I was holding behind my back.

<Satoko>
"Wh-What is with your outfit!?
 You're covered in mud!"

<Keiichi>
"Y-Yeah... I had a little incident.
 I'm going to change now, so cut me some slack."
With that said, I began taking off my clothes. Satoko began to blush just as I expected her to.

<Satoko>
"Ch-Changing in front of a lady... Have you no tact at all!?"

<Keiichi>
"I would think that a lady staring at someone who was changing would be the one lacking in tact.
 There's no changing room for the boys, so just deal with it."
As Satoko feigned disgust, she went into the hall, still blushing.
Conversely, Rika-chan continued to stare at me preparing to change.

<Keiichi>
"...If Rika-chan is a lady as well, then I don't think it would be appropriate for you to be watching."

<Rika>
"I'm not a lady, so it's fine."
She deliberately pouted and looked at me with upturned eyes.

<Keiichi>
"...Then, starting now, you're a lady."

<Rika>
"If I'm a lady, then I suppose I must."
Rika-chan, appearing to be satisfied with being considered a lady, made her way to join Satoko in the hallway.
Just as I breathed a sigh of relief, Rika-chan stopped suddenly and turned back towards me.

<Rika>
"...Are you going to start playing baseball?"
It seems that Rika-chan had noticed the bat.

<Keiichi>
"Yeah... just, you know...
 I was feeling a bit out of shape.
 So I thought I'd just try practicing my swing..."

<Rika>
"I think it's wonderful you're taking care of your health."
She was talking like an old lady, despite her appearance.
After saying that, Rika-chan started to leave again, but stopped and looked back at me once more.

<Rika>
"Please don't lose that bat."
It seems she already knew I took it out of someone's locker.
There was no name on the locker door.
I didn't know whose bat it was, but I would be borrowing it until they complained...
It wouldn't be for long; just until the gym storage shed was opened.
After quickly changing into the track suit, I checked the time.
I still had plenty of time before class began because I came so early.
I took the bat in one hand and went out to the school yard. That was, of course, to practice my swing.
I needed to make it known I would always have a bat on me so I could practice my swing.
At some point, the sunlight had become even stronger.
Disregarding my classmates as they made their way to school, I took my position in the shadow of the school building.
I wasn't the academic type and I wasn't much of an athlete either.
I might get muscle pain if I just suddenly started swinging.
I should at least start out with some warm-ups.
...I doubt anyone would think I was doing something out of the ordinary...
 Which was the exact opposite of my actual mental state.
I gripped the bat and swung lightly.
...The bat was by no means light.
The weight would make it a reliable weapon when I needed it to be.
Of course, I could only pray that the moment I needed to use this as a weapon would never come.
...Just carrying it around could deter attacks against me.
At least, that's what I hoped.

<Mion>
"Huh!?
 Kei-chan!?!?
 What are you doing!?"
Being bombarded with such a hysterical voice, I jumped.

<Rena>
"Whoa, Keiichi-kun... are you on the baseball team?
 ...The baseball team??"
It was Rena and Mion.

<Mion>
"I was surprised to hear you went off ahead... what are you doing, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"Can't you tell by looking?
 I'm practicing my swing... For the championship.
 You can say it's part of my diet if you want."

<Mion>
"...Diet? Kei-chan, are you really that fat?"

<Keiichi>
"Bet you didn't know. I actually have a beer belly.
 It's plump and jiggles."

<Rena>
"...P-Plump and jiggles..."

<Keiichi>
"...Rena, you don't have to imagine something weird like that."
To disrupt Rena from imagining something that vulgar, I ruffled her hair messily.

<Mion>
"Well then, hope you make it to regionals, at least.
 This old man will cheer you on."

<Mion>
"...Want me to tell you the best high schools for baseball?
 See Kameda-kun over there? He's a southpaw and an amazing pitcher.
 Good luck!"
Seems they've already taken me for a baseball nut, but oh well...
Well, if I really did make it to the championship, it would be a cinch.
After all, I'd be the pitcher and catcher.
I'd pitch the ball, then run past that ball I just threw and change over to being the catcher in a burst of super incredible explosive speed.
I laughed dryly at the ludicrous image...
Coming back to my senses, I smashed the bat against the ground.

<Keiichi>
"...Damn it!!!
 What am I laughing at!?"
I pounded the ground over and over.
 With each impact, the reverberation traveling through the bat stung my hands.
If they smile at me like that... I'll... I'll... ngh!!
Don't allow anyone close to me. Don't trust anyone.  No matter how many times I tell myself that... If they made me smile like that... I'll... ngh!!!
I already knew quite well that there were demons dwelling in my smiling friends!
...But... I just couldn't believe it.
Did that kind of split personality really exist...?
Like how Rena confessed to the doctor... were they simply being possessed by Oyashiro-sama...?
In other words... did a supernatural being like Oyashiro-sama really exist, and was it possessing everyone to try and kill me...?
Yeah... That would be wonderful...
If only everyone were actually my friends all along and everything was all just Oyashiro-sama's fault...

<Keiichi>
"You damned fool, Keiichi Maebara!!!!! Come on, now!"
I yelled out, drawing out all the power from the pit of my stomach, and raised the bat violently into the air.

<Keiichi>
"...Stop being so sooooooft!!!!"

As I screamed out with all my might, I beat the metal bat into the ground over and over.
With every impact, my weakness was being beaten down...
Smash.
 Forget.
 Smash.
 Don't be soft.
 Smash.
 Know your enemy.
 Smash.
 Like hell I'd let them kill me.
My shoulders heaving up and down from my ragged breathing, I heard the first bell ring just as I calmed down.
I gasped with a sudden realization.
 ...That was the final bell.
As I felt all the tension drain from me, I let out a deep breath.
My mind was in a muddled state for much of the entire day. I didn't feel like I was awake, but it didn't feel like I was asleep either.
I couldn't say it felt especially comfortable, but I felt a kind of relief that the sanctity of the school part of my daily life had yet to be violated.
How long would I have to keep on living like this...?
I could only grit my teeth and bear with it as this living hell slowly gnawed away at me.

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun!
 Come on!
 It's club time, club time!"
The sound of Rena's voice brought me back to my senses.

<Mion>
"Come on come on Kei-chan, stop spacing out!
 Bring your desk, your desk!"
Everyone was moving their desks together as usual.
That's right, it was happy fun club time.
But I had no intention of taking part.
I haphazardly stuffed the contents of my desk into my bag as I prepared to go home.
It was a weak-handed gesture to avoid having to actually say, "I'll be going home now."

<Mion>
"...What's this, Kei-chan?
 You planning on going home right away again...?"
Mion sounded quite disappointed.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm just not in the mood. Could you just let me be for a while?"
The tone of the words that spilled from my mouth matched Mion's disapproving glare.
It felt like the air in the room had dried out.
Satoko looked like she was about to say something, but perhaps dissuaded by the mood, she swallowed her words and stayed silent.
Nobody said a thing...
 I took that to mean that I could leave if I wanted...
But the collective gaze of the four of them, like the tiny pins used to mount an insect in a display, held me in place.
Rena was the one who cut through the heavy mood.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun... you just didn't like... playing with girls, I guess... I guess..."
She said it in such a melancholic tone that it sent a wave of pain racing through my heart.
If this pain was going to kill me, I wanted it to be the soft part of me that could still feel pain.
I tore at my chest, violently tearing out the pins that held me in place.

<Keiichi>
"That's not it at all...!"
I'd only be hurting myself by saying anything more, so I swallowed my words.
Cutting things off there, I turned away and exited the classroom.
They didn't speak a word to me as I left.
It was a long, dull trip back home, but I didn't lose focus.
I firmly squeezed the grip of the bat which was already soggy from sweat.
Realizing that, I wiped it down with my sleeve. If something were to happen, I wouldn't want it to be slippery.
Since this morning, I'd become especially sensitive to the presence of cars.
Even while walking, my ears pricked up, and sought out threatening sounds and presences that could be closing in...
And that was why I could hear it.
Without a doubt, there were footsteps.
Those footsteps had matched up perfectly with mine for a while now.
From what I could sense... It was just one person...
 But I had no intention of being careless.
Did they intend to follow me like that car this morning, until we were in a good location to assault me...?
Then it wasn't a good idea to keep walking like this.
I stopped walking and looked back.
The wooded path crowded with trees responded with silence as if there was nobody there to begin with.
But I wouldn't be fooled. I was certain footsteps were following me.
And just as I stopped, the footsteps stopped, as well.
...Meaning, the person following me wanted to keep their distance.
That was, without question, proof that I was their target.
I held my breath, waiting for that presence to panic and start moving again...
The trees rustled with the sound of the wind.
The higurashi also joined in the dissonant chorus, trying to throw my focus into disarray.
Had five minutes passed?
 Or had I been like this for a whole thirty minutes...?
...It was so hard to breathe that I might have suffocated; it seemed I would be the first one to panic.
Without a doubt, he was lurking in the shade of that tree with bated breath.
Then... I'd make the first move...!
I fixed my grip on the bat.
 ...I raised it up to my shoulder to be ready to swing it at any time.

<Keiichi>
"...Hey!!!
 I know you're there!!"
With all of my might, I screamed at whoever was hiding in the shade of the trees.
But... the presence in the shade didn't budge.
Until the moment I found them, they had no intention of revealing themselves...

<Keiichi>
"I know already!!!
 I know you're there!!!!"
I screamed out angrily at them again, but even still, they didn't move at all.
Then I'll go over there myself!!
With all due vigilance, I approached, step by step...
Stepping into the tree's shadow... I saw a human figure there.
That figure... was curled up like a small animal.

<Keiichi>
"Rena...!"
When she realized I had found her, her expression softened.
She seemed apologetic, but wasn't going to speak a word.

<Keiichi>
"...Did you have some business with me...!?"
I wouldn't accept that silence and screamed the question at her.

<Rena>
"N-Not really... it's just... um..."
Rena was in a panic with tears welling up in her eyes.
 But it was obvious that she had been following me.

<Keiichi>
"What about the club?"

<Rena>
"...S... Since you're not... I'm not..."

<Keiichi>
"That shouldn't matter!
 Don't mind me and just play!"

<Rena>
"...B... But... I'm just worried... about you..."
Thinking about how I'd been acting up until now, it wasn't hard to imagine that my behavior could have been perceived as strange.
So Rena was concerned... at a quick glance, that's how it would seem.
But I wasn't going to let my guard down that easily.
Even if that was really the case, she still wouldn't have to do something like try to tail me.
...She should have called out to me when I was leaving and gone out right with me.
But Rena didn't do that.
She kept her distance from me and matched my walking speed.
 On top of that, she matched the sound of her footsteps and deviously tried to hide her presence from me.
Then, after she realized I noticed she was there, she held her breath as she tried hiding from me.
She wore a timid expression that would force one to take pity on her, but without a doubt... she was tailing me.

<Keiichi>
"Stop following me."

<Rena>
"Ha... hau..."
Still glaring at Rena, I continued walking onwards.
After I'd walked for a bit, she ignored my command and began walking again... so I yelled at her once more.

<Keiichi>
"I told you not to follow me!!!"

<Rena>
"Eek!! ...B-But... My house is in the same direction...!"

<Keiichi>
"Then walk ahead of me! I'll start walking once I can't see you anymore."
I moved out of the way and waved my bat violently to urge her forward.

<Rena>
"I-I'd like... to go home together... with you..."
Making a pitiful expression, she meekly squeaked out the words in a voice that she knew would cut into my heart.
...That agitated me to no end.
I knew it was a lie.
If you wanted to go home together, then you should have called out to me.
Now you're just blurting out random lies!!!

<Rena>
"I-I'm s-s-s-s-s-sorry, I'm sorry...!!!"
It seemed that the seething anger within me was written all over my face.
...Even without me saying anything, Rena had understood what I was feeling inside.

<Keiichi>
"If you get it, then go!!"
I swung the bat, urging her again to walk.
Rena looked back and forth between me and the bat and started walking hesitantly, then stopped again.

<Keiichi>
"...Go on, then. Hurry!!"

<Rena>
"I-I'm going!
 So please stop with the bat...!!
 I-It's scary...!!!"
Rena guarded herself while pointing at me holding the bat.
She may have realized that I wasn't planning on using this bat for baseball...
I lowered the bat, but still guardedly opened the way for her.

<Keiichi>
"Go...
 There's no problem now, is there?"

<Rena>
"..."
There was nothing else she could protest.
...She passed by me timidly so as to not set me off.
As I watched her pass by, she stopped completely after having barely moved at all.

<Keiichi>
"Hey, don't stop...!"
Then, a powerful gust blew past us, barraging my face with dust.
The dust got into my eyes and clouded my vision...!
While rubbing my eyes with my left hand, I swung blindly with the bat in my right, protecting the small opening I had presented.
But Rena didn't even try to attack during that opening.
Attack me? No... She hadn't budged an inch.
I could tell from the sound of her fluttering skirt in the wind.
As her skirt settled, so did the silence.
At that moment, the voice inside of me immediately warned me of impending danger.
...I was caught by surprise.
...The smell of the air... had changed...?
Without me realizing it, the air around me suddenly felt like a calamity was about to befall me.
It was like the air had suddenly become invisible concrete. Like Rena and I were locked in this space.
Rena didn't move an inch...
 Also unable to move, I stared at her back.
Rena was the first to break the silence.
Instantly, she altered her stance.
...I felt like I had just witnessed her shift from Rena into that other person who looks like Rena.
But... The voice was one I knew well, which filled me with a kind of bewildering pity.
Carelessly, I felt relief upon hearing that pitiful voice...

<Rena>
"...Uh...
 Um...
 Well, excuse me, but...!
 ...Um, can I ask you something?"
Too shy to even turn around, Rena squeezed her voice out desperately...
 as she trembled.

<Keiichi>
"...What?"

<Rena>
"Uh...
 Umm, well...
 well...
 Wh-Why do you have a bat, I wonder...
 I wonder...?"
...The question Rena asked was by no means unexpected.

<Keiichi>
"I can carry whatever I want."

<Rena>
"But, but... you didn't have one up until today...!
 ...Wh-Why so suddenly...!?"

<Keiichi>
"It's alright if I decide to do something suddenly, isn't it?
 ...Is it strange that I have a bat?"

<Rena>
"B-Because, Keiichi... You're not the kind of person to play baseball!
 It's weird...!"
I couldn't tell what kind of answer she was looking for and I was getting tired of answering her.

<Keiichi>
"...I just suddenly got the urge to play baseball.
 Is that so weird?"

<Rena>
"It's weird...!"
She answered instantly and that annoyed me slightly.

<Keiichi>
"I just suddenly wanted to play baseball.
 And I wanted to practice my swing, so I'm carrying around a bat.
 What's strange about that?"

<Rena>
"Strange.
 Weird.
 Definitely.
 Why you too..."

<Keiichi>
"Your ramblings are annoying me...
 Is it that strange for me to have an interest in sports!?"
I tried to sound a bit more threatening to end the conversation.
Until my suspicions about Rena were cleared, I had no obligation to answer her questions.

<Rena>
"...I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry...!
 Don't get so angry...!!"
Rena still didn't turn around and spat out words of apology one after the next.

<Rena>
"J-Just one last thing!!
 Tell me one last thing...!!"

<Keiichi>
"...I don't feel like talking anymore.
 Hurry up and go!!"
I yelled loudly at her, causing her to flinch like she had been struck.
...Seeing her in such a pathetic state caused my heart to ache sorely...
But even though she was afraid, she stubbornly kept herself from moving.
Before I was able to threaten her again, Rena asked her final question.

<Rena>
"Wh-Why is even your bat the same!?!?"
What did she mean by the bat was the same?
 I had no idea what she was talking about.

<Keiichi>
"...What are you saying...?"

<Rena>
"I mean... Why is even the bat the same!?"

<Keiichi>
"I don't understand what you mean at all!
 Say it clearly!!!"
Even still, Rena didn't turn around.
 After inhaling deeply, she screamed.

<Rena>
"I mean... Why is even the bat the same as Satoshi-kun's!?!?"

<Keiichi>
"Satoshi... being...
 Huh...?
???"
Upon hearing that name out of the blue, I became dumbfounded for a brief moment.
By "Satoshi"... did she mean the student who transferred out last year?
 ...No, that couldn't be.
Rena had tried to cover it up by saying he transferred, but Ooishi-san told me quite clearly that he was missing.
He was the student who sat at my seat up until last year. He was believed to have been demoned away by Oyashiro-sama's curse.
I didn't know the details about his disappearance.
The aunt he lived with was killed the night of the Watanagashi by a drug addict, and not long after that, he suddenly vanished, and was now missing...
That Satoshi and I were... what?
My gaze fell to the bat in my hands.
...Could it be...?
"Satoshi Houjou"

It was a bit difficult to see, but that was what was written on the white tape at the end of the bat.
...I see... so this was Satoshi's bat...

<Keiichi>
"...O... Oh.
 This... was Satoshi's bat.
 ...Since nobody was using it, I borrowed it.
 That's not a problem, is it!?"

<Rena>
"Th... That's not it!!!"
The way Rena said that... made it seem like this bat was something that should never be touched.
Like it was some sort of offering at a shrine... or a memento of the deceased...
I could only stand there, perplexed and unable to respond. Rena continued speaking without waiting for a reply.

<Rena>
"...Why is it...
 Why is it...
 that you're doing the exact same thing Satoshi-kun did when it happened to him!?"
Rena was talking about more than just the bat belonging to Satoshi.

<Rena>
"...It was the same with Satoshi-kun!!

<Rena>
He joined a baseball team... but he didn't really like baseball...!"

<Keiichi>
"What does that have to do with me...?"

<Rena>
"Satoshi-kun also... suddenly started walking around with a bat one day!!!!
 He joined a team... but he wasn't the type to play sports...!!"
What about it...!?
 I closed my mouth before I could say that out loud.
...Listen carefully, Keiichi!
Rena is trying to tell us something important...

<Rena>
"Satoshi-kun also... one day came to school all by himself all of a sudden.
 Just like Keiichi-kun!!!

<Rena>
Then one day, he suddenly started practicing his swing.
 Just like Keiichi-kun!!!

<Rena>
Then one day, he suddenly began carrying the bat around with him.
 Just like Keiichi-kun!!!

<Rena>
Then one day, he suddenly...
 Gh..."
...Then one day he suddenly... what!?
Rena had swallowed her words.
Rena's sudden silence brought a hush back to the surrounding area.
...It was then that I could finally digest the content of the entire conversation.
She was saying my chain of actions... was exactly the same as Satoshi's.
What was... the meaning of this!?
Up until just now, I'd forgotten all about Satoshi.
I had never paid much thought to him in the first place.
Not only that, I didn't even know anything of what he'd done.
My actions today should have been my own creation, after all the planning I had done.
But...they... had been the exact same as Satoshi's...?
Then Satoshi... no, more importantly...!!
If both Satoshi and I acted the same, then there was a really good possibility that what happened after would be the same...

<Keiichi>
"Rena... that day... what happened to Satoshi!?"
Rena knew...
 She knew what became of Satoshi.
 No, forget about what happened to a guy in the past!
Rena... knew what was going to happen... to me!!!

<Keiichi>
"A-Answer me, Rena!!
 Satoshi... What happened to him!?"
With that, I grabbed Rena's shoulder violently and forcibly turned her around to face me.
As I faced her, I felt a jolt travel through my entire body...!!

<Rena>
"I told you...
 Keiichi-kun."
It was that person that I didn't know.
At least, it definitely wasn't the Rena Ryuugu I'd been talking to up until now.
The voice just now didn't have a trace of the trembling or emotion that it had had before.
...The amount of regret I felt for turning her around so carelessly was unsurpassed...!
That gaze that pierced like a cold needle... The smile on her face that invoked an image of having been carved out by a knife...
Chills went down my spine... My mind froze under a layer of rime.
Both of Rena's eyes pierced through mine, leaving me unable to look away.
...As if to remind me of the fear from that time before... Rena brought her face close to mine, so close that I could feel her breath.
...Her face had filled my entire field of vision.
...Then... her sharply-shaped lips grew even sharper. Like the curve of a crescent moon...
 she grinned.

<Rena>
"I told you.
 Keiichi-kun."
After a short pause, Rena repeated the same words again.

<Rena>
"Satoshi-kun, you see...
 transferred out."
Transferred... meaning what...?
...What Rena meant must have been some new definition of 'transfer' that I was previously not aware of...
My throat and lips dried up, I couldn't even acknowledge what I had just heard.
All... I could do was swallow down my own saliva...
...It would seem that Rena saw that as a nod.
She pulled her gaze back and spryly stepped back two, three paces.
As she did, my legs gave out and I fell to my knees pathetically.
...Rena, and me on my knees underneath her emotionless smile...
That had to be a very odd sight indeed...
Seeing me in that pathetic state, she neither scoffed at me nor held out her hand.
But I could neither stand nor escape with her gaze shooting through my eyes.
There was undoubtedly a metal bat in my hand.
But right now, it was useless to me. I was like a fly caught in her web.
Heavy sweat beaded all over my body, I could feel it dripping from my skin...

<Rena>
"...But you won't, will you,
 Keiichi-kun...?"
...Rena finally released me from that cage of time after what felt like an eternity.
But her question was missing something important and was incredibly vague.
Once again I swallowed hard, urging her on.

<Keiichi>
"...D... Do what...?"
What did she not want me to do...?

<Rena>
"Transfer."




[Onikakushi Ch.13]

Satoshi and I... had what?
All my well-planned actions throughout the day turned out to have been nothing more than a reenactment of what Satoshi had done.
Satoshi... had he really been in the same situation as I was now...?
The friends he had gotten along with had changed suddenly... and for no reason (at least none that I had noticed), planned to kill him...?
Then, fearing for his life as I am, he got a bat to protect himself, and carried it around every day to practice his swing?
And then one day, suddenly...
"He transferred."
My blood went cold, causing a prickling sensation to course through my veins.
Starting near my heart, it radiated outwards, from the top of my head to the soles of my feet... chilling every part of me without recourse.
What did she mean by transfer?
 What did she mean by transfer?
 Was Satoshi still at wherever he transferred to?
Was he the only one who would be able to understand me?
Would he be able to tell me why it all ended up like this?
More importantly, where did he transfer to!?
What did she mean by transfer?
 What did she mean by transfer...?
Before I knew it, I was at my front door.
The frigid knob was hard to turn.
 ...Was nobody home?
It wasn't that odd of an occurrence. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the single key attached to my fur seal keychain.
I stepped into the entryway. Just as I was about to take off my shoes, a chill ran down my spine.
...Someone had entered right behind me.
Like a classmate messing around... standing right up against my back...
You're kidding, right...?
 It had to be my imagination...
Logically speaking, it was impossible for someone to be able to hide their presence within my personal space all the way through the door.
But there was undoubtedly someone behind me.
...Hey now, hey now, Keiichi.
...How do you know they're 'there' even though they're behind you...!?
...Because... I could hear the sound of flowing hair.
There's no other reason... I'd hear that sound.
 That was the presence.
...Because... I could hear the sound of them blinking.
Keiichi Maebara, there's no way you could hear that!
My most base instincts were warning me of the presence. Common sense was telling me that it was just my imagination.
It was just my imagination, there was nobody behind me. I began to erase the mental image of an eerie figure standing behind me.
But at the same time, I asked myself... if there was 'nobody,' then what was I feeling...? As an uncomfortable sensation crawled up my spine.
Actually... wouldn't it be better if there was somebody there...?
If... there was nobody there when you turned around... would you be able to accept that...?
I'd be able to answer all those questions just by looking behind me.
...But... I didn't have enough courage... to even do that simple task...
Oh, right... I could try speaking to them...
 The person behind me... might answer me.
It was a random thought... I didn't care how I went about it, just so long as I didn't have to turn around.
...If I had calmed down and thought about it... I would have known that that wouldn't have solved anything.

<Keiichi>
"Wh... Who is it...?"
I spoke in such a hoarse, broken voice that I couldn't believe it was my own.
I could almost feel them contemplating their response.
...I felt it. There's no way I should be able to do that!
Calm down, Keiichi. It's all in your head...!
That time, I was certain I heard it.
As if hesitantly trying to answer my inquiry... I was certain I could hear the sound of somebody inhaling.
I heard it.
I heard it.
I heard it clearly.
It was a girl.
A young girl.
I didn't know who, but...
A tiny speck of courage in me —however reckless it was— inspired a primal yet fitting solution to this current predicament: a scream.
All the force in my body released from my lungs and through my throat, ceasing all thought processes in my head.
Suppressing all my thoughts and emotions, I began to collapse like a house of cards, somehow managing to twist my body and look back as I did so.
It was definitely there.
Right there.
Somebody was there.
Until the moment I turned around, until I brought the area behind me into my field of vision, they were definitely there.
Falling face-up, my eyes traced the remnants of the presence suspended in the empty space...
...It couldn't be... They were invisible... They looked like they weren't there... But were they actually still standing there...???
As I screamed, all the emotions I was holding back burst free in a violent wave.
However, I was decidedly calm as my emotional dam collapsed.
...The turbulent wave of pent-up emotions was skillfully diverted... into a torrent of aggression.
That emotion was definitely required to extricate myself from the bizarre situation happening right in front of me.
In my state of heightened lucidity, I entrusted my body to the fury...
The metal bat held firm in my right hand as if drawn there by a magnet.
A mid-level sweep would be the hardest attack to dodge... I remembered reading something like that from a book about swordsmanship or something.

<Keiichi>
"RAaaAAaAAaAh!!!!!"
I brandished my will to fight.
The afterimage of that amalgamation of metal flashed as it swung from left to right, beating against the entryway!!!!
The bat slammed into the right wall, the tip rebounding violently.
...Very calmly, I transferred the force of the rebound into a sweep to the left.
The door of the shoe cupboard was split into pieces.
Those two swings whiffed through empty space, but they seemed to have a great psychological impact on the enemy.
...I could feel the panic emanating from that space.
The attack wasn't the only thing required.
...I extracted the bat from the cupboard it was embedded in and screamed as I spun my entire body around in a large arc.

<Keiichi>
"WRAaAAAAaAAaAAAhhh!!!"
My screams shook the air, imbuing my ferocious swing with even more destructive power...!!!
Crrraaaaak!!!!
Without mercy or restraint, my violent strike—with certainly fatal force behind it—shattered the top of the cupboard.
None of my attacks struck the enemy, but my ferocity had certainly seemed to impact them.
Breathing heavily, my entire body soaked in sweat, the invisible enemy—there, but not there—dispersed.
When I was certain that the enemy had retreated, I locked the front door and latched the chain.
No way, had it only feigned retreat and was now inside my house!?!?
Once again, I channeled my aggression and searched the house for the presence...
 but it was gone.
I had succeeded in fending it off.
...At that moment, the tension drained from my body and I let out a deep sigh of relief...
All of the emotions I'd been holding back chaotically merged together and began to flood out. A hodgepodge of fear, accomplishment, and disbelief all mixed together and began to flow through my body.
Unable to deal with each individual feeling, I beat them all back with the strongest: exhaustion.
Even in this moment... I remained composed.
After checking that all the doors throughout the house were locked, I went up to my room on the second floor and closed the curtains.
I straightened my back and tilted my head back a little... After clearing my mind of all my idle thoughts, I managed to calm down even more...
What was that at the front door...?
There was definitely something there.
Thinking about it, maybe it was just an apparition I dreamt up in my confused state... but I really didn't think that was the case.
Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...
 Compose yourself...
But no matter how calmly I thought about it... what just happened wasn't a figment of my imagination.
It was obviously a supernatural phenomenon. And without a doubt, something was behind me.
It wasn't some sort of illusion I saw amidst my confusion and disorientation!
Proof?
 I had just one piece.
...When I asked "Who is it?" they inhaled as if they were about to answer.
 That 'sound' had clearly reached my ears.
The situation I was in right now was still unclear.
Either I'd been possessed by the supernatural phenomenon known as Oyashiro-sama's curse...
Or this was a ruse by the villagers who believed in it and were imitating it.
Either way, their motives were unclear.
The roundabout way it had been done was also still a mystery.
If it was perpetrated by humans, that would mean admitting that it was Rena and the rest of them doing it, but it would be solvable.
Ooishi-san and the rest of the police would surely arrest my enemy.
But... If it was a manifestation of Oyashiro-sama's curse... I wondered what would happen...?
Ooishi-san very clearly declared that curses didn't exist.
At that time, those words were pretty dependable... but as things were now, with the rising possibility that the perpetrators were not human... He suddenly seemed quite unreliable.
If I told Ooishi-san this was the work of Oyashiro-sama's curse... what would happen?
...I couldn't imagine his reaction, but it would go without question that a void would expand rapidly between myself and Ooishi-san.
With me having so few allies to begin with and not being able to confidently declare whether or not this was a curse, there was no merit to doing that.
I'd better keep the 'facts' of what just happened at the doorway to myself.
...It would be better if I didn't add what happened here to the memo behind the clock.
There was still the ever so slight possibility...
 that I was actually confused when I thought I was composed, and I was just going berserk in the entryway.
How wonderful would that be if that was really what happened?
I would be able to refute Oyashiro-sama's curse.
But if I denied Oyashiro-sama's curse, then that would mean admitting that Rena and the rest were the perpetrators.
If I said that Rena and the rest weren't the perpetrators, then that would mean believing in Oyashiro-sama's curse.
By denying both of those... I would be admitting that I myself was losing it.
The three options from which I couldn't choose became a trilemma of sorts. They mixed together and formed a whirlpool in my mind, making my head spin...
Once again, I straightened myself and leaned my head back slightly to cool myself down.
...Calm down, Keiichi.
...Accept what has actually happened as reality.
...Stop thinking of anything more than that...
But... I couldn't help but think of it.
...How wonderful it would be... if it turned out I was delirious and everything up until now was a figment of my imagination.
Oyashiro-sama's curse wouldn't exist and I would still be bestest buddies with Rena and the rest...
I would have to be crazy.
That was the first time in my life I'd ever wished for such a thing.
The phone rang noisily downstairs.
Generally there were no calls for me, so I never really answered the phone much.
But since my parents weren't here, I had no choice.
I squirmed off the bed and went downstairs.

<Keiichi>
"Hello, this is the Maebara residence."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi? This is Mom."
...I intuitively had a bad feeling about this.
 It was because I thought she was going to ask me to go out and buy some things.
So I took the initiative.

<Keiichi>
"What?
 I don't mind having instant noodles for dinner.
 There's still a lot of them."
The other day, we went out as a family and bought a whole case of cup noodles.
I wanted to get a bunch of different kinds, actually, but they refused since the individual packs were expensive. So instead, I got a whole case of the Mega-size Pork-bone & Ginger flavored ones I liked.
But my parents don't like strong flavors and didn't touch any of them. So the cupboards were still full of them.

<Keiichi>
"So you see, there really isn't a need to go shopping, right?"

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi, I'm not asking you to go shopping.
 Both Mommy and Daddy have to go to Tokyo right now because of work."

<Keiichi>
"Huh...!?
 Right now!?"
This was really... abrupt.

<Keiichi's mom>
"No, we're already here.
 We left this afternoon."
It's quite a distance to Tokyo from Hinamizawa.
 Gunning it full speed down the highway, would still take six hours.
...Dad has a license, but since he doesn't like the highway they likely took the train...
 It would have taken longer.

<Keiichi's mom>
"I'm thinking you might understand since you heard us speaking last night, but it has to do with Daddy's contract. Right now, things aren't going so smoothly."
Now that she mentioned it, I did remember that they talked all that time about how his job prospects weren't looking so good.

<Keiichi's mom>
"Daddy is really sensitive about things like this, so if we leave things as they are, it will affect his work."
Part of my father's particular fragile artistic personality: his emotions changed as easily as the fall sky.
 ...You could also just say he couldn't take criticism.

<Keiichi>
"But... something like that can be done over the phone!"

<Keiichi's mom>
"Keiichi... This is your father's job, so can you support him a bit, please?
 Anyway, it's just faster to talk about it in person,
 so there wouldn't be any misunderstandings."
As their son, there was nothing more I could say once they started talking about work.

<Keiichi's mom>
"So, we'll be back tomorrow night.
 Keiichi, will you be fine on your own?"

<Keiichi>
"It's not like I'll die or anything."

<Keiichi's mom>
"...Keiichi, you shouldn't speak so lightly of dying...
 If there's something troubling you, just talk to us.
 I believe Mommy will be able to help out."
Yesterday I did bring up "If I died" rather abruptly, so I supposed they were a little worried.
...But really, I was more depressed by the fact that nothing would be solved by telling them.
But I didn't plan on dying...
...At least not while I still knew nothing... I would never allow it.

<Keiichi>
"I won't die.
 I won't...
 I'll survive even if I have to gnaw my leg off."

<Keiichi's mom>
"Yeah...
 See you then.
 Tomorrow morning, make sure to wake up.
 And eat your breakfast.

<Keiichi's mom>
And don't forget to take a bath and brush your teeth."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, yeah... see you."
The call ended like that.
...Sometimes my parents went off to Tokyo for business meetings.
 But Tokyo was far away.
They normally did things by phone...
The times they did go were normally planned out in advance, it never happened this suddenly.
I couldn't say that those circumstances didn't feel strange, or rather... unnatural.
Anyway... I only needed to recognize the reality of the situation...
...That tonight... I was the only one in the house.
 That when my parents came back from work, I'd be gone... missing.
Vanished.
...Looking back on the series of events of the previous five years involving Oyashiro-sama's curse, it wouldn't seem that strange at all.
Come to think of it... it was getting pretty late.
I didn't think it was good that the only light on in the whole house was from my room on the second floor.
It was the same as broadcasting to the enemy that my parents were gone and this was their chance.
First I ran to the living room, flicked on the lights, and turned the TV on to a reassuring volume.
Next was the study. I similarly turned on the lights and some music.
With this, from the outside it would look like my parents were here.
Once again, I went through the house, checking to see if there was anything left unlocked...
...When I saw the veranda and the laundry still hanging out there, I went pale.
That would have made it too obvious! I needed to take it down...!!
I snatched down the laundry haphazardly and erased all traces that my mother wasn't there.
 It should be fine now...
 ...Ah!
 The garage!!
They hadn't gone all the way to Tokyo by car, but they had gone up to Okinomiya station.
The garage was empty, wide open, and in plain sight... this was not good!!
I panicked and rushed out the back to close the normally-open garage door.
 It should be fine now...
 Ah, I needed to get the paper!! 
Mom always got the paper. Since they left in the afternoon... The evening paper was still out there!!
My premonition was correct.
 I pulled out everything from the mailbox and dropped it in the entryway.
...With this... for sure this time... it should be fine...
Come to think of it... Leaving the cupboard busted like that from my little freak-out was kind of bad.
I'll just say I tripped and fell, and the bat I was holding smashed into it...
Even so, just leaving it in its current state wasn't good.
 I should clean it up a little before Mom got back and scolded me.
I remembered that there was a broom and dust pan in the closet. As I was going to get them, the phone rang once again.

<Keiichi>
"Hello, this is the Maebara residence."

<Villager>
"Oh, is this Keiichi-kun?
 Is your mother around?"

<Keiichi>
"A-Ah, she isn't here at the moment..."
You idiot, Keiichi Maebara!!
 Don't reveal that your parents are gone...!!
 You can follow up still... Calm down and take care of it...!

<Keiichi>
"I-I think she'll be back soon...!!"
That wasn't a good response either...!
Now they might say they'll call again, or to tell her to call them when she comes back!!

<Villager>
"Then that's fine.
 It wasn't anything important...
 Well then, sorry for the bother."
The scenario I feared didn't play out, eliciting a sigh of relief.
That call was fortunate in more ways than one.
...I'd have to deal with any telephone calls coming in for my parents tonight.
I was somehow able to deal with the phone call just now... But I couldn't continue to rely on such poor improvisation.
I needed to make up a good story to explain that my parents were home but couldn't answer the phone at the moment.
They were making tempura and couldn't step away right now...
 That wasn't good enough.
They were sick and went to bed because they weren't feeling well.
 ...Was that going to be safe enough?
I was thinking about it on the way back to my room when the phone rang once again.
It was like they were calling because they knew I was going to lie.
I didn't want to pick up...
 but I knew I had to.
 They'd suspect my parents weren't here.
...I should have just taken the phone off the hook under the pretense that I didn't realize that it was...
But since the phone rang, I had to pick it up.
I prepared myself and lifted up the receiver...

<Keiichi>
"Hello..."
I stopped announcing this was the Maebara residence. I had no reason to be kind to someone I didn't know the identity of...
But unlike my uncouth voice, the person on the other side sounded goofy and lighthearted.

<Ooishi>
"Hello, my apologies for calling so late.
 This is Ooishi from the Okinomiya bookstore."

<Keiichi>
"Ooishi-san!?"

<Ooishi>
"Is that you, Maebara-san?
 Good evening. Good to hear you are doing well."

<Keiichi>
"W-Wait just a moment, please!"
I grabbed the portable handset and rushed up to my room with it.
It was the same no matter where I was since there was no one else home... but I wanted to be in a spot that just felt a bit safer when speaking on the phone with Ooishi-san.

<Keiichi>
"S-Sorry for the wait."

<Ooishi>
"How are things? Anything change since then?"
Since then... when was that exactly?
...There was something about the brazen way he talked that rubbed me the wrong way.
The last time I spoke with Ooishi-san was... two days ago.
 The day I stayed home from school, I met Ooishi-san on the way back from the hospital... and we headed into town for lunch and had a talk...
...Then after that, Rena and Mion came to check up on me.
Whenever I spoke with Ooishi-san... they always knew about it.
It was like that since the first time I met him.
Today's phone call may well be found out by them as well...

<Ooishi>
"Hello...?
 Can you hear me, Maebara-san?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 Ah, sorry...
 Um... what did you say?"

<Ooishi>
"I asked if anything's changed since last time...
 There wasn't an answer, so I got a bit worried."

<Keiichi>
"Uh, um... not really..."
The words stopped in my throat.
There was a ton of stuff that happened.
 All of it baffling.
What should I talk about...? I didn't understand any of it... but I should try asking.
If I didn't ask now, I may never have another chance.
...This night when my parents weren't home... I had no guarantees I would make it through the night safely, after all.

<Keiichi>
"Well, Ooishi-san... it seems that... someone is after me."

<Ooishi>
"Really!?"

<Keiichi>
"...It could all just be a coincidence... but that day I missed school when I was sick, the two of them came to check up on me."

<Ooishi>
"Which two?"

<Keiichi>
"Rena and Mion.
 They started asking about how I had lunch with you."

<Ooishi>
"...What next?"

<Keiichi>
"They left me some mochi when they came to visit... but there was a needle inside.
 Fortunately, I somehow didn't swallow it...
 I wonder, could that have just been a threat...?"

<Ooishi>
"About the needle..."

<Keiichi>
"...Um, it was just one of those common sewing needles you see all the time.
 There was a hole to thread string through..."

<Ooishi>
"Not that, Maebara-san, the needle itself...
 That's evidence.
 It could be used as proof that they threatened you.
 Where is that needle?"
...Th-That's right... That's it!!!!
I dropped the receiver and rushed downstairs.
When I tossed the mochi, I had overlooked it out of terror... but that needle was a valuable piece of evidence!
Let's see... I threw the mochi and needle at the wall together.
 If it was there... then it would be on the living room wall!
But my prudent mother had cleaned that living room wall, and there was not a trace of mochi left on it.
Could it be that it dropped in the gap between the wall and the carpet!?
I frantically searched by running my palm along the carpet, but nothing turned up.
I tried moving around the sofa and desks, pulling up the carpet, then flapping it around.
But I couldn't find the needle...!
Did my mom clean up everything without noticing it!?
It was just two days ago. I didn't know what day they collected the burnable trash, but it may still be in the trash bin in the kitchen!!
I rushed into the kitchen, opened up the lid of the pail, and poured out the contents.
But... even at a glance, I could tell that it would be incredibly difficult to find the needle in this pile of trash.
I was looking for a needle in a trashstack.
I know. I'll try running my hand through it.
It was a bit gross, but I was looking for a needle.
 If I felt a small prick, I'll be able to find it!
It was a pretty tactless method, but it was the quickest.
I held my breath and started striking the pile of trash with my hand.
Filth flew about. There was nothing more disgusting than this, but it was not the time to be concerned about such details!
...I continued on for a while, but nothing turned up.
I wanted to search more thoroughly, but I was still on the phone.
 I shouldn't keep Ooishi-san waiting for too long...
Later, when Mom got back, I'd have to ask her if there was a needle.
I hastily began scribbling on the note pad affixed to the refrigerator with a magnet.
"Was there a needle!?"
I scrawled the words with a red pen.
I then dashed back up the stairs, where I had been keeping Ooishi-san waiting for far too long.

<Ooishi>
"Hello?
 How did it go?"

<Keiichi>
"...I couldn't find it...
 I was really overwhelmed when it happened and..."

<Ooishi>
"...I see.
 It would be great if you could find it.
 Keep it safe."
That's right. The needle wasn't the only incident.
 I had to tell him about this morning with the hit-and-run.

<Keiichi>
"A-Also, Ooishi-san, that isn't all.
 ...Actually, this morning..."
...That van was definitely aiming for me. I could say that without question due to the circumstances at that time.

<Ooishi>
"Did you see the license plate?
 I can search for it from here."
Damn...!!
At the time, I just flipped out yelling at him, but I didn't look at the plate...
What failures on my part with the needle and the plate number!
I was so focused just protecting myself, that I let some of the most important details slip out of my grasp...!
I punched my pillow, annoyed at how worthless I was.

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm sorry... I don't know much more than that it was a white van..."

<Ooishi>
"Nothing to fret about, Maebara-san.
 Anyone would be shaken up after being hit."

<Keiichi>
"...I guess all of this really... isn't a coincidence, is it?"

<Ooishi>
"..."
Ooishi-san started to hem and haw over on the other end.
I could imagine him folding his arms...

<Keiichi>
"Also... Rena is acting strange."

<Ooishi>
"...How so?"
What Rena said on the way home today...
 Asking why I was so much like Satoshi-kun.
Now I could say it with confidence...
That Rena knew what happened to Satoshi.
...She knew that there was more to it than him just simply disappearing.

<Keiichi>
"...Rena... knows.
 She knows something regarding what happened to Satoshi, the kid who was demoned away last year..."

<Ooishi>
"What would that be exactly...?"

<Keiichi>
"...Rena said... I was the same as Satoshi.
 She said something to the effect that the way things are going... I'll end up with the same fate as Satoshi..."

<Ooishi>
"'Fate,' you say...
 Exactly what kind of 'fate' did she say would befall you?"

<Keiichi>
"...Um... 'transferring out'... she said."

<Ooishi>
"'Transferring out'?"

<Keiichi>
"Rena said Satoshi 'transferred' out.
 ...So given how things are going with me, I'll 'transfer out,' too..."
Ooishi-san let out a stern sigh and then grumbled loudly.

<Ooishi>
"...Maebara-san, that was probably some sort of threat...
 or maybe some type of warning."

<Keiichi>
"I thought so too..."
At that point... I started to think.
Would it be prudent to sum up everything that had happened up until now as the machinations of some human perpetrator?
Other than the theory of it being Rena and the others, I was left with Oyashiro-sama's curse actually existing as the only explanation...
Of course, I couldn't tell that to Ooishi-san.
Except... Rena's strange behavior could be proof of either scenarios.
Whether it was Oyashiro-sama's curse being real or everything being part of a conspiracy committed by all of the villagers...
Rena was involved...
Rena had to know something.
 Rena was suspicious.
 What exactly was Rena?
I couldn't help but think she was somehow involved with the prior string of mysterious deaths...
I seemed to recall that Ooishi-san had admitted that he had... "dug into Rena's past a little."
He was probably just downplaying it when he said "a little."
...Meaning he had actually dug pretty deep, most likely.
...I wanted to hear about Rena.
I wanted to know what happened at her previous school... among other things that were still unknown to me.
If Rena... was somebody I should suspect...
 No... not that.
...I wanted to know the truth.
Tonight, I was alone in this huge house.
...Even though I said I couldn't count on them, I had lost the security I felt I had just by my parents being around.
It wasn't like this house was some sort of fortress or castle.
...If a malicious person decided to use brute force, they'd easily gain entry.
There were no other residences close to the Maebara residence.
 No one would be able to hear anything, no matter how loud it was.
I had never felt as much resentment towards my father's artistic temperament and the fact that he had this house built in such a remote location as I did right now...
...I wondered if I would still be here by tomorrow morning...
So I had to ask.
 Right now.
 Because I had no idea when the next chance would come.

<Keiichi>
"Um... Ooishi-san, I have something I wanted to ask about...
 Please don't keep anything from me."

<Ooishi>
"Sure. Ask away."
Even though he was so far away on the other end of the line, this was the most reliable he had ever felt.
I wanted to ask...
About Rena...
About what happened at her previous school...!

<Keiichi>
"...Actually... regarding Rena's—"
I noticed a sound that had been going on for a while now.
Since I was so focused on the call, I hadn't paid attention to it at first... but I finally realized it was the doorbell.
The time was... 7 o'clock.
It was past the time the postman would be making a delivery, and past any sensible time for a neighbor to be visiting.
I considered just acting like nobody was home, but that wouldn't be good.
That would ruin all the work I put in making it look like my parents were home.
I need to answer the door.

<Ooishi>
"...Hello? Maebara-san?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, sorry, someone seems to be at the door. I'm going to go see who it is."

<Ooishi>
"A guest? I see, my apologies.
 Should we end this phone call now?"
That would be a problem!

<Keiichi>
"Ah, no, I'll be back in a second!
 Do you mind if I just leave the phone on!?"

<Ooishi>
"...It's fine. I don't mind."
I dropped the handset on my bed and dashed down to the door.
I needed to make up a good excuse to get them to leave.
I had a hunch it was the lady who called right before Ooishi-san did.
...In which case it would be one of the neighbors who's friends with my mom.
I'll just say Mom isn't feeling well and went to bed early...
 That would be the easiest option.
It'd be hard for her to ask me to wake my mom up if she's not feeling well.
The bell continued to ring at regular intervals.
...If someone didn't answer after you rang the bell so much, you'd normally give up and go home, wouldn't you...?
Without removing the chain, I opened the door slightly... and peered out at the visitor.
...A chill ran down my spine.
I knew it.
...Somewhere deep inside, I had prepared for this moment.
...I had tried to 'escape' by imagining it was the easiest person to deal with: one of my mom's friends.

<Rena>
"...Good evening."

<Keiichi>
"R... Rena..."
There shouldn't be any reason for Rena to come over at this hour.
The timing also made me feel uneasy.
...Because it was just as I was about to ask Ooishi-san about Rena.
I wish I could have chalked this up to mere coincidence.
But... those unsettling words from Mion several days ago echoed back to me...

<Mion>
"...There's nothing
 this old man doesn't know."

<Keiichi>
"A-Are you alone, Rena...?"

<Rena>
"...Yeah."
It seems that Mion wasn't with her...
 But that didn't change the situation at all.

<Keiichi>
"Why did you come here...?"

<Rena>
"...Hey, Keiichi-kun, I'd like you to open the door so we can talk...
 Can I come inside, I wonder? ...I wonder?"
It was true that speaking through a chained door wasn't the right way to talk to a classmate.
 But...

<Keiichi>
"At my house, the chain has to be on at night.
 Don't worry about it."

<Rena>
"...
 Then... it can't be helped, I guess."
Rena looked at the ground sadly.
But she kept smiling at least, and her effort to keep that smile up was quite pitiful.
...Even though she was tugging at my heartstrings, I didn't lower my guard.
As long as I stayed like this, even if it made my heart ache, my life wasn't in danger.
What I really feared... more than the possibility that hoodlums would assault me if I removed the chain...
 was trusting Rena enough to remove the chain... and having my friendship betrayed.
As long as the chain wasn't unlatched... even if it made my heart ache, I wouldn't have to deal with being betrayed by Rena.
Since it didn't seem like I'd remove the chain from her silent urging, she appeared to give up on trying to get into the entranceway.

<Rena>
"...Um, have you... eaten yet, Keiichi-kun?"
No, I haven't eaten.
Since my mom wasn't there, dinner wouldn't be ready no matter how long I waited.
I laid down when I got home, was woken up by the phone, and didn't have a chance to eat since I used up all that time talking.
...I was going to have cup noodles in any case. I could just eat one whenever I wanted to.

<Keiichi>
"...No... not yet.
 What about it?"

<Rena>
"H-Heheheh, then good☆
 Look here.
 I brought a bunch of dishes."
Rena held out a stack of boxes wrapped in a cloth.

<Rena>
"I-If I could use your kitchen, I can heat up the miso soup and other stuff.☆"

<Keiichi>
"It's fine, you don't need to do that..."

<Rena>
"But... but, there's a lot of tofu and vegetables in it!
 Does Keiichi-kun not like that type of stuff, I wonder? ...I wonder?"
There's no way I wouldn't like that.
I love miso soup with lots of ingredients.
White radish, carrots, burdock root and potatoes... Dense and fibrous root vegetables...
 Yeah... that miso soup... looks incredible.

<Rena>
"I also brought rice, so if you microwave it, it'll be ready to eat in no time.☆"
Without a doubt, rice needs miso soup!
 Stuffing rice down your gullet, sipping miso soup in between ravenous bites...
 Oh, yes, how wonderful it is to be born Japanese...!!

<Rena>
"Also... I made some more pickles☆
 I made sansai pickles this time!"
Before I had moved here to Hinamizawa, I scoffed at the mountain vegetables called sansai.
But... I was captivated by their charm the first time I tried them!
Such a deep, yet light, flavor.
Those so-called supermarket vegetables taste rough and overpowering in comparison!
If you had to describe them, then they were the vegetables for the uninitiated.
To become an expert such as myself, you first had to partake of sansai.
It was common knowledge around here that the Ryuugu family's traditional pickles were wonderfully delicious!
...Ahh, no matter what kind of pickles they were...
They'd go so well with that fluffy white rice...!!

<Rena>
"...And also... And also...!"
But wait, there's more!!
So delicious... It just seems so delicious!!
Farewell to my unhealthy self who said he'd make do with cup noodles!
Rena appeared to be in good spirits and she was offering such a delicious-sounding dinner.
...The stress evaporated from my gut and hunger reared its voracious head...
At the same time, my wariness of Rena suddenly dwindled...
Rena did say she was alone... It shouldn't be a problem letting her inside...
Though, the possibility that it was laced with poison still hadn't been ruled out...
...At that moment, a cold chill ran down my spine once again.
I couldn't understand why such a sensation had occurred just then.
...But... the voice inside me... was sounding the alarm.
...This happy Rena speaking of this charming dinner... was dependent on one premise.
And that premise was that tonight, dinner hadn't been made at my house...
 Meaning it was under the assumption that my mom, who should be making it, wasn't here.
At any normal household, 7 o'clock would be around the middle of dinner time.
If my mom were here, we'd be eating dinner around this time as well.
The fact that she brought over all the makings of a meal at this time was inherently strange.
...Unless she knew...
Rena...
 Did she...
 Did she know that my parents weren't home?
But... there was also the chance that this was a bluff.
...I had turned on the lights and a bunch of other stuff to make it seem like my parents were here.
...There was a chance that Rena was unsure if my parents were home.
But... I had to wonder...
 The laundry, the garage, the evening paper...
 There were plenty of signs of them being hastily tidied up.
...It was hard to say that Rena didn't have a chance to determine if my parents were here or not...
But... there was no reason for me to confess that right now...
I should try holding on to that fact as long as I could...
First of all, the chain was still latched.
As long as I didn't take it off, Rena wouldn't be able to do anything to me...

<Keiichi>
"I... I'm quite grateful... but dinner will be ready pretty soon."

<Rena>
"Huh...?
 Is that so?
 Is that so...?"

<Keiichi>
"...I know you went through all the effort and everything but... well..."
Unable to think of a good way to refuse, my words trailed off weakly...

<Rena>
"But... some of this could work as side dishes, I think... I think."

<Keiichi>
"I'm sorry... We have more than enough already...
 My mom always makes quite a few sides.
 So..."

<Rena>
"Huh...? You have side dishes?"
With a smile that bordered on a cringe, I dodged her questions apologetically...
But... the feeling I tried to ignore... began creeping up my back again.
I spoke as if my mom was setting down dinner right now... but it didn't mesh well with what Rena was saying.
Rena was talking as if she was aware of some obvious fact.
And that... I was aware of it as well.

<Rena>
"So Keiichi-kun can cook.
 What did you make, I wonder?"

<Keiichi>
"...N-No, well... It's not that I..."
Rena had assumed out of nowhere that I had made the dishes.
No... not so much that I'd made them... but rather that my mom hadn't.

<Rena>
"...Did you really make them?
 The side dishes?
 Did you, Keiichi-kun?"

<Keiichi>
"I-It wasn't me... who made them...
 My mom did... no, she's making them...
 Right now!"

<Rena>
"..."

<Keiichi>
"So you see... I'm sorry, but I can't eat what you brought..."
Rena fell silent at that moment.
 At that moment... I felt that the light had suddenly disappeared from her eyes.

<Rena>
"...How about I try guessing what Keiichi-kun's dinner will be?"

<Keiichi>
"I-It... doesn't matter what I'm going to eat..."

<Rena>
"...Let's see..."
The conversation might appear natural at first glance, but Rena was firmly in control.
...It felt like I was being interrogated.

<Rena>
"...Your dinner... I wonder, is it something that can be made with just hot water?"

<Keiichi>
"H-Hey, now, stop with the insults!
 I can't believe you'd belittle my mom's extravagant dinner like that...!!
 Tickets sold out, full capacity already... It's that amazing..."
I tried my best to put on a strong front, but I couldn't grit my teeth quite right.
...So instead, I looked like someone who was borderline hysterical...
But Rena showed no reaction whatsoever, even to that silliness.

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun...
 Did your mother... really leave you dinner...?"

<Keiichi>
"No, you see, she didn't leave me dinner... she's making it right now!
 It's almost time for dinner...!"
Rena had taken that assertion of mine... that my mother was home and making dinner right now... and was completely ignoring it.
I could tell that the more I panicked... the colder Rena became.

<Rena>
"Hey, Keiichi-kun."
...At that moment, an uncomfortable chill crept in from the gap in the doorway...

<Rena>
"Is your mom... home, I wonder?
 ...
I wonder?"
I couldn't... keep up this charade anymore.
Rena...
 She knew full well that my parents weren't home.
But... I'd come too far to admit that now.
Anyway... my parents were here and we'd be having dinner soon... that was the situation I had concocted...!!
So I answered...
I told her she was here.

<Keiichi>
"S-She's here... Of course...!"
I could feel the humidity drying out from the surrounding air.
...Rena's eyes were becoming even more frigid, piercing me with their gelid glare...

<Rena>
"...Why?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh? Wh-Wh-What do you mean...?"
I tried acting casual... but that facade... was torn off me the instant I looked into Rena's eyes.
That look... It informed me of Rena's response faster than she could open her mouth...

<Rena>
"...Why have you been... lying to me, I wonder? ...I wonder..."

<Keiichi>
"I...
 I'm not lying..."

<Rena>
"...That's a lie, isn't it?"

<Keiichi>
"...It's not a lie..."

<Rena>
"LIES!!!!"

Rena's outburst sent a jolt surging through my body...!!
Rena and I were still separated by what few inches that slightly ajar, but still-chained door could afford.
But despite that, I was still being cornered.
My house, which I'd considered a safe haven until now, had become more like a dark alleyway where no one could save me.

<Rena>
"...Shall I guess your dinner, Keiichi-kun? Let's see..."
I knew now that Rena had already known that my parents would not be here tonight.
...But it was still so strange that it had come to this...!
Even if she somehow knew that my parents weren't home...
 There was no way she should be able to guess what I'd be eating tonight...!!
But Rena said she'd guess...
 How could she guess it!?
 How could she know it was instant—

<Rena>
"Cup noodles...
 That's right, isn't it?"
—that I was going to eat...!?
Wait... the cooking repertoire of a man who can't do housework is probably nothing but cup noodles, after all.
...Looking at this statistically, it was the most probable answer.
...That didn't mean... she was guessing...!!!

<Rena>
"...I don't think you'll be full with just noodles.
 I think having rice and stuff will definitely hit the spot."
Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...
This was just coincidence.
...Rena was just reading certain tells of mine.
...So the fact that she was inferring what I was thinking alarmed me.
But it wasn't as if she was actually reading my mind.
If it was being read, then she was a demon.
...No, not a demon.
 Things like that...
 they couldn't possibly exist.

<Rena>
"...Do you like them?"

<Keiichi>
"Do you mean... noodles?"

<Rena>
"No...
 *******."
Rena indicated that the point my answer was addressing was wrong.
Her rebuttal was so short that I momentarily didn't understand the words Rena had spoken.

<Keiichi>
"...S-Sorry, Rena...
 What did you say just now?"

<Rena>
"Huh?
 About what?"

<Keiichi>
"Just now... You asked me if there was something that I liked, didn't you?"
It wasn't long before I regretted how carelessly I'd pushed forward with that question.
It was such a simple answer... That was why I wasn't able to comprehend it.

<Rena>
"...Pork-bone & Ginger flavor."
I wondered how I appeared in the moments my mind went completely blank until the moment I was able to recover.
As my field of view began to distort--slowly swirling in a counter-clockwise direction--I lost all sense of balance...

<Keiichi>
"Why do you know that!?"
I didn't even deny it.
 That was the type of frenzied state I was in.
...How could Rena... know even this!?
Not even caring as I mashed my head against the door, I fixated my gaze on Rena.
...But she didn't even flinch when she saw me do that.

<Keiichi>
"I certainly did buy them.
 I bought a bunch at once.
 I bought a whole case!
 How could you know that!?"

<Rena>
"...Why, I wonder?
 Quite strange, isn't it?
 ...Isn't it?"
How could you dodge the question at a time like this!?
The chain and the door suddenly were no longer protecting me.

<Keiichi>
"How do you know!?
 Why do you know!?
 Answer me!!!!"

<Rena>
"...You bought them at Seventh Mart...
 didn't you?"
A shiver ran up my spine...
I tried covering it up with an angry facade.

<Keiichi>
"Like I said... why do you know that!?!?"

<Rena>
"...I was behind you... following you the whole time."

<Keiichi>
"Wh... What are you saying...!?"
I couldn't understand why she was saying she'd been following me all this time.

<Rena>
"That's because...
 Rena was...
 right behind...
 Keiichi-kun's back...
 the whole time...
 Hehahahaha."
Like that night...?
That night I was absorbed in my phone conversation with Ooishi-san. I didn't even sense her being there... Standing behind the door... behind me... standing there... Just like that!?!?

<Rena>
"When Keiichi was picking out the noodles, I was watching the entire time.

<Rena>
You picked out so many different flavors, didn't you?
 Then your mom got angry...
 If you were going to pick the expensive ones, then you should just pick one type, she said.

<Rena>
Then Keiichi-kun picked out that big box of Pork-bone & Ginger flavor that he loves so much, didn't he☆?
 I like it too...
 Pork-bone noodles.
 But I can never eat a whole big bowl myself."
My brain was paralyzed, dulling my senses.
It might have been a defense mechanism... to diminish the fear I was feeling to non-traumatizing levels.
With the fear being diminished... The fog enveloping my mind was cleared away.
Then... I could understand what Rena was saying and started to put meaning behind her words...
Even so, my fear hadn't subsided completely.
...It was like... I was standing at the edge of a cliff, eyes closed so I didn't have to look down. It didn't actually solve any of the basic problems.
I slowly took a step backwards.
 And as I withdrew... Rena advanced.

<Rena>
"...So Keiichi-kun...
 Can you open this?
 We can eat dinner together☆
 I'm sure it's going to be delicious, so... okay...?"
Rena's pale, slender fingers squirmed through the crack in the door one at a time, as if they had a mind of their own, rattling the chain...
If she had unlatched the chain from the door, a feeling of terror would have just exploded within me.
...But Rena didn't do that.
She was simply imploring me to remove the chain.
I tried my hardest to light the fuse to the powder keg in my heart...
 Trying again and again.
 *clatter clatter*
 ...But it doesn't light...
 It doesn't light!

<Rena>
"...Open up?
 Keiichi-kun...?"

<Keiichi>
"P... Please go away...
 I beg you... please go away...!!"


<Rena>
"...How can you say something so mean, I wonder...?
 ...I wonder?"

<Keiichi>
"Please go away!!
 Go away!!!!
 GO AWAAAAAY!!!!"
The powder keg inside me finally went off.
No smoldering—it just exploded.
I tackled the door.
The force through the door had knocked Rena momentarily off-balance.
I couldn't hesitate here...!!
I grabbed onto the doorknob with both hands, planted my feet firmly, and pulled with all my might!!
But that slamming sound I so desired didn't happen.
I could feel a tiny, disturbing bit of resistance keeping the door from closing.
And the source of that was... Rena's fingers.
Each of those fingers wriggling... squirming around like the tendrils of a carnivorous plant through the crack in the doorway...!

<Rena>
"It hurts...
 It hurts, Keiichi-kun...
 It hurts...
 Uwh..."
It wasn't a harsh shriek, but more of a yelp she was trying to keep back.

<Keiichi>
"Go away... go away... go away...!!!"
I kept on pulling on the door with all my might...!!
I didn't even realize that if I didn't loosen my pull on the door at least momentarily, Rena wouldn't be able to pull her fingers out, and that was why the door wasn't closing.

<Rena>
"...It really hurts, Keiichi-kun...
 I'm sorry if I was messing around too much...
 Uuwh..."
I didn't care one bit for her apology.
No matter how much she apologized, it didn't change any of what she had done up until now...
 It didn't change anything!

<Rena>
"It huurts...
 It huurts...
 I'm sorry...
 I'm sorry...
 I'm sorry..."

<Keiichi>
"Go away, go away!!
 GO AWAAAAAAAAY!!"
Rena couldn't leave even if she wanted to because I'd trapped her fingers...
Rena's white fingers had become deep red and were no longer even squirming.

<Rena>
"I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry..."

<Keiichi>
"Go away, go away, go away...!!!"

<Rena>
"I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry."
Rena's apologies were occasionally twisted with pain... but like a broken record... she was intent on repeating it over and over...
Go away,
 go away,
 go away...
 STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!
I pulled on the door even harder!!!
Finally, Rena's fingers were somehow able to slip out from their imprisonment in the doorway.
The moment that happened, the door closed soundly, and I could hear the thud of Rena falling on her butt on the other side.
I locked the door immediately.
It made a loud clunk, voicing my rejection to Rena.

<Rena>
"I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 ...Keiichi-kun,
 I'm sorry...
 Open up... Keiichi-kun..."
Rena leaned against the door, apologizing profusely and nothing else.
After confirming that I was sufficiently sealed off from her, I trudged away from the entryway.
On the other side, I could still hear Rena echoing her apology: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." Those pitiful words, they would be forever seeking my forgiveness.
I didn't feel bad about this at all.
But that wasn't out of any sort of malice.
I just... I felt a sort of hazy sense of relief that I was able to escape from Rena.
Before, Mion had threatened me at this doorway... saying there was nothing she didn't know.
And just now, at the same place... Rena told me the same thing.
...My feeble attempts to disguise the fact my parents weren't home had served no purpose from the start.
...I should have just pretended to be out, and not even opened the door!
My meager plans hadn't helped at all.
In Hinamizawa... it was impossible... to outwit 'Them'...!
Even though I was on the other side of the door, I wanted to get as far away from Rena as possible.
One step, two steps... With each one, her sniveling apologies became more distant...
I sprinted up the stairs and dove into my room.
...As you would expect, I was finally no longer able to hear Rena repeating her endless apology.
Diving into my bed, I was startled by the hard lump I felt...
There was something... in my bed!?!?
...It was the receiver.
I finally remembered.
 I was in the middle of a call with Ooishi-san.
Looking at the clock, apparently not much time had passed since I went downstairs.
Could it be that my clock had run out of batteries...??
I had talked with Rena for so long... How did almost no time pass...!?
But the hand on the clock... was ticking forward one second every second as usual...
As I put the still-warm receiver to my ear... time—which felt frozen— began moving once again.

<Keiichi>
"...Hello... Ooishi-san?
 Sorry to keep you waiting."

<Ooishi>
"No, not at all. I didn't wait that long."
It became apparent that the amount of time that had passed between myself and Ooishi-san was different.
Over the phone, I could hear an energetic voice from a sports program or something. It drove home just how far away Ooishi-san really was...

<Keiichi>
"...Rena came just now."

<Ooishi>
"Did she come to play?"

<Keiichi>
"..."
I wasn't confident that I could coherently explain the situation to Ooishi-san.
But I didn't need to right now. Right now, I needed to know about Rena.
That's right. I was planning to ask Ooishi-san more about Rena, but Rena's little visit had interrupted the conversation...
What was true and what was false... I couldn't tell.
The one thing I knew was the single grim reality that Rena was suspicious.
I might be able to figure something out if I asked Ooishi-san about her.
...Up until now, I had regretted it whenever I forced myself to ask about things that I was better off not knowing.
But... looking at it that way, you could say I'd hit rock bottom.
There was no possible way I could feel any more regret than I did right now.
No... rather, I wanted to know if there was anything beyond this I would regret more.
Forget about tomorrow, it wasn't out of the realm of possibility for something to happen tonight.
I wanted to know everything I could.
...I was absolutely not going to die like this.
...Not without knowing anything. I definitely won't...!

<Ooishi>
"Regarding Rena Ryuugu-san?
 I did a bit of digging.
 Yeah, well... it wasn't much."
I understood that Ooishi-san was talking in circles.
 "A bit" meant, "I dug so deep it'd be hard to discuss with you since you're her friend."

<Keiichi>
"I want to know everything from your research."

<Ooishi>
"...I don't think you'll be very interested in what I have to say, though."

<Keiichi>
"Ooishi-san."
I spoke as calmly as possible to Ooishi-san, who was continuing to avoid the issue.
And then... I said it.

<Keiichi>
"I think Rena Ryuugu is suspicious.

<Keiichi>
Even if the past incidents were from Oyashiro-sama's curse...
 Rena Ryuugu is involved."

<Ooishi>
"Do you have some sort of proof that makes you believe Rena-san is suspicious?"
The manner in which Ooishi-san spoke became very firm.
...Do you have some sort of proof?
That was him talking as a detective.

<Keiichi>
"I only have circumstantial evidence."

<Ooishi>
"...I see."
I could tell even over the phone how disappointed Ooishi-san was.
Pulling on the fishing line when he felt a bite, only to reel in the bait.
 Disappointed, but ready to cast the line once more... that's how it seemed.

<Keiichi>
"Ooishi-san...
 You can't do anything... without physical proof, can you?"
What I meant was: you can't come and save me without proof?
 I stuck that barb in there.
As Ooishi-san loved roundabout ways of saying things, he understood me just fine.

<Ooishi>
"It's fine, Maebara-san.
 I'll protect you."
...That was not the least bit reassuring.
Ooishi-san was just using me to continue his investigation.
I was just going to get killed, and my corpse would be an important piece of evidence. That was all I was to him.

<Keiichi>
"Whether I'm alive or dead may be of no concern to your investigation, but it's all over for me when I die!"
Ooishi-san went silent on the other end of the line.
...That may have been too blunt, but I didn't care.
...All I needed to relay to Ooishi-san was that I was currently in a very dangerous position.

<Keiichi>
"So please, tell me.
 Tell me about Rena."

<Ooishi>
"..."

<Keiichi>
"Satoshi transferred out...
 Not too far in the future, I'll probably also do what Rena called 'transferring out' as well.
 But you won't be able to find my corpse...

<Keiichi>
You haven't even been able to find Satoshi's body yet!!"

<Ooishi>
"All right, Maebara-san, please calm down..."
I was already suppressing my agitation, even without Ooishi-san having to tell me...
It wouldn't solve anything if I continued to scream about my mistrust in the police.
It would seem that I could only depend on myself and the bat Satoshi left behind to protect myself.
Then I at least wanted to know about what happened before Rena transferred schools.

<Ooishi>
"...You're aware that this won't be very interesting, right?"
Ooishi-san, realizing my resolve couldn't be swayed, finally caved.

<Keiichi>
"Right now, to me, there is nothing that I'll find uninteresting.
 Please..."

<Ooishi>
"...There are a few things I need you to agree to."

<Keiichi>
"Okay."

<Ooishi>
"Please keep this confidential.

<Ooishi>
Also, part of this may be speculation.
 Not all of it may be true...
 Are you still interested?"

<Keiichi>
"It might not be true...?
 I don't understand what you mean."

<Ooishi>
"There isn't one main investigation for the mysterious chain of deaths in Hinamizawa.
 Each one is treated as its own individual case.

<Ooishi>
Thus, Rena Ryuugu has never been linked to any of the investigations.
 Basically, you see..."

<Keiichi>
"...This isn't an investigation of Rena done by the police...
 and is a personal inquiry, is what you're telling me?"

<Ooishi>
"...This'll make things a lot quicker since you understand...
 All of it is from either phone calls or meetings and interviews.
 So they aren't corroborated. 

<Ooishi>
I'm asking you to take this all with a grain of salt... is what I mean.
 Do we have an agreement?"

<Keiichi>
"...All of it is just from what you heard?"

<Ooishi>
"Yes, my apologies. It's all my personal investigation, you see."

<Keiichi>
"That thing...
 before, you said you saw Rena's chart, didn't you?
 I'm sure I heard you say that."
Ooishi-san paused for a moment on the other end of the line.

<Ooishi>
"...I told you that, too? Huahaha!
 Please pretend you didn't hear anything about that."
I didn't care about Ooishi-san having certain obligations and responsibilities.
I also didn't care if there was no proof.
Even if they were just rumors, there's no smoke without fire, after all.

<Keiichi>
"...Please tell me. Ooishi-san."

<Ooishi>
"Understood..."
Ooishi-san finally opened those tight lips of his.
It seemed that Rena lived in Hinamizawa a long time ago.
She had moved to Ibaraki Prefecture just before starting elementary school.
Then... following that...
 right after transferring...
The unfortunate incident with the breaking of the school windows happened.
Then Rena confided to the doctor.
"It was Oyashiro-sama."
This was everything I knew.

<Ooishi>
"...There isn't much difference between what I know and what you know, Maebara-san."

<Keiichi>
"Then what part did you investigate further...?"
I didn't need to ask.
...It was the incident right before she transferred back to Hinamizawa.

<Keiichi>
"The incident Rena was responsible for... and what she divulged to the doctor afterwards...
 correct?"

<Ooishi>
"...Yes."

<Keiichi>
"After you learned about that, you started suspecting Rena and the others, didn't you?"

<Ooishi>
"...Yes, I did suspect them."

<Keiichi>
"So they're the ones, after all...?"

<Ooishi>
"Ah, no... That's not what I meant by suspect them."
?
Ooishi-san was the type of person to say things with confidence, but these particular words were less than reassuring.

<Keiichi>
"Then... who did you suspect?"

<Ooishi>
"...That it was...
 Oyashiro-sama."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?"

<Ooishi>
"...That Oyashiro-sama's curse...
 really exists...
 Yeah, right, well... hahahaha...!"
Ooishi-san's laugh was quite dry, certainly not the kind that would make you want to join in.
Ooishi-san resumed the conversation.
About the dubious circumstances behind Satoshi's disappearance.
...The course of events leading him to delve into Rena's past.
Just then, there was thunder in the distance, and a heavy rain started pouring down.
It came without warning, a downpour fiercely beating the ground.
I had left the window in my room open a crack to let the heat out. The violent wind danced into my room, making the curtains flap wildly.

<Ooishi>
"What is it?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, nothing, it suddenly started raining heavily...
 Sorry, please continue..."
I got up while still on the phone and grasped the window.

<Ooishi>
"I said at the beginning it was an incident, but because neither the school nor the victims filed charges, the police were never involved.

<Ooishi>
...So, you see... those involved... were very reluctant to talk.
 Regardless of there being a victim who had one eye beaten so badly that it had permanent damage...

<Ooishi>
It could have been the school or possibly some individual who made arrangements to keep this from going public.
 Also, the psychologist was very strict about their professional ethics...
 Hello...?
 Maebara-san? 

<Ooishi>
Can you hear me?"
There was the figure of a person standing by the light near the mailbox this whole time.
Even in this torrential rain. They didn't have an umbrella.
 They were unquestionably drenched from head to toe...
 In this shower which more resembled a waterfall... droplets of water dripped down from her hair...
Just standing there... both arms dangling at her side...
In one hand... was the stack of boxes, wrapped in cloth.
Her eyes... focused on my room...
 Focused on me as I was about to close the window.
Her mouth... was methodically repeating... a chewing motion.
It was as if she had something hard to chew in her mouth... with her cheeks puffing out.
What could she... be eating... over there...?
How could it be that at this time... I was more enthralled by Rena... instead of the shocking developments being brought to light by Ooishi-san...
If it hadn't started raining, I wouldn't have gone to the window.
Then I wouldn't have noticed Rena, nor would I have noticed... "that"...
Rena's mouth was moving in the same pattern.
She wasn't eating something... she was repeating something.
What was it?
Was she repeating...?
To me...?
What was she saying...?
And why was I... right up against the window... fixated on her...?

<Ooishi>
"Hello?
 Maebara-san?
 Can you hear me?
 Hellooo..."

<Keiichi>
"I'm sorry."

<Ooishi>
"Huh? Maebara-san?"

<Keiichi>
"I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry..."

<Ooishi>
"Hello?
 Maebara-san!?
 What's the matter...!?"
Even in this torrential downpour... Rena was still apologizing...
The other self inside me drew the curtain hastily with my right hand, blocking my view of the outside.
But even doing that, Rena's relentless apologies still reached my ears.
I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry...
If I forgive you for this... will you forgive me for that!?
Please stop,
 please stop,
 please stop,
 please stop...!
I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry,
 I'm sorry...
Dammit...!!
 Why should I... have to forgive her!?
I'm the one who wants to be forgiven!
What part of me can't you forgive!?
I won't be killed!
If you won't forgive me, then I won't forgive you, either.
...I won't forgive,
 won't forgive,
 won't forgive,
 won't forgive,
 won't forgive,
 won't forgive,
 won't forgive,
 I won't forgive...!!

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san?
 If you can hear me, then please respond.
 ...Hellooo!!"



[Onikakushi Ch.14]

I guess I'd be lying if I said I didn't get any sleep.
I tried to stay awake all night, but there were definitely gaps in my memory.
I guess I kept nodding off and jerking awake in a panic all night...
I spent all night hugging the metal bat and sat on top of the futon I used to barricade my door.
 ...Waiting, waiting... watching just in case someone tried to break in through my window.
If I left this spot, someone would break through the door—sending the futon flying—and attack me.
But if I stopped watching the window, someone would break through the glass and attack me...
I tried telling myself I was just being paranoid, but...
 ...
 I couldn't sleep.
The thought of being so vulnerable scared the living daylights out of me!
If sleep meant taking that risk, I didn't need it!
It was so much better to just stay awake.
At some point during that endless cycle of nodding off and jolting awake, light began to shine outside...
 But that was it.
It wasn't so much the morning as it was just the sun simply having risen.
I snuck a peek out through the curtains.
Rena was gone.
...I couldn't see her anywhere no matter how hard I looked.
Finally, I could breathe a deep sigh of relief. The night was finally over.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tired, but I didn't feel like sleeping at the moment.
I still had time.
But I needed to make my own breakfast, so I'd better get started soon.
Skipping school was also an option.
With my mom gone, it'd be easy to play hooky.
Honestly... I debated it...
The risk involved in leaving my house was incalculable.
 So staying holed up in here was probably my safest option.
But... staying here wouldn't solve anything.
Ooishi-san wouldn't help me without cold, hard evidence.
Neither he...
 nor my parents.
So... unless I found some sort of proof, these relentless nights would never end.
I stretched my body, tilted my head back, and closed my eyes just like I did every morning.
I regulated my breathing...
 and regained my senses...
 Calm down, Keiichi Maebara...
Let's go to school.
Let's wait until they set their trap for me.
But that didn't mean I was just going to twiddle my thumbs.
 ...I needed to avoid that trap and secure irrefutable evidence.
Take note of the plates of any car that drives by.
If I see someone suspicious, check their clothes and face.
I wasn't just protecting myself... I was preparing myself to turn their attack against them and retaliate.
The tension was similar to when two samurai were both aiming to slay each other with a single motion as they drew their katanas.
I was not at a disadvantage.
I would have a chance to retaliate.
I finally felt a bit of courage growing in my chest.
...All right.
 Let's go to school.
I tightened my grip on Satoshi's bat.
 He was the only partner I could count on.
...Satoshi, please lend me your strength.
And entrust your dying regrets to me (since you were probably murdered).
I'll make sure... I dispel them.
With renewed resolve, I checked the clock.
It was still early.
Of course, I was going to school by myself today.
If I didn't want to run into Rena or Mion, I needed to leave now.
The shattered fragments of the cupboard were still strewn all over the entryway.
Right.
 I meant to clean that up last night, but never got around to it with the phone call and everything...
If my parents came back and saw this while I was at school, I would never hear the end of it...
Still, I'd be wasting time if I cleaned it up right now. And considering what would happen if I ran into Rena or Mion...
 It wouldn't be too late to clean it up after I got back home.
Making extra certain that the doors were locked, I left the house.
My uniform was still covered in mud from yesterday, so I left it in the washer.
Today I was going to go to school in a track suit.
By wearing a different outfit this morning, my mind was forced to accept that today was different from yesterday.
I had a hunch.
Today might be the day I get killed.
Keep your guard up, Keiichi Maebara!
The only one who gets to decide if today is my last... is me.
I spent the morning practicing my swing like it was my natural routine.
After a while, Rena arrived at school.
Our eyes met, but we said nothing.
Rena said nothing about last night.
...As if it never happened.
But I could see that those events were real by the wounds carved into her fingers.
I just heard her telling Satoko and the others that the bandages were from hurting herself in the kitchen.
...Though, it wasn't like it bothered me.
The details that Ooishi-san shared about Rena's incident before her transfer played vividly in my mind.
Now that I knew about it, I couldn't even dream of Rena as a cute, ideal girl.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan, I see you're still aiming for the nationals."
It was Mion.
I had already sensed her approach, so I wasn't that surprised.

<Keiichi>
"Oh, Mion.
 If you understand, then leave me alone.
 I'm busy practicing."
I gave her a curt reply without my usual jokes.
Then I gave the bat an even larger swing, tacitly keeping Mion from getting any closer.

<Mion>
"Hey Kei-chan, take it easy."
I think Mion got the message, but she still urged me to give it a rest.

<Keiichi>
"Homeroom's not that far off, is it?
 ...Just let me finish practicing."
I swung the bat even harder as a sign of my refusal.

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan, when did you get into baseball?"

<Keiichi>
"Just recently."

<Mion>
"Recently? You mean yesterday?"

<Keiichi>
"...Don't ask if you already know."

<Mion>
"...Oh dear.
 That's a very unsportsmanlike reply."

<Keiichi>
"You're distracting me.
 ...Go away."
I ignored Mion and kept swinging.
Normally she'd get mad or bored and leave if someone gave her the cold shoulder like this.
 But Mion just stood there, waiting patiently for me to stop swinging.
...I didn't sense any hostility.
But we were at school, in plain view.
I doubt she'd suddenly attack me here.
 ...Or was that too naive?
Still, I was starting to get tired.
...Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to take a break and hear her out.

<Keiichi>
"...You need me for something, right?
 What is it?"
Sweat poured from me as I stopped swinging.
I noticed my shoulders were heaving as I breathed.
 ...I cursed my lack of exercise.
At this rate, I might not be able to move as needed when the time came.
I should probably keep practicing my swings to build stamina in addition to the excuse for carrying the bat around with me.

<Mion>
"Well, it's nothing important...
 If you're tired, I can ask again later?"

<Keiichi>
"Now is fine."
I'm only dealing with you right now because I judged this situation to be safe.
Talking to you alone and away from others? ...That's out of the question.

<Mion>
"Well...
 Umm..."
Mion was uncharacteristically trying to choose her words.
But unlike Ooishi-san, it didn't look like she was going to talk about something I'd rather not hear.
Mion was puzzled, trying to find the right thing to say.
...But then she gave a hearty laugh to break herself out of that mire.

<Mion>
"Ah hah hah haha!
 This old man's just no good at this stuff.
 Having a poor vocabulary hurts."

<Keiichi>
"...What's this all of a sudden?
 If you have something to say, just say it."

<Mion>
"Stop it.
 Stop that swinging."
She cut straight to the point.
Her request was so frank, I didn't understand it for a moment.
I had already stopped swinging to listen to her, hadn't I?

<Keiichi>
"...I just stopped, didn't I?"

<Mion>
"That's not what I meant.
 I want today to be the last day you swing that bat.
 I'm sorry."
It took me some time to understand what she was asking for.
...What's wrong with swinging a bat?

<Keiichi>
"Why?
 It's none of your business, is it?
 I'm not bothering anyone, am I!?"

<Mion>
"You are."
Mion said it flat out.
This didn't make any sense and that was really irritating.

<Keiichi>
"When did I bother anybody!?"

<Mion>
"...Uhh!
 ...Umm..."
Mion was at a loss for words.
But she finally made up her mind and spoke.
Though she stuttered as she said it.

<Mion>
"B-Because Kei-chan...
 that...
 that's someone else's bat.
 You shouldn't borrow it without permission..."

<Keiichi>
"It was left behind by a student who transferred, right?
 I'm just borrowing it until he comes back for it."

<Mion>
"Huh? Ah!
 ...Yeah... He transferred..."
Mion grew uncharacteristically flustered.
That made it all too clear that his transfer was a lie.

<Keiichi>
"But strange, isn't it?
 For the older brother to transfer by himself?
 ...While his little sister stayed behind?"
Mion couldn't hide her reaction as my words shook her up.

<Mion>
"...K-Kei-chan... you knew!?"

<Keiichi>
"Satoshi Houjou.
 Satoko's older brother, right?
 The one demoned away last year."
Unable to respond to that, Mion fell silent.

<Keiichi>
"Rena asked the same thing.
 'Why did you start swinging that bat?'"

<Mion>
"..."

<Keiichi>
"She told me Satoshi did the same thing.
 Practicing his swings.
 Right before he went missing."

<Mion>
"..."

<Keiichi>
"So? Is this some kind of omen for Oyashiro-sama's curse?"

<Mion>
"Shhh!!"
Mion panicked and looked around.

<Mion>
"...Please, Kei-chan, don't mention Oyashiro-sama so recklessly!
 ...I don't believe in him, but the others very much do!
 Rena, especially!"

<Keiichi>
"Dangerously so...?"

<Mion>
"Anyway...
 You're scaring everyone!
 If you're just fooling around, then stop it.
 You have to stop acting like Satoshi!!"
I was the one who was scared.
Who do I have to thank for taking up this bat in the first place!?
...But it still unsettled me knowing that my actions were overlapping with Satoshi's.
It would be one thing if someone suggested it, but I thought I was making my own decisions...

<Keiichi>
"I'll say this now.
 I don't know anything about Satoshi.
 ...After all, you didn't tell me anything about him."

<Mion>
"...W-We didn't mean to hide it..."

<Keiichi>
"You were hiding the incidents that happen every year, weren't you?"

<Mion>
"Ah, that's because... we didn't want to...
 Ummm..."

<Keiichi>
"You didn't want to scare me?
 That's your reason for leaving me out!?"

<Mion>
"No, we didn't mean to..."

<Keiichi>
"Mion, I asked you directly if something happened at the dam, didn't I?
 ...And you told me nothing happened!!
 When someone was dismembered and murdered!!
 You lied to me!!!"

<Mion>
"I-I'm sorry...!!
 I didn't mean to lie to you..."

<Keiichi>
"Friends don't hide things from each other, right?
 Isn't that right!?
 Then you all aren't my friends!!"

<Mion>
"K-Kei-chan...
 we..."
Mion looked helpless and flustered.
Was I imagining the tears in her eyes?
...I never could've imagined Mion acting like this.

<Keiichi>
"Oh, by the way. Those get-well mochi you brought the other day? They were good. I thought I was going to bleed.
 Who did it?
 You?
 Or Rena!?"

<Mion>
"...
Me."
She admitted it so easily.
I couldn't help but be surprised at how easy that was.

<Keiichi>
"You could have killed me.
 How could you do that to a friend...!?"

<Mion>
"...B-But... it was just a little prank..."
Mion gave me a wry smile mixed with confusion, causing even more anger to well up inside me.

<Keiichi>
"You think that was a prank!?"
I grabbed Mion by the collar and lifted her up!
That wasn't the same as putting Tabasco sauce in a piece of mochi!
It was a needle! A sewing needle!
If I had swallowed that... and it lodged in my throat... what did she think would happen!?
Mion's face froze as her body rattled in fear.
...This wasn't the Mion Sonozaki I knew anymore.

<Keiichi>
"Anyways...
 You're not my friend.
 There's no reason for me to listen to someone who's not my friend.
 ...So just leave me alone for a while.
 ...Got it?"
 Mion wasn't replying anymore.

<Keiichi>
"It won't be that easy to erase me, you know.
 The cops have been on to you from the start.
 So don't think you can make me disappear like you did Satoshi!!"
I said it clearly.
This... was my declaration of war.

<Keiichi>
"I think you guys are suspects in the previous incidents, too.
 I also know you've spent a lot of time with the cops ever since the anti-dam movement.
 Don't think you can hide it from me... Got that!?"

<Mion>
"H-How...
 How did you... know...?"
Mion stood there with a dumbstruck look on her face.
That was when I heard the principal ringing the bell for school.
It was time for morning homeroom.

<Keiichi>
"...Let's go.
 The class representative needs to be there, right?
 ...?"
At that moment, for the first time, I realized Mion was sobbing as tears ran down her cheeks.

<Mion>
"...You...
 You're so mean... Kei-chan..."

<Keiichi>
"...Mi-..."
I wanted to console her, but I shut my mouth.
I had no need to feel guilty.

<Keiichi>
"...I'm going.
 Don't be late for homeroom."
I left Mion, still shaking, as I turned around to head for the entrance.
I had no idea how troubling it was to make a girl cry.
Behind my back, I could hear her muttering.
 It was a faint mutter as she was speaking to herself.

<Mion>
"...So that's how it is..."

<Keiichi>
"Huh?"
She wasn't saying it to anyone.
 It was Mion talking to herself.
But it was a sobbing voice that had a kind of giddy, cursing tone.
I inadvertently stopped and turned back towards her.

<Mion>
"...So it was... that bastard...
 He leaked it all to Kei-chan..."
She balled up her fists as her tears continued to rain down...
 She glared at a spot at the ground... with a terrifying... yet smiling face...
 Cursing...
A chill ran down my spine from that demonic expression...
This transformation... Mion's transformation, was different from Rena's.

<Mion>
"...I should've killed him back then...
 He forgot the mercy I showed him just because he was going to retire this year..."
Retiring this year...
 Was she talking about Ooishi-san...!?

<Mion>
"Damn it...
 Damn it...
 I'm going to kill...
 that damn old man... rrgh!!!"
It felt like the air itself had begun distorting.
With Mion at the center, the world had begun to twist and spiral...
 Bending.
 Whirling.
...This was the first time I'd known—no, experienced—such a visage...

<Mion>
"Rise!
 Attention!"
Mion made up an excuse for her red eyes by saying there was something wrong with her contacts.
After that, neither Rena nor Mion spoke to me for the rest of the day.
Neither Satoko nor Rika-chan looked me in the eye.
Strangely, I didn't feel hurt.
 ...Everything had just went back to the way it was.
The month since I transferred in had been almost too much fun.
 That was all.
School was supposed to be something like this to begin with.
I should have disliked that feeling... but today, it felt oddly refreshing.
The bell rung, sounding the end of the monotonous school day, which had felt so tense, yet so dull.
Since it would cause a lot of unpleasant memories if they asked me to join in to the club activities, I promptly started preparing to go home without even looking at them.
I stuffed the contents of my desk into my bag, wrapped my hand around Satoshi's now-familiar bat, and began heading towards the entrance.
I was assailed by both the exhausting relief that nothing had happened today and the tiring possibility of the same thing repeating tomorrow...
But... deep down inside me...
 Far beneath, in the recesses of my heart... achingly, I knew...
This would be the last day of this cycle.
I couldn't tell how the ending would be...
Whether it would end as I wished it to end... or if it would end as I hoped it wouldn't...
Regardless, in my current state, there was something more important than how things would end.
There was something I wanted to know.
Why did I have to be killed?
How did it come to this?
 Why?
 For what purpose?
The sunlight was relentless.
The sun, the heat, even the air.
 They wouldn't give me my answers.
...Or could it be... that the cries of the higurashi were desperately trying to tell me something...?
Somewhere, mixed in with their shrieks... Tomitake-san and Satoshi were also probably trying to tell me something...
I simply haven't been able to realize it yet...
...When I do realize it... I wonder if I will be amongst the higurashi fruitlessly crying to the next victim...?
Glancing down at my feet I saw a higurashi on its back, spasming weakly...
Bwee, bwee... bwee...
There was still much of the summer left, yet this one was already chirping its last song.
I couldn't tell what it was saying... no matter how hard I listened.
...But... I had to try.
...I had to try to listen to what it was desperately trying to tell me...
At that moment... The shrills of the higurashi ceased all at once.
As if... they had huddled together, fearing that the person who'd brought them to their dreadful fate had arrived...
There was no mistaking it...
 A presence was approaching.
The sound of footsteps was almost non-existent.
...If the higurashi hadn't warned me by ending their chirping... I wouldn't have noticed.
My exhaustion left me in a heartbeat. In its place was a rush of adrenaline that sharpened all of my senses.
I was just barely able to hold back that creeping, suffocating... feeling of horror.
...It wasn't something I could hold back for long...
But in this moment when I needed to be razor sharp... I was able to retain my composure.
I wasn't going to shout like I did yesterday.
...I hid myself calmly amongst the trees... waiting for my pursuer's shadow.
Could I get them to pass by me...?
No... since I was able to hear their footsteps, they were probably also able to hear mine.
...They might have already been able to tell that I'd hidden myself and was holding my breath...
The person tailing me... was it Rena, just like yesterday?
If it was Rena, I wouldn't hold back.
I could just yell at her and make her go ahead like yesterday.
If it wasn't Rena...?
...It would depend on how they acted, I guess...
The footsteps ambled closer.
I swallowed, wiped my clammy hands on my pants, and readjusted the grip on the bat.
I could tell that the fear that I had beaten back once was now waiting for another opening to come at me...
Who... could it be...?
I peeked out from behind the tree at the person following me.
...My imagination hadn't led me astray... It was Rena.
There was a bit of relief as I realized it was someone I knew, but that feeling left me in an instant.
This wasn't the same Rena that I knew...
Her eyes were dark and lifeless.
But her mouth appeared as if it was carved into a crescent... yes, it looked like she was grinning slightly.
...And in her right hand...
 was a hatchet.

I hid myself behind the tree once again and recalled the unbelievable sight I just saw.
What was that just now!?
The embodiment of terror, laid bare...!!
Baseball, practicing my swing, there were tons of excuses for me to be carrying a bat...
But for that hatchet!?
There was no excuse for that!!!
A hatchet... just like that!!??

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun.
 Are you playing hide and seek... I wonder?
 I wonder?"
My heart was pounding.
...Hard enough that I had trouble breathing.
What little composure I had been able to hold on to was now crushed. In its place, cold sweat gushed forth, covering my entire body, letting me know precisely what kind of emotion had taken hold...
Not good, not good, not good...
I wasn't able to hide myself completely.
She already knew I was here...!

<Rena>
"...Were you trying to scare me, I wonder?
 ...I wonder?"
I decided that it would be better to reveal myself now, since there was still space between us, than to allow Rena to come any closer.
I adjusted my grip on the bat again... readied myself mentally, and stepped out from behind the tree.

<Rena>
"Ahahahahahahahahahaha...
 I fooooound you, Keiichi-kun."
Rena was pleased that she found me, eliciting a mysterious giggle.
...Her mouth was smiling, but her eyes told me she was displeased by the fact that I had been hiding.
Those eyes...
 They were just so empty...
 My legs began to quiver...
Augh... Not good...
In the pit of my stomach... some sort of viscous hot and cold substance began spreading around...
If I allowed it... that substance would slip into my bloodstream and undoubtedly freeze all the organs in my body...!
Not good... not good...!
I'll be devoured by Rena at this rate...!
Strike back!
 Don't lose!!

<Keiichi>
"Wh... What is it!?"
I blustered, hiding behind my bravado.
...But Rena didn't flinch one bit.

<Rena>
"...Just the same as Keiichi-kun.
 ...I'm heading home."

<Keiichi>
"Then what about that hatchet!?"

<Rena>
"...Then what about that bat you're holding?"

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm practicing my swing...!!"

<Rena>
"Then I'm treasure hunting."
Rena gave a flippant explanation as to why she had such a fearsome weapon.

<Keiichi>
"T-Treasure hunting...!?"

<Rena>
"At the treasure mountain near the dam site... I found a new kyute thing.
 So I needed this to dig it out."

<Keiichi>
"H... How could I believe that!?"

<Rena>
"You wouldn't believe it, would you?
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
Rena's laugh was obviously very strange.
...I'd seen Rena's transformation many times before.
...But the one today was completely different.
Like her mischievous tone and the shrewd glint in her eyes...
 It wasn't something that roundabout.
...I'm not sure what to say... it was just so obvious!

<Rena>
"...Wait, Keiichi-kun.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
Rena didn't stop walking, even as she let out that eerie laugh.
Whenever Rena got too close to me, I would scurry away and turn back towards her. This cycle repeated over and over.
...No matter how you looked at it, I was being chased by Rena and was trying to escape.

<Keiichi>
"D-Don't follow me...!!!"

<Rena>
"I can't do that...
 My house is this way, after all.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
When I met with Rena on this road yesterday, she cowered and trembled as she followed my commands.
But today was different.
Rena didn't show a hint of trepidation.
...Actually... Wasn't I the one who was cowering!?
If the way home for Rena and me was the same, that's fine. I'd just change my route!
 That'd work out, wouldn't it!?
I turned onto a side street I'd never been down and knew little about.
But Rena saw me do that and followed me while laughing...!
Why!?
 Why!?
 Aren't you going home!?
 Then just go home down the street you normally do!!
Why... would you follow me down... this weird little side road!?
Those thoughts screamed in my head... eventually spilling out of my mouth.

<Keiichi>
"...Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you following me...!?"
The tone of my voice was already tinged with terror.

<Rena>
"...Because I want to talk to Keiichi-kun.
 Keiichi-kun wants to talk to Rena too, doesn't he? Doesn't he?"

<Keiichi>
"I-I don't want to talk about anything with you...!!"

<Rena>
"That's a lie, isn't it...?
 There's something you want to ask me about, isn't there?"

<Keiichi>
"Not at all!
 I have nothing to talk to you about!"

<Rena>
"That's a lie, isn't it?"

<Keiichi>
"It's not a lie...!"
"LIES!!!!!!"
Rena's scream echoed, startling some nearby birds into flight.
I cringed in fear. The only other thing I could do was increase my pace.

<Rena>
"Let's talk, Keiichi-kun...
 Talk...
 Talk...
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
Why was I running down this unfamiliar and deserted street!?

<Rena>
"Doesn't Keiichi-kun have something he's worried about?"

<Keiichi>
"N-Nothing at all!
 I'm not worried about anything!!"

<Rena>
"LIES!!!!
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
Even though I was running...
Even though Rena was walking...
Why wasn't I getting any farther away!?

<Rena>
"I know, I know.
 I really do know.
 You're scared, aren't you, Keiichi-kun?"

<Keiichi>
"I-I'm not scared!
 I'm not scared of anything—"

<Rena>
"LIES!!!!
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
My breathing grew heavy and it felt like my legs were giving out from beneath me.
Rena wasn't even breaking a sweat.

<Rena>
"I'll listen.
 This time I'll listen."
I had no idea what she was talking about or what exactly she wanted to do...!

<Rena>
"This time I'll listen.
 It will be different from the time with Satoshi-kun!"
When she said Satoshi's name, I turned back for a moment.
But even as I did that, Rena was still advancing.
I couldn't afford to stop...!

<Rena>
"Satoshi-kun was worried, too.
 It looked like he was having such a hard time.
 But I didn't listen.
 I was so sad."
Where did this street connect to!?
All these twists and turns, ups and downs!
It was hard to believe... that this was even remotely in the direction towards my house.
My sense of direction had long since gone out the window.

<Rena>
"I really regretted it when Satoshi-kun 'transferred' out.
 I thought that if I had listened... he may not have 'transferred' out.
 I really regretted that."
The road led me deeper into the forest.
...Wasn't I getting farther away from the village the more I ran...!?
I lost more and more of my composure the more I thought about it...
But despite this realization... my inner self was still disturbingly calm.

<Rena>
"So you see, I vowed...
 I vowed that if there was someone struggling like Satoshi-kun did, I'd save them!
I don't want to see anyone 'transfer' out again.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
Daaaamn it!!
What does "transfer" even mean!?
I won't let you transfer me!!
I won't end up the same as Satoshi!!!!

<Rena>
"Come on Keiichi-kun, talk to me.

<Rena>
I'll be able to understand you, Keiichi-kun.
 I'm your ally."
I started wheezing, out of breath.
My lungs were so hot that they felt like they were going to explode, and my heart was beating as hard as it possibly could.
...I should have practiced running instead of my swing...!!!
I couldn't even afford to scoff at that stupid thought.

<Rena>
"If Keiichi-kun doesn't have anything to worry about, he'll go back to normal.
 Everyone will be back to being friends and we can enjoy club activities again. 
Next time we'll team up and beat Mii-chan.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
Yeah, how much fun that would be...
Rena couldn't even imagine how much I had wished I could turn back the clock on these past few days...

<Rena>
"You could be nice to me again, too.

<Rena>
I want to go searching for treasure again.
 This time I'll prepare a nice lunch.
 Actually, we could just go right now.
 Let's go up to the dam site together.
 I'll show you the kyute thing I just found. 

<Rena>
I'm sure you'll like it too.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
My footsteps made pathetic flapping sounds as my legs wobbled and faltered.
Hot on my heels, Rena's steps were sharply breaking twigs underfoot.
I had to accept it.
...I was on the run... being chased by Rena.
If she caught me... it was all over.
...I realized it instinctively.
...I couldn't even begin to think of what the end would entail.
Just that if I was caught, it was all over.
 That's all I knew.
It didn't matter how it was going to end... I wouldn't let it end.
...Not without... knowing anything, not yet...!
That momentary lapse was all it took.
Of all the things that could have happened, my knees buckled underneath me and I crumbled towards the ground...!

I tried to stand frantically, urging my legs to respond!
I used my bat as a makeshift cane to prop myself up, but Rena was already standing right in front of me.
Compared to me, out of breath and utterly exhausted... Rena was so cool and composed that she could have froze the air around her. She wasn't breathing hard at all, rather, I couldn't even sense if her heart was beating.

<Rena>
"Are you afraid of something, I wonder...?
 It's not like you to tremble, Keiichi-kun.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
Her expression looked almost affectionate.
...Those soulless eyes... that mask of affection.
As she admonished me for trembling... Rena's hands deftly slipped over her head.
The blur of arms as they moved made me feel as if I was staring at the godliness of the thousand-armed Buddha.
...Then as both of her hands met above her head... the hatchet that she held came into focus.
I stared up at it in disbelief...
 It was all I could do.

<Keiichi>
"T... Tell me...
 what happened to Satoshi!"
Rena stayed like that, with that hatchet raised above her head, and solemnly opened her mouth...
It was as if she was expressing a farewell to a friend she was never to see again... that cruel scenario resided somewhere in her actions...

<Rena>
"I told you...
 Satoshi-kun...
 transferred...
 out."

<Keiichi>
"Enough of that 'transfer' crap!"

<Rena>
"..."

<Keiichi>
"It means demoned away, doesn't it?
 Doesn't it!?"

<Rena>
"..."

<Keiichi>
"You can tell me now, can't you...!?
 Who made Satoshi disappear!?
 Was it you!?
 Mion!?
 Or someone in the village!!??

<Keiichi>
Answer me!!!!"
I became frantic the more I screamed, but Rena did nothing but maintain the smile frozen on her face.

<Rena>
"...I have no idea what Keiichi-kun is talking about."

<Keiichi>
"Then I'll say it in a way so you do!
 Who is the perpetrator... of this chain of mysterious deaths!?"

<Rena>
"...You seem to be confused, Keiichi-kun."

<Keiichi>
"...Wha?"

<Rena>
"There is no human perpetrator.
 Everything is by Oyashiro-sama's will."

<Keiichi>
"Isn't Oyashiro-sama's curse just superstition...!?
 You believe in that too!?"

<Rena>
"It's not about believing or not...
 Oyashiro-sama
 'exists,'
 period."
Rena's gaze grew even more gelid.
...The ferocity of her stare was so intense, not allowing me to question anything...

<Keiichi>
"...There's just no way that something like Oyashiro-sama could exist...!"

<Rena>
"You don't believe...?
 In Oyashiro-sama?"

<Keiichi>
"...Th-There's no way I could believe it!
 There's no way it could exist!!"

<Rena>
"It 'exists.'
 Oyashiro-sama exists.
 Keiichi-kun should have felt it personally."

<Keiichi>
"I-I never... felt something like that!!!"

<Rena>
"...Keiichi-kun, haven't you felt someone apologizing to you before?
 Constantly, on top of that?"
All noise from the outside world disappeared. Only Rena's voice resounded, loudly and terribly.

<Rena>
"You see, until you forgive them... they'll always be with you.
 At school.
 At home.
 At your bedside..."
I couldn't understand what Rena was saying.

<Rena>
"It came to me, too.
 Oyashiro-sama did...
 That's why I 'transferred' and came back to Hinamizawa."
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
What does "transfer" even mean?
What was Rena saying...?

<Rena>
"Hasn't Oyashiro-sama... come to you as well, Keiichi-kun?
 I'm probably the only one who you can confide in...
 I won't let you 'transfer' out...
 ...okay?"
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
Rena's demented laughter clanged around inside my head.
...Was Rena saying Oyashiro-sama came to her as well...?
That's right.
...Last night I had heard about that when I asked about Rena...

<Ooishi>
"Please keep this confidential.

<Ooishi>
Also, part of this may be speculation.
 Not all of it may be true...
 Are you still interested?"
Ooishi-san began speaking...

<Ooishi>
"Neither the victims nor the school filed a complaint, so there's no preliminary report.

<Ooishi>
Basically... The police hadn't intervened in this matter.
 So all of these details are just what I heard from those involved...
 Meaning it's not that credible."

<Keiichi>
"You said there were victims?
 Didn't Rena just break all the windows?"

<Ooishi>
"No, Rena Ryuugu had attacked three boys.
 Using a metal bat.
 Two of them made it out with only bruises, but the other had been injured so badly that one of his eyes was permanently damaged."

<Keiichi>
"W-Wouldn't that be considered assault!?
 Shouldn't the police have arrested her!?"

<Ooishi>
"For whatever reason, the victim never pressed charges.
 There was no report to the police, so..."
They were beaten with a bat and suffered significant injuries!
Normally there would be a criminal investigation.
 But why... didn't they press charges!?

<Ooishi>
"I tried asking the three male victims for their side of the story, but they all were reluctant.

<Ooishi>
It's hard to say... but they were all afraid.
 Even after she had transferred schools."

<Keiichi>
"...Ooishi-san...
 Could you summarize it starting from the beginning...?"
Rena hit people while she broke the windows?
Or was it... she started breaking the windows after she got bored of hitting people??
They sounded similar, but the meanings were drastically different...

<Ooishi>
"On an undisclosed date.
 ...Rena Ryuugu was conversing with three male students, close friends of hers, near the pool storage shed."

<Keiichi>
"...Who were those three?"

<Ooishi>
"I can't reveal their names, but they were close to Rena Ryuugu and it seems they were a group of friends.
 She was the lone girl in their group."
...So it wasn't that strange that the four of them were together...

<Keiichi>
"So what happened?"

<Ooishi>
"I don't know the reason why.
 She took the baseball team's bat that was in the pool storage shed and beat the three of them down one after the other."

<Keiichi>
"Wha...!?"
There were no witnesses.
This was an account pieced together by the information given at the time of the incident.
One day after school...
Rena and three male students were at the pool storage shed talking together.
They weren't seeking help, rather, they usually met up there. It appears it became a heated discussion.
At that time, Rena underwent a "change."
The change was so abrupt that the three of them didn't comprehend what was happening.
Then, taking the metal bat, she attacked her friends one after the other.
Leaving her friends covered in blood with gashes on their heads, she made her way towards the school building.
Then she broke the glass windows one after the other.
A few minutes later, a teacher appeared on scene and subdued her.

<Keiichi>
"What was this 'change' Rena underwent?"

<Ooishi>
"What matches up in the statements from the three was... a sudden change.
 The point that there was a transformation."

<Keiichi>
"...Transformation..."
I also... could recall Rena's transformation.
I'd seen that change many times before. It was so different from the usual Rena that I couldn't help but believe it was someone else who looked like Rena.

<Keiichi>
"...That transformation they're talking about... had it happened before?"

<Ooishi>
"No, there was nothing like that.
 As far as I could find out, in her medical history and past, there was nothing like that."

<Keiichi>
"...Um, does that happen often? Where people change suddenly like Rena did...?"

<Ooishi>
"Of course it does.
 There are plenty of psychological phenomena that could cause something like that."

<Keiichi>
"Then... you're saying there was a dormant element in Rena that caused that transformation?"

<Ooishi>
"...I cannot say that for certain.
 But according to the statements of her friends, it's hard to believe she had such a side to her."
...Kind, caring, and adorable.
Even before she transferred here, she was probably pretty popular in school like she was now.
...That girl transforming suddenly and assaulting them with a bat... who could imagine such a thing?
...Nobody could have seen it coming.
I, myself sometimes believed that I was mistaken for thinking that was Rena... even now...

<Keiichi>
"Then... what happened after that...?"

<Ooishi>
"There was a hospital right across from the school, so the three of them were carried in and treated quickly."

<Keiichi>
"What about Rena...?
 What about the police...!?
 Why wasn't there a criminal investigation!?"

<Ooishi>
"You see...the police can't get involved unless they are called..."

<Keiichi>
"Even though one was badly injured with permanent damage!?
 Why didn't they file charges!?"

<Ooishi>
"...That's what caught my attention as well.
 Either some threat or pressure was placed on them.
 Or they had a reason they couldn't file charges even if they wanted to..."

<Keiichi>
"We're talking about you, after all. Of course you looked into it, didn't you?"

<Ooishi>
"Well... yeah...
 But I told you at the beginning, didn't I?
 That the victims were all very reluctant to talk.

<Ooishi>
They didn't want to touch on the matter... or rather, they didn't want to be involved..."
Reluctant to talk.
Didn't want to touch it.
Didn't want to be involved.
...It resembled the villagers here and Oyashiro-sama's curse.

<Keiichi>
"Did the teacher at that school tell you anything?"

<Ooishi>
"A school is hallowed ground.
 You could say they tend to keep scandals under wraps.
 I didn't have a search warrant so I had to tread lightly, you see..."

<Keiichi>
"Then... there was no comment from the school?"

<Ooishi>
"No.
 They denied the incident even happened."

<Keiichi>
"..."

<Ooishi>
"It's just...
 Three male students were carried in for blunt force trauma that day...
 That's all there was in the hospital records."

<Keiichi>
"...The victims didn't speak, the school denied it happened...
 Then you don't know anything at all!"

<Ooishi>
"Yeah.
 I know nothing other than the incident itself had taken place.

<Ooishi>
...The victims also wished this incident to be kept from the public... so if you and I both forget about it, Maebara-san, then this incident will probably just fade away..."
...For a brief period we sat in silence.
At first glance, it looked like a simple assault case.
...But that was just the tip of the iceberg...
The depths were obscured by roiling waves... sinking quietly into the void... as if it never existed to begin with...

<Ooishi>
"After that, she was suspended by the school.
 And during that time, she underwent psychiatric counseling."

<Keiichi>
"Did you hear anything from that doctor?"

<Ooishi>
"...Again, they were very professional in regards to their ethics...
 Or at least very tight-lipped!"

<Keiichi>
"Nothing even after you showed them your badge?"

<Ooishi>
"I was told to get a warrant.
 The badge itself has no legally binding authority after all..."

<Keiichi>
"Then how did you know... that Rena confessed that it was Oyashiro-sama who did it?"

<Ooishi>
"There was a nurse I asked in that department.
 She agreed to help me just from showing her my badge."

<Keiichi>
"...Then... what did she say?"
Turns out that the nurse hadn't heard everything.
...Apparently all that she remembered was what she overheard from inside the room.

<Ooishi>
"The nurse said that at the time, Rena Ryuugu was very calm and mild-mannered."
It was... more like she was confessing her sins at church than a counseling session.
She spoke with her mother there for some of it. But partway through, her mother was asked to leave, so it became a private counseling session between just the doctor and Rena for a while.

<Keiichi>
"The part with Oyashiro-sama, when did that pop up...?"

<Ooishi>
"Partway through.
 She screamed the name suddenly.
 That startled the nurse and that's why she started listening in."

<Rena>
"...It was Oyashiro-sama!!!!!"
Rena suddenly shouted that.
...I had no idea what was said before that, so I had no idea what the meaning behind it could have been.
The doctor, calmly and collectedly, asked Rena to have a seat.

<Doctor>
"What is this Oyashiro-sama you speak of?"
Gently, ever so gently.
 A fundamental part of counseling is to be a good, patient listener.

<Rena>
"Whoever abandons Hinamizawa... will be hunted down by Oyashiro-sama!!
 And... it's finally gotten to me!!!"

<Doctor>
"That's the town you lived in before you moved here. Isn't that right, Ryuugu-san?"

<Rena>
"I didn't want to move, but because of my mom and dad's circumstances, we had to.
 But... Oyashiro-sama wouldn't allow it!!"

<Doctor>
"Ryuugu-san must have lots of friends in Hinamizawa.
 Even now you must be missing them dearly, don't you think?"

<Rena>
"...I want to go back...
 Back to Hinamizawa...
 No, it's not that I want to go back, I have to go back!

<Rena>
I should have gone back much sooner!!
 But now it's too late...!!!

<Rena>
Oyashiro-sama has come!!!"

<Doctor>
"Oyashiro-sama is the name of the god in Hinamizawa, isn't that right?"

<Rena>
"Everyone knows... It's Hinamizawa's guardian deity...
 And if you ever try abandoning Hinamizawa by leaving... you'll incur its wrath."

<Doctor>
"You had moved... quite a while ago, didn't you?
 Then... It was just now that this god has arrived, is what you're saying?"

<Rena>
"...You might not believe me, but Oyashiro-sama exists!"
That nurse was then asked by another nurse to do something and left the room.
...That was all she remembered.

<Keiichi>
"That it was Oyashiro-sama's... doing, right?"

<Ooishi>
"I do believe there is that kind of superstition in Hinamizawa.

<Ooishi>
That if you leave the village, then you incur Oyashiro-sama's wrath.
 ...You should be familiar with this part, Maebara-san."
I knew very well what those scorned by the village incurred.
To hinder the dam construction project, they cursed the construction foreman to his death.
Then the following year Satoko's parents, supporters and leading advocates for the dam, were cursed to their death.
But... this was the first time I've heard of the curse incurred by leaving the village.

<Keiichi>
"This is my first time hearing that.
 I can understand outside threats being cursed by the village, but why also villagers who leave?
 Normally, people who leave villages aren't supposed to be cursed, right?"
I know it's a bit strange to say it, but I could see it as a rule that the people who come in are the ones who would be cursed.
Far from Jupiter, far from his thunder.
...Curses weren't something to chase after people that leave, were they?
Ooishi-san pondered for a bit over on the other end of the receiver, then began speaking again.

<Ooishi>
"Well... I told you of long ago when Hinamizawa was called Onigafuchi, didn't I?"
I recalled hearing that...
Long ago, Hinamizawa was feared and respected as the village of demons.

<Ooishi>
"The villagers at the foot of the mountains worshipped the demons.
 So Onigafuchi was hallowed ground that you could never enter.
 It came to be said that if you entered carelessly, you were cursed by Oyashiro-sama."
Those who set foot in Onigafuchi—in another words, Hinamizawa—would be cursed.
 I could understand that.

<Keiichi>
"I know that...
 But... for leaving to also be no good... that's..."

<Ooishi>
"Also, the demons, you see...
 They were being strictly watched by Oyashiro-sama so they would not enter into our world.

<Ooishi>
...In other words, Oyashiro-sama probably restricted interaction between Onigafuchi and the rest of the world."
...I see.
I finally understood what sort of thing Oyashiro-sama was.

<Keiichi>
"So basically... Oyashiro-sama is more like a warden than a protectorate deity, I guess?
 Trying to keep this place isolated from the rest of the world."

<Ooishi>
"I guess that's how it would seem...
 I'm sorry, I don't know very much myself.
 This is mostly what was passed on to me from my grandmother..."
I could understand it a bit better if it was like that.
Those who came to Hinamizawa would be cursed, and those who tried to leave would also be cursed.
So... because Rena originally lived in Hinamizawa and moved away, she fulfilled the requirements for being cursed.

<Keiichi>
"...So that means, because Rena moved away against its wishes, she was cursed by Oyashiro-sama. Is that what it adds up to?"

<Ooishi>
"In short... that seems to be what it points to, I guess.
 As a matter of fact, soon afterwards they did move back to Hinamizawa, after all."
...Those who abandoned Hinamizawa and left were cursed.
But then... why only Rena?
Shouldn't Rena's parents also have been guilty of the same transgression by moving away and have been cursed?
Also, in this day and age in Japan, shouldn't there be a lot of people coming and going?
...If every single one of them was cursed, then it'd be insane.
But in reality it wasn't that big of a deal at all.
...At most, there would be one person dying and one disappearing on the day of the Watanagashi.
 ...I don't like saying "at most," though...

<Ooishi>
"...Well, anyways.
 There's a lot I still don't know.

<Ooishi>
...Even if it was Oyashiro-sama's curse, it doesn't explain Rena beating her classmates with a metal bat, or why the victims wouldn't press charges.

<Ooishi>
...You don't think the victims were cowering because they believed that a terrible curse had befallen them, do you?"
Of course I didn't want to believe it.
But... more importantly, I had... just realized something else...
There was another bizarre connection that Rena made between Oyashiro-sama's curse and metal bats...
Satoshi fell victim to Oyashiro-sama's curse, and went missing.
I had recently learned that Satoshi had also become infatuated with the metal bat right before he disappeared, just like me.
Then Rena as well.
She was affected by Oyashiro-sama's curse, she confessed that much to the doctor.
...And the weapon which she had used at the time of that horrendous act was, again, a metal bat.
And finally... me.
I'd encountered various things that were inexplicable, and now I was holding onto a metal bat...
I was shocked when I learned that Satoshi did the same thing... it couldn't be...
 Had the same thing happened to Rena...!?
But there was one critical difference between her and Satoshi's case.
That being: Satoshi went missing after falling victim to the curse, but Rena was still here.
Both of them had fallen victim to Oyashiro-sama's curse, yet they were met with different endings.
...And finally... me.
I couldn't call it a coincidence anymore...
Rena,
 Satoshi,
 and finally... me.
Could it be... that I really was under... Oyashiro-sama's curse right now!?
...No, more importantly than that... what should I do now...?
Satoshi had been demoned away, vanishing without a trace.
Rena was fine.
 ...Fine?
Rena had undergone a change.
I could only believe that there was something that wasn't Rena residing within her.
And...
 Here, right now... It was standing before me!!!!

<Keiichi>
"Rena... please tell me...
 What... will happen to me...!?"
Rena stood imposingly, not answering.

<Keiichi>
"Satoshi disappeared...
 but Rena didn't disappear.
 So... what will happen to me!?"

<Rena>
"...Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
I had never heard such an unpleasant laugh before.
...It had become... akin to the sound of her breathing.
It was no longer a voice or an expression of feeling.

<Rena>
"...Don't worry.
 I'll save you."
Rena took one step forward... still holding the hatchet high above her head.

<Rena>
"...Now then..."
One step closer. Rena's face spread out to fill my vision.

<Rena>
"...Speak..."
One step closer.
Rena's nose was close enough to touch mine... and was still pushing closer.

<Rena>
"...There's something you want to say, isn't there? ...I'll listen.
 I'll save you... okay?
 Speak, okay?
 Speak, okay?"
I slumped down, landing squarely on my butt.
...It wasn't for some pathetic reason.
...It was all I could do to get as far away from Rena...

<Rena>
"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha..."
I had the gut feeling that I couldn't let her laughter end.
...Because when that laughing ended...!!
The moment I picked up on that feeling, my body moved by instinct.
I sprang to my feet so fast even I couldn't believe it, and pushed Rena away with both hands!

Rena was as light as a feather.
Thrown about by the unbalanced weight of the hatchet, she was sent backwards as if she had been carried off by the wind.
After confirming that out of the corner of my eye, I dashed off at full speed.
I was the perfect picture of "fleeing like a greased pig."
...Get away from Rena.
Run away.
Survive!!!
I couldn't think of anything other than this.
While I was running, I remembered I'd been holding onto a bat the entire time.
...Such a worthless weapon.
...I couldn't believe I'd forgotten about this weapon at such an important time...!
I sped even farther down the winding path!!
I didn't even feel myself gasping for breath or my legs getting heavy.
...My body understood it as well.
 If I didn't run away from here... I wouldn't live!!
I could hear the laughter of that simulacrum of Rena coming from behind me.
It rang through the trees and in my head, and slowly chiseled away at my sanity.
The grove of trees thinned out, my field of vision suddenly expanding.
Where was this...!?
For a moment, I was bewildered by the scenery I felt I knew but couldn't quite remember...
I quickly realized...
It was the dam site.
The fact that I'd dashed madly and ended up in a place like this gave me a bad feeling, like I was following someone's scripted plot.
I had a good view of my surroundings, but I didn't see a single soul here.
This was a terrible spot for someone on the run, but there was no better place for an attacker.
 My heart was already on the verge of bursting.
The muscles in my legs were screaming.
 But I didn't care.
If I stopped here, then they might not even be able to scream for much longer.
Even still, I glanced back, looking for an excuse to rest.
 Rena wasn't there...
Instead, I saw two villagers walking around.
I breathed a sigh of relief that it wasn't Rena, but a third party...
Except the voice inside me rang the alarm once again...
Villagers walking around weren't suspicious in and of themselves. But it bothered me.
They both wore rough-looking clothes.
 Empty-handed, they definitely gave the impression that they were just out for a walk...
But... At this time of day, two adults wandering around without a purpose. It was enough to raise questions.
...But more than anything else... those eyes...
They weren't chit-chatting while walking. They were both silent... heading forward... looking in my direction.
Was I at the end of my rope and had finally started imagining things...!?
...I should run away.
That was probably the best choice.
If they weren't involved, I'd lose them easily by running.
...If they were part of the group after me... then they would come running after me.
Either way, unless I hurried up, Rena would catch up with me.
That's right... I was going to run!!!
Deciding that, the moment I began to turn tail... both of them rushed towards me, as if they knew exactly what I was thinking!!
Somewhere inside me, I had jumped to the conclusion that Rena was the only thing I needed to be afraid of.
I made the assumption that I didn't need fear anything else...
But right now... I realized just how blatantly wrong I was!
Suddenly, the story Ooishi-san told me about the demons all leaving the village to hunt prey floated through the back of my mind.
I could tell they were both coming after me without even turning around because of their frenetic footsteps.
It was frightening, being unable to shake Rena off as she slowly closed in on me... but this didn't even compare.
Being pursued with such violent ferocity... this straightforward horror was unparalleled...!!!
One of the pursuers' arms grazed my shoulder.
...Now it wasn't just their frenzied footsteps, but also the distinct sound of their breathing that I could hear.
...No... I could practically feel them breathing on me! They were already right behind me...!
...Calm down, Keiichi Maebara.
Still running at full tilt, I felt the surrounding area go still... No, it felt like time itself had stopped.
I turned my head back slightly in that frozen world... realizing how close my pursuers had gotten to me.
...I couldn't win against the legs of an adult.
In less than the time it would take to blink twice, when this frozen time began moving again... they'd be right on top of me.
On top of me... and then...?
Don't think about that, Keiichi.
...First, realize that you won't be able to shake them off like this.
If the fact that you can't get away was a given, then you need to make a decision...
Go with the right leg or go with the left... you just need to decide which one.
Let's go with the left...
The moment I decided that... the temporal singularity burst into pieces!!
Right,
 left!!!

I swung the bat in a wide arc with my right arm, using that inertia, I stopped and suddenly spun.

<Man>
"...Wha—!?"
The two of them were clearly startled.
...Momentarily losing sight of me, both of their outstretched arms—ready to grab me—instead grasped at empty space!
The man on the right (I applaud him being able to figure it out) spun around to the spot I shouldn't have been, and faced me in astonishment.
 But it was too late!!!!
I didn't even need to swing my bat.
All I needed to do was extend my arms as I turned around.
It was by no means a heavy blow, but it seemed like it had enough power behind it to knock him off his feet.
But just knocking him down wasn't enough to scare him away.
He got back up in no time!
Both of them took a fighting stance and were ready to face me.
This made me certain they weren't just two people out for a walk—they were clearly after me!
It felt much easier than dealing with Rena.
Just by not recognizing their faces, by not knowing them—it made things easier.
 I smiled wryly on the inside.

<Keiichi>
"What do you want with me!?
 Next one is going to be right in your face, you bastard!"
It's fine if it was just a bluff!
By barking out at them, I was able to fire myself up.
They didn't respond.
They spread out to either side of me with unbelievably calm expressions on their faces.
One of them would grab onto my bat and the other would hold me down... was that their plan?
 Taking on both of them at once... would be impossible!!
Hot sweat poured from every pore in my body.
Then I'd just have to settle it with the first move!!
I'd step in and strike the first one down!!!
Narrowing my target down to the man on the right who had already been knocked down before, I stepped in and swung with all my might.
There was no way for an unarmed person to guard against it... it would cause immense damage!!
If they blocked it with their arm, their bone would snap like a twig; if they turned their back to it, then it was possible that the blow would travel all the way to their vital organs!
It looked like he was aware of this.
He pushed farther through the kill zone between us and delivered a fist right into my gut!!!
Not good... with this distance, in this position and in this state... there was no way for me to dodge it!!
The world flipped upside-down... I understood that I was being tossed around like a rag doll.
I landed on the soft earth without a sound, feeling the grainy soil press against my face.
...It didn't hurt at all.
...But the moment I thought that, I suddenly felt pain coming from the abrasions on my skin, as well as the contents of my stomach being forced upwards, flooding my mouth with a bitter sensation.
I knew very well that I didn't have the time to relish this experience.
I stood up as quickly as I could. But at that moment, the other man was already barreling towards me.
...Being able to comprehend calmly that I simply couldn't dodge it made it all the more upsetting.
After plowing into my stomach full-force once again, my assailant twisted around behind me and locked his thick arm around my neck!!
...My throat felt like it was being crushed by his immense strength!!
I couldn't even contemplate that I was being strangled, or that I was about to go unconscious.
...My vision simply darkened and a silent whining noise began playing deep inside my mind.
It took everything I had to keep myself from blacking out.
While this was happening, the other man was more than likely standing in front of me.
I wasn't able to open my eyes, but I could feel that he was there.
There was nothing I could do now.
Unable to shake this arm off me, I couldn't run. I couldn't fight back.
'Dire straits,' I couldn't even come up with the phrase that adequately described my situation...



[Onikakushi Ch.15]

A familiar ceiling.
...The smell of the bed and pillows... I knew them well.
...Was this... my room?
Normally there wouldn't be anyone in my room besides me, but their presence made me spring wide awake!
 ...When I did that... pain shot throughout my entire body.

<Rena>
"...Feeling all right?
 I think you'd better just lie down for a bit..."
Why was Rena in my room!?
 Blood began to surge through my muscles and my capillaries!
...But... Rena's smile belonged to the Rena I knew well.
...I knew I shouldn't let myself feel this way... but I relaxed thinking that this version of Rena was safe...

<Keiichi>
"...Why... am I...?"

<Rena>
"...Don't you remember?"

<Keiichi>
"...After losing consciousness... nothing at all..."
My body had become more lethargic than I could ever have imagined.
...I guess that would be the expected outcome after exerting everything I had back there...
I tried to at least clear my head... but I just couldn't shake the sluggish feeling out of my mind.

<Rena>
"I called the doctor...
 He should be here soon.
 I think you'd better just lie down until then."
I wasn't injured seriously enough to merit calling a doctor.
...But knowing that someone impartial was coming was slightly reassuring...

<Keiichi>
"...Why... am I here...?
 I'm sure... I was at the dam site..."

<Rena>
"That's what I want to know.
 ...What happened?
 When I got there, Keiichi-kun was already passed out..."

<Keiichi>
"...That's why I'm the one who wants to know...
 I was attacked by two weirdos..."
As I talked about it, I finally remembered what happened right before I passed out.
Recalling that memory and the terror that went along with it caused the fogginess around my head to clear right up.
Let's forget about those two for now.
...I didn't expect... Rena to be nursing me.
I thought Rena was trying to kill me.
She would have had the perfect chance while I was unconscious.
Not only did she not kill me, she had nursed me back to health.

<Keiichi>
"...Amazing you could drag me all the way back here.
 ...Wasn't I heavy?"
Looking at Rena's delicate frame, it was hard to believe that she had not only gotten me back home, but even dragged me all the way up to the second floor.
...Did she have some help...?

<Rena>
"...Don't you remember, Keiichi-kun?"
Rena appeared a bit surprised, but still kept her smile.

<Rena>
"...I only propped you up on my shoulder.
 You said you could walk on your own and that you were fine...
 You don't remember?"
...I didn't remember.
My memory was fuzzy after the point where I lost consciousness.

<Keiichi>
"...What about those two?"

<Rena>
"Huh?"

<Keiichi>
"...When you got there, Rena... the ones with me, or rather, those two guys..."

<Rena>
"There wasn't anyone."
She said it bluntly.
The way she stated it felt slightly unpleasant.
I was just too timid at that time...
I might have been able to force some answers out of Rena.
But if I did that... then this kind Rena might transform into the scary Rena who I didn't know...
Fearing that... I didn't press any further.
Thinking about it... it was the obvious choice.
...If both of those men were there, I don't think Rena would even have stood a chance.
I couldn't find a way to explain it unless I assumed she brought me here after those two were already gone.
Rena was still smiling.
Her eyes sparkled warmly.
...Yet...
 I felt like I was hallucinating when I saw something...
 something akin to a shadow slowly creeping across her face...
...That small omen... sent shivers down my spine...
While Rena was still Rena... I needed to make contact.
...I needed to contact Ooishi-san.
Rena stopped me when I tried to get out of bed.
She said it would aggravate my wounds, so I should sleep.

<Keiichi>
"...I'd like to go to the bathroom, though."

<Rena>
"...Ah... S-S... Sorry."
Rena couldn't say anything else.
While Rena stayed in the room, I quickly went downstairs to get the phone receiver in the living room.
When I approached the front door, the doorbell rang—ding-dong.
It must have been the doctor Rena had called.
It was strange for a patient to welcome in the doctor who was making a house call.
 But it would be incredibly reassuring to have him here for the considerable time it would take Ooishi-san to get here.
I carelessly opened the door with that simple assumption... and regretted it almost instantly.

<Keiichi>
"M... Mion...!?"

<Mion>
"Oh, you look just fine.
 I heard you collapsed, so I came to check up on you."

<Keiichi>
"...H-How did you know I collapsed?"

<Mion>
"I heard from Rena over the phone.
 Do I need any reason other than that?"
I understood why she would call a doctor.
But... why Mion, too!?!?
Rena was descending the stairs behind me.

<Mion>
"Rena, doesn't Kei-chan look pretty all right?
 Sheesh, you made me worry for nothing."

<Rena>
"That's true.
 Maybe I worried for nothing, as well."
They both began laughing.
...It appeared to be cheerful laughter... but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was a darkness looming over them...

<Mion>
"...Whoa, what's up with this shoe rack?
 How did it get like this?"
The shoe rack that I'd smashed to pieces had been like that since yesterday...

<Keiichi>
"Ah... um... I fell, you see.
 And the bat I was holding at the time slammed into it."

<Mion>
"This is what happens when you swing around something you're not used to handling."
...I kept the fact that it was none of her business to myself.

<Rena>
"But leaving it like this will really startle your parents when they get home.
 ...I'll fix it up for you later!"

<Mion>
"Now, come on, Kei-chan.
 The terminally ill need their rest.
 Come come, back in bed, back in bed!"
Both of them urged me up the stairs.
...I had no chance to call Ooishi-san.
I was pushed into my bed.
As it was the first time Mion had been in my room, she began searching around it intently.
She fiddled around my room and was scolded by Rena... You can imagine how it went.
It was uncomfortable having my room poked around, but the conversation was so benign that it was heartwarming.
During that innocent conversation, Mion said something as though it was perfectly ordinary.

<Mion>
"...Rena.
 Did you call the Director?"

<Rena>
"Yup.
 Right after I called Mii-chan.
 He said he'd be right over."
Director?
That out-of-place word gave me a bad feeling.
Rena called a doctor...
Then called Mion...
and after that... she called a "director"?
...Who was this director?
Since Rena and Mion's conversation was so peaceful, it only felt slightly odd.

<Keiichi>
"...What are you two talking about?
 Who's this 'director'?"

<Mion>
"Ahahaha, didn't you know, Kei-chan?
 We mean the Director when we say 'director.'"

<Rena>
"Like the director of a movie...
 Or, like a foreman of a construction site.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
I dug through all of my memories for a 'director' who might have business with me.
...Only one thing came to mind.
What Rena had just said...
 The construction site foreman.
The very first victim of the first incident, the dismemberment at the dam construction site... the foreman?
But that was strange.
He was supposed to be dead.
There was no way they could call him.

<Keiichi>
"... I don't understand what you guys are talking about.
 What does that director have to do with me?

<Keiichi>
...You said he was coming... did you mean to my house?"
I asked one obvious question after another.
But... all the two of them did was smile coolly at each other.
There was a huge difference between how the two of them appeared and how my suspicions were playing out.
...Slowly... I felt discomfort and panic welling up inside me...
...I couldn't understand what Rena and Mion were talking about.

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan, you've gotten into baseball lately, haven't you?
 Pretty sure the Director will be happy to hear that."

<Keiichi>
 "...So who is this Director?"

<Rena>
"Ahahaha. The Director is the director.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."

<Keiichi>
"...So who is this Director!?"

<Mion>
""Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...""
Rena and Mion looked at each other... and laughed haughtily.
That disturbing cackle unpleasantly resounded around me.

<Mion>
""Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.""
That laugh, long enough to be unsettling, ended abruptly.

<Mion>
"Oh, yeah.
 We should finish up before the director comes...
 You remember, don't you, Kei-chan?"
Her face was laughing... but Mion's eyes told a different story.

<Keiichi>
"...Remember... remember what?"

<Rena>
"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Keiichi-kun, had he forgotten, I wonder?
 About the penalty.
 About the penalty!

<Rena>
...Did you really forget?
 ...The homework with the mochi?
 The 'homework' where you were supposed to guess which one Rena made?
 ...You forgot about that homework, didn't you?"
I certainly did have that 'homework.'
But I had thrown away the rest of the mochi after I found that sewing needle.
So I wasn't able to answer which one Rena made...
The penalty... for that...?
Why now!?

<Mion>
""Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.""
No doubt my question was written all over my face.
Their answer to my question was that dry laughter.
I could no longer make heads or tails of anything.
I began to think that this entire day... was somehow insane.
Strange.
Incomprehensible.
Being chased by Rena...
 Attacked by strange men...
 The penalty Mion and Rena were talking about.

<Mion>
""Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.""
What... were these two laughing at...!?
It didn't take that long for me to realize I had been dragged into an abnormal situation.
...Who were... these two!?
Who were these people...?
 Who were these doppelgangers of Rena and Mion!?!?
Rena had gotten behind me at some point.
Why was she pinning my arms behind my back!?

<Keiichi>
"Wh-What are you doing!?"

<Rena>
"Don't move.
 This is your penalty.
 Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."
My body was already very sluggish... and Rena pinning my arms made it that much harder to move.
I seriously tried to struggle, but she wouldn't even budge.
My panic began to well up, and I realized this was well beyond the realm of jokes and pleasantries.
This freakishly monstrous strength... it would have been impossible for the Rena that I knew...!
Then... these thin, frail arms grasping me firmly... whose arms were they!?!?

<Mion>
"...Kei-chan, no struggling~
 Club rule number... ah, it doesn't matter which one.
 You can't fight against the penalty~!"
Mion... no, that thing that looked like Mion... spoke to me like how Mion would speak to me.
But... I was certain... that this was not Mion.
...Someone who wasn't Mion... someone who was just pretending to be Mion!!!

<Mion>
"Heheheh...
 Need to finish this up before the director comes."
Mion fished into her pockets and pulled out something bizarre.
...I could tell what it was just by looking, but for such a thing to be in her pocket... my mind wouldn't accept it.

<Keiichi>
"...What is...
 that...
 ...?"
It was
...
 a small...
 syringe...
It was a small, clear syringe, the kind a doctor might use if you went to them with a high fever...
Rena held me even tighter.
And I could hear that clattering laughter that no longer sounded like laughter blaring into my ear.
That eerie laughter... It wasn't something that the Rena I knew could ever produce from her own throat.
...This thing that was pretending to be Rena... was this their real laugh...!?
Unable to defend myself... the syringe Mion was holding... drew closer!!
And that needle tip was waved in front of my face countless times.

<Mion>
"Don't worry, don't worry.
 It won't hurt, it won't hurt...
 heheheheh...!!"

<Keiichi>
"Wh... What are you planning on doing...?
 What kind of sick joke is this!?!?"

<Mion>
"...What are you saying, Kei-chan?
 ...You know exactly what's going on, don't you?"

<Keiichi>
"About what!?
 I don't understand any of this at all...!!"

<Mion>
"...I know you know.
 No use playing the fool this late in the game."

<Keiichi>
"Stop talking nonsense to try and confuse me!!!"

<Mion>
"...You're going to have done to you what happened to Tomitake-san."

<Keiichi>
"...Wh... Wha!?"
The same as... Tomitake-san...!?
I didn't really understand what she meant.
What did that have to do... with this syringe...!?

<Rena>
"...You're playing dumb, Keiichi-kun.
 You should have realized it by now."
Rena whispered into my ear, laughing as if to admonish me.
...But even the way she spoke was repulsive beyond compare.
Playing dumb?
Me?
 About what!?
What do you mean... the same as Tomitake-san!?

<Ooishi>
"Everyone thought at first that it was a hit and run.

<Ooishi>
Except when the officer got closer to check if he was still alive, he soon noticed it wasn't a normal situation.
 ...His throat was scratched out."

<Keiichi>
"F-From a knife or something...!?"

<Ooishi>
"No.
 Nails."
Nails!?
Nails as in fingernails!?
With those... Gouged through!?
That's right.
...Tomitake-san... had clawed out his own throat with his own nails and died.
There's no way someone could die like that!!
So then, for that to happen...!!!

<Ooishi>
"We thought drugs were to blame, but nothing of that nature was detected."
That's right.
The police didn't find any drugs in Tomitake-san's system.

<Keiichi>
"Th-The police told me... they didn't find any drugs... in Tomitake-san's body!"
Gweh gweh gweh gweh gweh gweh gweh...!!!!!
The two of them laughed together with that sickening laughter.
Of course they'd laugh.
...To assume that such a medicine didn't exist just because the police didn't know about it... was completely foolish...!
Meaning... The drug that caused Tomitake-san to die in such a bizarre manner... did exist!?
If Mion injected this into me, then that would probably be all the proof I needed...
That would basically mean I'd end up the same as Tomitake-san.
...Become hysterical, scratching out my throat in my last moments... then die!
For such an outrageous drug to exist...
For Mion to be holding it...
And that I was about to be injected with it...
...At that moment, I did not feel there was any need whatsoever to question it.
What kind of idiot, when he's trying to dodge a ball flying straight for his face, has time to think of a reason as to why it's flying at him?

<Mion>
"...Just give up.
 Alright then."
Mion's actions lacked any gravitas, and that made it even more terrifying.
There was none of the ceremony like when someone is sentenced to death.
...There was no hesitation at all, as if she were brushing her teeth.
Mion reached out with one hand and grabbed onto my chest...!!!!
It felt like electricity had run through the back of my head and the entire world had gone dark.
Did I stand up too fast?
Or... did someone hit me really hard in the back of the head?
Having lost my sense of balance, I was assaulted by a wave of dizziness.
...I squatted down for a bit... When I came back to my senses, my entire room had changed drastically.
The numbness in my head was gone, and slowly... I could tell blood was flowing to my extremities again.
How long... had I been squatting here...?
How many minutes?
Or has it been hours...?
...It was almost as if the hands on the clock had stopped moving the entire time my eyes were closed... that's how little time passed.
...Really?
The air in the room wasn't filled with that madness from before... only a dull silence.
Rena wasn't there pinning my arms and Mion wasn't there about to inject me with a needle.
...No way...
 Could it be...?
 All of it...
 was a hallucination!?
There was no other presence in the room besides my own.
It was the weirdest experience I'd ever had.
...I was certainly... with Rena and Mion...
I doubted my sanity for a moment, but I was also seized with some sort of comfort.
Hahaha... I guess... that terrible ordeal... was a hallucination.
Neither Rena nor Mion... they wouldn't ever do... something so terrible...
My head... grew hot.
I could tell my emotions were welling up...
Why...?
That wasn't a reason to cry.
Why...?
...It was... sorrow...
...Why was I sad...?
I don't understand.
 ...I don't understand...
Kind to everyone... not discriminating against age or gender.
...Mion.
...That Mion was sprawled by the window in an unnatural pose.
Blood stained her a deep red from her head down to her chest.
The bright crimson smeared on the walls... that splatter had undoubtedly come from Mion.
She always had that bright smile and was kind to me from the day I transferred.
...Rena.
...That same Rena was slumped at my feet and was making the same pool of blood as Mion.
...

I couldn't comprehend what had happened.
...Did someone come to save me?
Then they beat these two down!? ...With... this metal bat...?
I finally noticed the weight in my right hand.
How long had it been there?
...It was Satoshi's metal bat.
It was covered in a deep red... There was no doubt that this was the weapon used to mutilate both of them.
And I was holding that weapon.
I was the only person in the house.

<Keiichi>
"Wha...
 ...
 I..."

Looking at this objectively, I couldn't think of anyone other than myself who could have done it.

<Keiichi>
"I... did this...?"
...That's right.
 Keiichi Maebara.
Of course I did it.
I... told myself gently... as if coaxing myself.
Hey, me.
...There is no reason for you to remember it, nor is there a need to regret it.
...Eat or be eaten.
You get that, don't you...?

<Keiichi>
"But... the blood...
 The blood...
 There's so much...!"
Neither Rena nor Mion had moved an inch.
It wasn't just a split forehead and a trickle of blood, nothing that simple.
...The entire room was splattered with red and that told me it didn't end with just two or three strikes.

<Keiichi>
"...Are they dead...?
 Both of them...?"
The depths of my mind were calm, but on the surface, I was panicking and agitated.
Calm down, Keiichi Maebara.
What happened to your usual calm self!?
Come on, now...
 Do like you always do... throw your head back and take a deep breath.
 Come on...
...Once.
 Twice...
 Breathe deeply...
...
Calm down.
Calm down...
I chanted that over and over in my head, and relaxed...
Color came back to my vision and smells reinfused the air.
At the same time... I remembered what happened when I blacked out...
Rena and Mion had attacked me.
They were about to inject me with whatever caused the same symptoms as Tomitake-san.
But right before that happened... I fought back.
I twisted my whole body and threw Rena as she was pinning my arms.
Then I followed through with my spin and rammed my foot as hard as I could into Mion's torso.
 It was soft...
Rena tried jumping on me, so I tackled her as hard as I could and slammed her against the wall.
I didn't let that brief moment of having them off-balance slip by.
Satoshi's bat that was left carelessly by the side of my desk...!!!
...Bweep...
At that moment, everything went pitch black.
There was nothing recorded past this point in the video tape of my mind...
No... that wasn't right.
...It wasn't that there was nothing recorded.
It was recorded just fine.
Just... the Other Me inside myself... had told me not to look and had turned off the TV.
Just because the screen had gone black and I couldn't see it... didn't mean that the video tape within me hadn't recorded it.
The TV was just off... the video was still playing.
The tape within me... creaking along... still playing.
On the other end of that pitch-black screen... that horrifying video was still playing on...
Compared to this, though...
...This, the scene right before my eyes... was still so difficult to take in.
There was blood splattered everywhere on the walls, the two of them in these unnatural poses.
...Not a sign of movement from them.
...I couldn't even tell if they were breathing...
No matter what the circumstances were...
 My friends,
 these girls,
 I had...
 I had attacked them...
...I may have even killed them.
But... if I hadn't done this, I would have been the one done for.
Balancing that out on an imaginary scale... it felt odd that I'd even feel bad about it...
Even if it was a bit excessive... this was justifiable self-defense.
The proof was all here.
The two of them collapsed here and Mion's syringe.
Mion's syringe filled with some unknown drug would certainly solve the mystery surrounding the incident with Tomitake-san.
And from the fact that both of these two were involved, they'd be able to pick out the criminals one after the other.
Still, I might be suspected for this.
 But that was just fine...
Anyway, now this should be a police affair.
This wouldn't fade into the darkness like Rena's past incidents.
As long as the police were involved... that should bring this to a close.
They'll probably revisit their investigation on the chain of incidents.
...Ooishi-san would... definitely get to the bottom of it.
Meaning... my wish...
...of not wanting to die...
of wanting to know the truth... That would be fulfilled in its most basic form.
It was all a matter of time now.
The doctor Rena called should be getting here soon.
I'll confess everything to him.
I needed to contact Ooishi-san...
At that moment, I remembered.
Besides the doctor, a "director" had been called.
It was easy to imagine that they were someone deeply involved with the incidents judging from Rena and Mion's conversation.
...The ache in my chest, caused by the gruesome deed I'd done, dissipated rapidly.
It was... not over yet.
This place... was no longer safe.
Stay calm, Keiichi Maebara.
...It's not over yet.
I needed to live long enough... to tell the police of this incident...!!
...At that moment, I felt like I heard someone's voice from outside.
Since people were speaking, it must mean there was more than one person.
I moved the curtain ever so slightly and peered outside.
...It was a bizarre sight.
About four or five grown men were all gathered at the gate.
They very much resembled the two men who had assaulted me at the dam site today.
...Those two might even be among them.
There was one person there wearing a white coat.
...But he didn't look like a doctor at all.
 My gut told me he was in disguise, only posing as a doctor.
That guy would probably ring the bell and get me to open the front door.
Pretend to be a doctor to get me to open the door... and then the rest of them would all rush in at once...
At that moment, I saw the car parked behind the men and my heart nearly skipped a beat.
...The... white van!!!!!

No mistaking it.
That van... the one that had tried to run me down...!?!?
The man in the white coat entered the gate and headed towards the front door.
The rest of the men hid in the bushes and watched him.
I probably couldn't pretend that I wasn't home.
...Undoubtedly, they'd just break the window and enter...!
...I needed to get out of here somehow.
Then... use a public phone to contact Ooishi-san.
Then meet up somewhere.
First of all, I need a weapon!
 Then shoes!!
But before all of that... there was one thing that I had to do...!!
...I had no intention of dying.
I'd live... and reveal the truth about this nonsensical 'Curse of Oyashiro-sama'...!!!
But... what would happen from here on, regardless of how determined I was... may bring about my demise.
...And that was why.
...There was one thing more important than getting out of here right now.
I need to get that clock out quickly and take down the note hidden behind it.
...Damn it...!
 The tape was sticking to it fast...!!
It'd be fine if it was torn a little.
I opened up the slightly torn note and began writing another passage with a ballpoint pen.
If I wasn't able to inform Ooishi-san...
 Then the only thing I could rely on was this note.
...I'd never thought a piece of torn, college-ruled, notebook paper could be this reliable before.
I had no time. I'd only write what I knew right now.
 I needed to leave some sort of information that would lead them to uncover the truth!!
"Rena and Mion are conspirators of the perpetrators."
This was an undeniable fact.
 ...I still didn't want to believe it.
 But it was a fact!
Anyway... I'd leave all the information that would help lead them to finding the perpetrators.
"There are four or five adults, maybe more.
 They have a white van."
...This was everything I was able to see from the window...
 There may be more.
Also... there was that unidentified person known as the director.
...To begin with... The term "director" didn't even mesh with Hinamizawa at all.
...If... they were going to include the directors from the past incidents... then the only one is the construction foreman, the victim from the first murder.
The very first victim in the chain of incidents.
Killed in a lynching, his body divided into six pieces.
His right arm was never discovered.
...The police should have confirmed that death...?
But Rena and Mion did both call him "director."
They said "director."
They wouldn't use that term to refer to someone who was dead.
...The police would never even conceive that someone who was deceased could be involved.
...Could that be... some sort of oversight??
I didn't know.
But... even if I didn't know... it could be a big hint for Ooishi-san.
...That's right...
...They needed to start fresh from the first incident.
It wasn't just a simple dismemberment, but the start of this string of mysterious deaths that would follow...
 ...
So, then...
 there must be something hidden there!
"Please reinvestigate the victim from the dismemberment incident.
 He's alive."
His death should have been established after an autopsy.
 Logically you would think as much...
But was that really the case?
Could it have been some sort of ploy that they were able to deceive the police with...?
I shouldn't jump to conclusions.
 But... he may still be alive...
I had no time to ponder that right now.
...Oh, yeah.
There's something even more important I needed to write...!
"Tomitake-san's death was from an unknown drug."
That's right.
 That drug... it was an irreplaceable piece of evidence!
No doubt... just by having this, everything would be uncovered!!!
I couldn't just leave that vital clue lying on the floor.
"This syringe is proof."
Writing that down, I stuck the syringe onto the back of the clock with plenty of tape.
So it absolutely would not slip out and fall to the floor... firmly...
 Firmly!!
Ding dong...
The bell rang.
...They were here!!!
I couldn't write any more.
...But even still...!
 There was one last thing that I had to write.
"I have no idea why it has become like this."
...
This may be the closest thing to the truth out of everything I wrote on this note.
"If you are reading this, then I am probably already dead.
...Though you may or may not find my body."
...If I was going to write out everything that could happen...
Either dying from the curse...
Or being demoned away...
"You, who are reading this.
 Please uncover the truth.
 That is my only desire."
With this... my last will and testament was complete.
It wasn't certain that I was going to die.
...But... it was my final plea...
 Just in case...
I folded the note, stuck it back onto the back of the clock, and returned the clock back to its usual spot.
I couldn't help but pray.
...Ooishi-san...
...If something happens to me... I leave the rest to you...!!
After that, I gazed down silently at Rena and Mion.
...This was probably the last time we'd ever see each other.
 Rena.
 Mion.

<Keiichi>
"I...
 really had thought...
 all of us were friends..."
But... why did it end up like this...?
I never had any fun in my previous school.
I only worried about standardized test scores; about if the school I hoped to get into was where I really wanted to go or a safety net... that was all I talked about.
...It was a dull life.
The people I called friends were also my rivals in studying, in competitions, in personal records, and standardized test scores.
Everyone here taught me how unhealthy that lifestyle was.
This month was really fun...
Making a fuss over lunch, making a fuss over the club, making a fuss over the festival...
Something hot began dripping from my face.
...Uncontrollable... tears.
I should have had no obligation to shed tears for them.
...But they wouldn't stop...!!
Even if they were after my life.
Even if they were trying to kill me.
Everything that happened this month... I wouldn't forget it...
Or could it be... those happy days... were all a facade as well...?
Was it all a trap... meticulously orchestrated up until today... to ensnare me?
Could it have been that I had just arbitrarily assumed that they were my friends...?
That... couldn't have been the case!!!!
Both Rena and Mion... They really were my friends!
Those happy days... There was nothing fake or unclear about them...!
Someone probably... forced them to try to kill me.
Or... their minds were taken over, possessed by the supernatural entity known as Oyashiro-sama!
Regardless... both Rena and Mion... they were the best friends ever!
And... when they were coming after me... it wasn't of their own volition!
But... they weren't the kind of people to sell off their friends, no matter what means were employed to force them.
And there was no way such a thing as being possessed by Oyashiro-sama could happen in reality.
Then... did the real... Rena and Mion... come after me...!?!?
What... was I thinking...?
What a silly, dumb idea.
...Having beaten down both Rena and Mion...
I was still debating if they were the real ones or fakes.
There was no real or fake...
Only the reality that was before me.
Rena and Mion were sprawled out at my feet... that was the only truth...!!
I was only trying...
 trying to twist the facts to my benefit, that I had beaten my friends to death...!
No matter how I spun it... it wouldn't change reality... Rena and Mion were both dead...!!!!
It felt like there was a crack in the dam of strange emotions I was holding back.
...It felt like my calm state, which was nothing more than a bluff, had receded, and in that opening... insanity was leaking out...
I killed them.
I killed them.
...Rena and Mion...
 I killed them...!!
The door bell rang again.
The unrelenting echo pulled me back into a state of composure once again.
I didn't have a moment to spare!
 Quickly... I needed to get away!!!
I didn't want to die.
 I would uncover everything after that.
The identity of whoever or whatever had pushed me this far...!!!
Even if I had to drink mud and eat grass...!!
I would survive.
 I would survive.
 I would definitely survive!!
I killed Rena for that very reason.
I also killed Mion.
I went that far just to keep living.
...So I can't die.
For my sake, and for the sake of the late Rena and Mion...
I have to survive!!!!
I ran towards the door and grabbed my shoes. The doorbell rang again, as if to urge me on.
...Behind this single, solitary door... they were there!!!
Keeping quiet... I headed towards the kitchen...
 Headed towards the back door.
Before opening the back door, I put my ear to it and checked for people outside...
No one...?
After I put on my shoes... I opened the door slowly so as to not make a sound...

<Man>
"There he is!! The back door!!"
A piercing voice echoed out.
...That voice stabbed through me... setting my hair on end!!!
I had to run!!!!!
Get out of here, Keiichi!!!!!!!
One after the other, I felt stuff like rationale and intelligence, those things you use when you have time to spare, spill out of me...
I didn't feel any pain from the branches scratching my arms and forehead.
My autonomously pulsing heart also felt neither fatigue nor pain.
My entire being just wished to live...
There was nothing else it desired.
It probably had no complaints whatsoever...
So of course I wouldn't feel fatigue...
I just... ran.
Just recklessly rushing in the direction I was already heading.
...Even if nobody was chasing after me, I'd still be running like this...
There wasn't a thought in my mind about where I was headed.
Turning around, I felt a presence right next to me.
That presence was, without a doubt, chasing me like my shadow.
If I took even one misstep
 ...
I would be devoured.
That's what I thought.
So I didn't turn around.
I didn't stop.
I ran...
 at full speed...!!!
Kwakwakwakwa...
That was the chirping of the higurashi telling me it was evening.
...Trying to tell me something... And then I finally heard it...
 The wailing cry of the victims who didn't make it.
Would I... be joining them?
Kwakwakwakwakwa...
Only the higurashi knew.
...They knew everything.
They definitely knew.
So... I ran towards where I could hear more of the higurashi's chirps.
But the farther I ran... the farther away their chirping became.
 I couldn't get near them...
Why are you all running away...!?!
Was it my fault?
Was I the one to blame!?
Then I'll apologize!!
I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry...
I felt that only the higurashi knew...



[Onikakushi Ch.16]

The smoking room was filled with a cloud of cigarette smoke.
The expensive smoke filter gave off some crackling electric noise, but it didn't seem like it was doing anything at all.
Why do smokers have to be shoved so far down this corridor where the sun didn't even reach?
...I recalled hearing that the tax revenue from tobacco was about a tenth of the municipality's revenue...
We were the most heavily-taxed members of this municipality, so I really wished they'd show us a little more respect...

<Kumagai>
"...Hrm, why would you discard the 5 manzu there?
 It's just decreasing your options."
One of the younger detectives was having a staring contest with the Mahjong magazine called "Next Turn."

<Kumagai>
"You're still in tenpai if you cut the 5 manzu."

<Kumagai>
"If you're betting on a Haitei, then shouldn't you be going into it with a Mangan?"

<Ooishi>
"Kuma-chan, look at the pond.
 They all discarded a 5 manzu. It's a safe tile.
 You'd hate if, at end game, someone was sitting on a tenpai on the last turn, wouldn't you?"
The kid let out another groan, put out his cigarette, then took out another one.

<Kumagai>
"...I just don't agree...
 Why would you reduce your own options?"

<Ooishi>
"By the way, you can't call ron with your winning tile in that haitei."

<Kumagai>
"What!? Why is that!?"
Just then, I heard a voice coming from down the hall.

<Detective>
"Are you here, Ooishi-san?
 You have a call from a civilian."

<Ooishi>
"Whoa, ain't that something? Welp, see ya soon!"

<Kumagai>
"W-Why can't you call ron on it!?
 H-Hold on for a second, Ooishi-san!"
The man sitting in the seat Ooishi-san was heading towards waved at the telephone receiver.

<Detective>
"Outside line.
 From a payphone."

<Ooishi>
"Oh, why thank you!
 ...Sorry to keep you waiting, this is Ooishi.
 Who is it?"

<Keiichi>
"Ah, Ooishi-san!?
 Hello!?"

<Ooishi>
"If it isn't Maebara-san.
 Why, good evening...!"
From the tone Maebara-kun's voice, I already knew he was in a predicament.
...This was the first time Maebara-kun had phoned me.
And he was calling from a payphone.

<Ooishi>
"Please calm down.
 Did something happen?"

<Keiichi>
"Uh,
 well
 ...Ahh...!!!"
His voice was erratic over the line, he had completely lost his sense of composure.
After checking that nobody else could hear, I prompted him in a hushed tone.

<Ooishi>
"What happened!?"

<Keiichi>
"UhhhUhhm... I... I... I..."

<Ooishi>
"...Calm down, Maebara-san!
 I can have the local officers head to your location.
 I'll be there soon, too!"

<Keiichi>
"...Ah, um...
 ...
 I think that's
 ...impossible."
His voice was quivering and hoarse...
...He wasn't surrounded by people even as he was making this call, was he!?


<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san, you're calling from a payphone right now, right?
 Where is that payphone!?"
There were no other sounds besides Maebara-kun's voice.
It had to be a phone booth.
I scratched out a note and thrust it at my colleague sitting across from me.
(Hinamizawa, phone booth!!)
He understood quickly and hastily started on the internal lines.

<Ooishi>
"...Calm down, Maebara-san!
 What is your current situation...!?"
It was best practice to avoid flustering someone panicking... but this was an urgent case.
...Maebara-kun didn't just get in trouble, get away, and then call me.
...He was in the midst of something dangerous right now...!
But... yelling at Maebara-kun right now would just needlessly cause him to be even more frantic.
Maebara-kun wasn't just calling to seek help.
...He was trying to tell us something more than that.
And whatever that was...
 If I didn't get it from this call, I was certain there would never be another chance...!
My colleague pushed a note in front of me.
(There's only one booth in Hinamizawa.
 A patrol car is on the way.
 Five minutes.)

<Ooishi>
"That's too long.
 How many officers are in there?"

<Detective>
"Two."
Not enough.
...If it was as I imagined... there were likely quite a few people surrounding Maebara-kun.
Five minutes was too long!

<Ooishi>
"Did you call the officer stationed in Hinamizawa!?"

<Detective>
"He's scheduled to be on patrol.
 They're currently out, and it'll be impossible to contact them."

<Ooishi>
"God damn!
 Kuma-chan, bring the car around."

<Kumagai>
"Understood!!!"

<Keiichi>
"...Hello?
 Ooishi-san...?
 *Cough cough*!!"

<Ooishi>
"Hello!
 It's all right.
 I can hear you loud and clear!"
There was something wrong with Maebara-kun...
That wasn't a normal coughing sound.
...Vomiting?
Or was it... blood!?
Had he already been attacked!? Was he injured!?

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san, the police are on their way.
 They'll be there in a couple of minutes, so hold on somehow!
 Hello!?
 Can you hear me!?
 Maebara-san!?"
I could hear on the other end of the line that he was having a coughing fit.
...The worst possible situation popped into my head.

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san!!
 Who is the culprit!?
 How many are there!?"

<Keiichi>
"...I...
 I thought...
 at first the culprit was human...
 *hack*!!"
I couldn't tell if that was a cough or vomiting.

<Ooishi>
"Are you all right!? Maebara-san!!"

<Keiichi>
"I thought that
 the culprit was a person
 and not Oyashiro-sama's curse...
 Up until right now.
 But...
 ...
 I guess... in the end...
 *hack hack*...!!"
It was an intense bout of coughing.
 Then vomiting.

<Keiichi>
"...But...
 I guess...
 Oyashiro-sama
 does exist...
 No, he's...
 here."

<Ooishi>
"Maebara-san, please, just please calm down..."

<Keiichi>
"I had been thinking it was strange for a while now...
 It's been following me this whole time...!!

<Keiichi>
I run and run and run and run...!!!
 But it just sticks to me like my shadow!!
 But slowly... so slowly...
 It's digging itself into my back..."

<Ooishi>
"...Maebara-san...
 Are they...
 right now...
 perhaps...
 right behind you...?"

<Keiichi>
"...Behind me.
 Right... behind me..."

<Ooishi>
"Please, Maebara-san...
 I can tell you're scared.
 But please!!
 ...Who is it... that's right behind you!?"

<Keiichi>
"I can't just... look behind me...
 If I do... I'll...
 I'll..."

<Ooishi>
"I understand that you're scared!!
 But please tell me!!
 You just need to turn around a bit!!
 Who is it...?
 Who is behind you, Maebara-san!?!?"
Right after I said that, I could hear him vomiting intensely.
 What followed was a nightmarish sound.

<Ooishi>
"...Maebara-san...
 It couldn't be that you're...
 clawing out... your own throat...?"
There was no answer.
But... I could hear something like scratching...
There was a bang, as if something was being hit!
...Maebara-kun had probably dropped the receiver.
I could hear groaning and vomiting over on the other end, and a repeating... abnormal noise.

<Ooishi>
"Hello?
 Hello!?
 Maebara-san!?
 Helloooo!?!?"
I knew how far away my voice would sound on the other end.
But... I couldn't help but shout.
At that moment, I heard whispering... coming from the other end.
I couldn't tell what he was saying.
...From the way he was saying it, was he... talking to himself?
Or was he... talking to someone there?

<Ooishi>
"Hello...?
 ...Maebara...san...?"
Rather than whispering... it was some kind of mantra he was chanting over and over.
I focused my senses... trying to pick up what he was saying...
What was he repeating...?
What... exactly...!?
Beep!
Suddenly, the line went dead.
 Did he use up his time...!?
It was because it was a payphone...!!

<Ooishi>
"...Ah."
It was because it cut out so abruptly...
The last thing he said came out so clearly in my mind.

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-san, the car is good to go!!!
 Ooishi-san...!?"

<Ooishi>
"...It was... I'm sorry."

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-san...??"
That's what he was repeating over and over.
...He said, "I'm sorry"...
I had a gut feeling...
There was no longer a need to hurry.
...I could hear the chirp of the higurashi... spilling in from the open window.
Kwee, kwee, kwee, kwee, kwee...
I should have been able to hear them this entire time...
 I just wasn't paying any attention.
Why did I focus on them all of a sudden?
Kwee, kwee, kwee, kwee, kwee...
Were they trying to tell me something?
Only the higurashi knew.
 ...That's how I felt.
June, 1983

In Hinamizawa, a remote village near Shishibone city, there was a murder involving two female students.

The suspect is: Keiichi Maebara (Aged 1x)

The suspect called over his two female classmates

 (Rena Ryuugu, Mion Sonozaki) to his house, and beat them to death with a metal bat.

The scene of the crime was the suspect's room on the second floor of his house.

The inside of the room was covered with a significant quantity of splattered blood, and there were signs of a struggle with the victims.

In addition to the scene of the crime, the entryway, living room, and kitchen, all had traces of a struggle.

At the entryway, the shoe rack and wall had evidence of being impacted by a strong blunt force.

It is believed to have been the same bat as the murder weapon.

 Having no traces of blood, it is believed the destruction occurred before the murders.

There is the possibility that the suspect overpowered his victims to keep them from fleeing.

In the living room, the rug had been pulled back, then thrown aside.

It is hard to believe that this had a connection to the struggle with the victims, and thus the reason for this remains unknown.

In the kitchen, the garbage bag was torn apart, and its contents were spread out on the floor.

Garbage was strewn about in the surrounding area, and handprints believed to belong to the suspect were discovered.

It is believed that the suspect had for some reason taken out the garbage and struck it with his fists.

The reason for this remains unknown.

In addition, there was a note stuck to the fridge. The words "Was there a needle?" were written on it.

The meaning behind this remains unclear.

 Just in case, the garbage was searched, but a needle was not discovered.

Though the garage door was functional, it had been left open ever since the suspect moved in. The garage door was found closed.

The suspect's fingerprints were discovered on the garage door.

The reason behind this remains unknown.

The suspect fled the scene of the crime.

 However, a patrolling officer (Hinamizawa Local PD) found the suspect collapsed inside a phone booth.

At the time of discovery, the suspect was unconscious in critical condition.

He was rushed to the local hospital for treatment, but did not regain consciousness and died 24 hours later.

The results of the autopsy indicate the immediate cause of death to have been hypovolemic shock.

It was determined that the suspect had clawed at his own throat with his fingernails, and the resulting bleeding caused his death.

With the similarity to the death of Tomitake-san the prior week, the police believe there to be a connection and have opened an investigation.

(However, due to the wishes of the local authorities, it will be a confidential investigation.)

Due to the abnormal nature of the death, it was suspected that drugs were involved. But as with Tomitake-san, no traces were discovered.

What prompted all this remains inexplicable. As such, this case is being treated as an act committed on impulse.

However, with several accounts of the suspect's bizarre behavior leading up to the incident, it is possible that this was premeditated.

Separated from his group of friends. Isolation. Inexplicable behavior.

Several days before the incident, the suspect began carrying around a metal bat.

The suspect was observed displaying aggressive behavior, as well as talking to himself at school. His classmates have actually heard portions of what he was saying.

Two days before the incident, the suspect declared to his parents the possibility of his death.

Due to these circumstances, the police have begun an investigation on the possibility that this crime was not committed on impulse, but was instead planned several days in advance.

Afterwards...

 A note was found in the suspect's room that he had written himself.

The note was written on two sheets from a B5 college-ruled notebook that had each been torn in half.

And as if trying to conceal it

 was stuck hidden behind a clock on the wall.

The contents are as written in the appendix.

The police believe it to be strongly related to the incident.

The police changed their line of investigation based on the possibility that the suspect was involved in some sort of incident himself.

However, no further clues were found, casting doubt on the credibility of the note.

Was the crime impulsive or premeditated?

 With the situation unclear and no further developments, the case has been labeled as 'Unresolved.'

However... the following year,

 suspicion arose regarding the nature of the note.

The note was not written on two halves of B5 paper from two separate sheets...

but was originally a single sheet of B5 paper.

In order to erase several lines from the middle, someone had...

 torn them out.

Judging from the size of the letters, the missing section is estimated to be 2-3 lines.

It is highly probable that the person who eliminated the lines in question is not the suspect.

In addition, judging from traces of large quantities of cellophane tape being stuck to the back of the clock,

 speculation that something other than the note was stuck there, has arisen.

The person who first discovered the crime was a detective rumored to have a connection with the incident: Kuraudo Ooishi.

He underwent voluntary questioning, but denies involvement in any damages to the note.

The suspect's note:

I, Keiichi Maebara, am in fear for my life.

I do not know why they are after my life.

The only thing I do know is that it has to do with Oyashiro-sama's curse.

Rena and Mion are conspirators of the perpetrators.

 There are four or five adults, maybe more.

 They have a white van.

(This is all on the first sheet. The section below this has been ripped out.)

(This is from the second sheet. The section above this has been ripped out.)

I have no idea why it has become like this.

If you are reading this, then I am probably already dead.

 ...Though you may or may not find my body.

You, who are reading this. Please uncover the truth.

 That is my only desire.

Keiichi Maebara




[Onikakushi tip - 01]

<Keiichi>
"... So, Rena, we're the same age?"

<Rena>
"Yes.
 That's right.
 We're the same zodiac animal, too."
Hey, now, it would be weird if we were the same age but not the same zodiac animal.

<Mion>
"That's not true.
 If your birthday isn't the same then you can have different animals even if you're the same age!"

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 Oh, I see~
 Mion, you're pretty smart!"

<Rena>
"Ahahahahaha.
 What month were you born, by the way, Keiichi-kun?
 I'm July!"
Rena smirked and puffed up with pride.
... Hey, now, what's the meaning of this?
She's not planning to be all high and mighty if her birthday is a wee bit sooner than mine, is she...

<Keiichi>
"...Heh!
 Don't even.
 It's impossible to challenge me by birthday!!
 ... We can compete over who's the oldest if you like, with punishment, of course!"

<Rena>
"Huh?
 Huh!?
 Why?
 Why!?"

<Keiichi>
"...Heh!
 Don't even.
 It's impossible to challenge me by birthday!!
 ... We can compete over who's the oldest if you like, with punishment, of course!"
It's just... Sending her into a panic about something as simple as a birthday is so fun, I can't help myself.

<Mion>
"So that means you were born in April, Kei-chan?"

<Keiichi>
"Right on!
 Too bad, Rena!
 I'm already far older than Rena."

<Rena>
"Oh!
 I see!
 Then you're the same age as Mii-chan!"

<Mion>
"Well, it's just a few months~.
 That gap will open up again soon enough~!"
Mion snickered through her nose.
... Hey, now, that's not something to get all high and mighty about.
 As if I'm one to talk (heh).

<Keiichi>
"... Now that you mention it... You're in a higher grade, right, Mion?"

<Mion>
"If you're into underclassmen, then I can be an underclassman from now on!"

<Rena>
"Mii-chan, you're not making any sense to me..."
Just by seeing Rena's blushing face, you could tell she knew exactly what she meant by it, though...

<Keiichi>
"Then Satoko and Rika-chan are underclassmen.
 ... Their grade is so different that they should be in a different school, shouldn't they?"

<Rena>
"Ke... Keiichi-kun, your tastes are a bit too young, I think...
 I think..."
You're not making any sense yourself, Rena...
I'll just grab onto her head and scruff it up a bit.

<Rena>
"Hau~~~!! S~t~o~p~ i~t~~...!"

<Keiichi>
"I wondered about it before, yeah.
 I was wondering why this school has different school years all mixed up."

<Mion>
"There aren't enough classrooms.
 Can't help it.
 This building is being rented from the forestry services, after all~."
... When she says it like that, it makes sense.
 I've thought our school was strange for a while now.
The school yard is gravel, there are rooms that aren't for classes, and there's some strange sort of construction machinery parked here.

<Keiichi>
"Why is it being borrowed?
 What happened to the real school?"

<Mion>
"There was one here forever from before the war...
 It got dilapidated.
 They closed it down."
It probably was a grand old school house.

<Mion>
"Well, because of that, the students would have to attend the school in the city.  That's pretty far, though, you know?"

<Rena>
"Which school would that be?"

<Mion>
"Did you know there's a school if you pass by the Okinomiya train station, turn at the hospital, and head towards the pediatrics department?"

<Rena>
"W-Whaaaa!?!?
 S-So far...!"
I couldn't tell where that was by the location, but I understood it was pretty far from Rena's reaction.

<Mion>
"Well, that's why.
 The guys that didn't want to commute to Okinomiya rented out the building from the forestry services, and are attending this pseudo school house here."

<Rena>
"About half the children in Hinamizawa go here.
 There are quite a lot of kids that come here on bike."

<Mion>
"Well, since they're attending this really messed-up school, it might be pretty hard for them to get into higher education."

<Rena>
"That's not true, Mii-chan.
 If you study properly, you can go anywhere you want."

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, that's right, that's right!
 I totally agree with Rena on this one!"

<Rena>
"Yes, that's right.
 That's right!
 Let's try our best!"

<Mion>
"All of you, try your best.
 This old man will be rooting for you."

<Keiichi>
"Not just us! You, too!
 You should be preparing for exams, shouldn't you!?
 Your future is bleak with grades like this!"

<Mion>
"Fine, just fine.
 If I get stuck, then I'll just mooch off Kei-chan as he works forever."

<Rena>
"Wh-wh-what do you mean by mooch off Kei-chan!?
 What do you mean!?"

<Chie>
"Hey!
 You're too loud!
 Be quiet during self study!"
The teacher yelled at all three of us.
It was completely our fault...
Satoko saw it and chortled haughtily.
I stuck out my tongue at her in response.
... It is just as Mion says.
 This school has nothing to do with higher education.
But it makes up for that by having lots of valuable things other schools don't.



[Onikakushi tip - 02]
It's only June...
 but it's already so hot.
I could hear the higurashi outside chirping "miii miii," and at night, there are mosquitos.
 ...It might as well be summer already.
...My only salvation was that the mornings were still cool.

<Satoko>
"Summer, I do declare!"
Satoko was flapping her skirt languidly.
...That's pretty unladylike there.
...Even if she was a little brat, she still was a girl.

<Satoko>
"Keiichi does seem quite cool with just a single button-up shirt...
 I'm so jealous."

<Keiichi>
"From how I see things, the skirt you're wearing looks like it would be much cooler.
 A girl like you wouldn't understand just how hot it is wearing jeans in this season!"

<Rena>
"...It... it gets hot... Hau..."
This girl has gone imagining something indecent...

<Keiichi>
"Rena's summer clothes have a nice refreshing color.
 I feel cooler just looking at them."

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha.
 Thank you!
 They really do feel pretty cool."

<Satoko>
"I do wish my summer clothes were as breezy as Rena's."

<Rena>
"But Satoko-chan, your summer clothes are so cute, being a one piece and all!
 I'd like to wear your summer clothes.☆"

<Satoko>
"This is actually quite stuffy, you know.
 I do believe what you're wearing would feel much cooler."

<Rena>
"But it would be so much more fun with kyute clothes... Hao!"
...I had a feeling that Rena and Satoko's base values were fundamentally different.

<Keiichi>
"Speaking of which... our school doesn't have a uniform."

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 It doesn't.
 As long as they're proper, then regular clothes are fine."
There are quite a few students in regular clothes.
 There were a few wearing uniforms, but they were all the same design and rather plain.

<Keiichi>
"...What's the uniform they're all wearing?
 They're all the same."

<Satoko>
"That's the city school's uniform.
 It's not like there's a rule, but they're all wearing them."

<Keiichi>
"Speaking of which, everybody in our group is wearing a different uniform, aren't we?
 Did you go out of your way to get them from somewhere?"

<Satoko>
"Why, yes. Mion-san supplied them."

<Rena>
"Mii-chan's relative runs a secondhand clothing store. They can get school clothes from all over the country for cheap, they say."

<Keiichi>
"So you asked those relatives to get a bunch of unique school uniforms, then."
...That Mion, she probably loves using her friends as dress-up dolls.
...That must be a strange secondhand clothing store.
I get that it's a secondhand clothing store, but stocking clothes from schools all over the country?
...That's pretty strange for a secondhand clothing store.
What's the point in stocking up clothes from faraway schools they know nothing about??

<Rena>
"...Yeah. I think so, too.
 They also have used school swimsuits and P.E. uniforms...
 I don't like the idea of having used ones."

<Keiichi>
"Doesn't sound like that shop makes much money...
 They probably have Mion pitch in and help so they can make a bit more."

<Satoko>
"...But Mion-san says 'It'll be a big hit and become a great store!'
 with such conviction."
...A secondhand clothing store that stocks school uniforms will be a big hit?
... I don't get it.



[Onikakushi tip - 03]

<Mion>
"...So Kei-chan, you're not stinking rich?"

<Keiichi>
"What is this all of a sudden?
 Did I come to school in a limo before?"

<Mion>
"How much do you get for a monthly allowance?"

<Keiichi>
"About $10..."

<Satoko>
"My, that's a rather plebeian amount."

<Rika>
"...His lunch is made up of normal stuff.
 He isn't rich."
What are they talking about!?
To be asked out of nowhere how much I get and then told that's a plebeian amount!

<Rena>
"Ahahahaha. Sorry, sorry!"
Rena seemed to pick up on my dubious expression and started giggling.

<Mion>
"Kei-chan... your house, you know... It's pretty big, yeah?
 So the architecture has people all around Hinamizawa calling it the Maebara Manor, and it sorta stands out."
M-Maebara Manor~!?

<Rena>
"Since the house is so big, everybody is gossiping, wondering exactly how rich you are."
I see.
 Now I get it.
...Well, the frame of it is huge.
 I see how it could cause some misunderstandings.

<Satoko>
"From my deduction, I wager they spent too much money on building the house, and that is why they are now broke~!"

<Rika>
"...Being broke, how very, very unfortunate."
...Rika-chan took pity on me as she patted my head.
 I go from being treated like a millionaire to a beggar...

<Keiichi>
"Yeah, sorry for ruining your imagination, but we aren't millionaires or poor.
 We're the image of a normal, average household."

<Mion>
"You can't call it normal with that huge house!
 The entranceway is all grand, and the gate is large enough for a large truck to get through!!
 That's not normal at all!"
They do say the bigger your house, the more prosperous you are.
The reason the house is so big is because Dad's studio is in it, too.
There are a bunch of different workshops, and lots of his works are hung up in different places.
 All of them are huge, too.
For those reasons, the family actually uses only a third of the house for day-to-day living.
He planned it out so people and cars could come in to see the gallery he opens up in the house someday.
...By the way, the entranceway Mion is talking about is the one for the studio, and is normally sealed off.
 The entranceway the Maebara family actually uses is a very plain and simple one.
The interior is much different from how it looks on the outside.

<Mion>
"I'd really like a chance to explore Kei-chan's house...
 Claiming not to be rich, but having a home like that!!
 What could be hidden there!?"

<Rena>
"M-Maybe there's something kyute hidden! Hau~!"

<Satoko>
"They probably had no money to purchase furniture, so it's filled with spartan rooms!"

<Rika>
"...If there are carpeted rooms, I would love to try rolling around on the floor."

<Rena>
"Waa~! That'd be great, so great! I want to roll around, too~!"
...Seems like their imaginations were just piling on...
Well... Sometime in the near future, it wouldn't be too bad to invite them all to my house.
...Dad is a sucker for the ladies, so he might even let them look around his studio.
The cry of the higurashi crescendoed, as the sky towered over everything.
It was hot but the air was clear. It smelled like the beginning of summer.



[Onikakushi tip - 04]
From the June XXth 1979 edition.
The Shishibone city Okinomiya police station, June XXth, late at night.
Suspects XXXX, XXX, XXXX, XXXXX, XXXX were arrested on suspicion of murder and improper disposal of a corpse. The main offender, XXXX, has been added to wanted lists nationwide.
According to our sources, the six suspects were at the Hinamizawa dam construction site work room on the XXth at 9PM, 
where they are suspected to have assaulted and murdered the site overseer XXXX as a group, dismembering his body and hiding it.
On the XXth at 8 o'clock in the morning,
 a report was filed by the Shishibone city hospital in which a male suspect alluded to having murdered Mr. XXXX. 
When questioned at the police station, the individual confessed to the crime.
Since a portion of the body was recovered at the location he gave, he was arrested that afternoon on suspicion of murder and mutilation of a corpse.
The rest of the suspects were arrested the same day, but the main culprit is still at large.
 Police are currently on his trail.
The motive is purported to be
"a drunken verbal dispute, during which he killed the victim in a fit of anger."
However, as there are multiple inconsistencies with their testimonies, the investigation is ongoing.



[Onikakushi tip - 05]
October, 1975.
In accordance with the Prime Minister's bulletin number XXX, Hinamizawa's electrical development master plan was announced.
The vast scope of the projected Hinamizawa dam was to have an incredibly heavy impact on the village of Hinamizawa.
The area to be flooded by the Hinamizawa dam would include the five areas of Hinamizawa, Takatsudo, Kiyotsu, Matsumoto, and Yagochi.
The submerged area would include 291 houses.
 Population: 1,251,
 1 elementary school,
 1 middle school,
 1 post office,
 1 agricultural cooperative,
 1 forestry department lumber yard,
 5 shrines,
 2 temples, 
and 1 fishery.
 All of these communal, cultural, agricultural areas, and places of worship were to be indefinitely submerged at the bottom of the artificial lake basin.
Forsaking the hundreds of years our ancestors poured their blood and sweat into this fertile, resource-rich land was just too painful to bear.
All the residents having homes that were to be submerged banded together, and created the Onigafuchi Defense Alliance.
The dam project was halted and petitions to alter the plan were circulated.
The citizens sought peaceful negotiations, but the government and its puppet company XXXXX openly refused.
Performing unspeakable, heinous acts, they quashed the democratic actions of the villagers.
But the villagers did not falter. Instead, they banded together even more closely and steeled their resolve to protect their homes to the death.
The continuation of that frightening Hinamizawa dam construction project is still stalled as of today.
The villagers understand that the stalling was caused by sublime power through unity
 and they understand that this fearsome plan has not yet been fully withdrawn.
The Onigafuchi Defense Alliance had been dissolved after it did its part, but the feelings of unity it garnered have not yet been extinguished.
As long as that passion resides in the hearts of the residents, they'll be able to confront whomever next decides to sink their homes into a lake basin.
Onigafuchi Defense Alliance Committee Chairman,
 Kiichirou Kimiyoshi



[Onikakushi tip - 06]
Nightmare befalls the Hinamizawa dam!
Lynching and murder/dismemberment!
On X day of X month in XX prefecture at the Hinamizawa dam construction work site in Shishibone City, a bone-chillingly gruesome murder/dismemberment.
Even though this case has shocked the archipelago, the police will give no details on the case...
 Exactly what happened at the Hinamizawa dam...?
"They probably didn't mean to kill him at first,
 but as the victim resisted by swinging around a shovel, the rest of the perpetrators armed themselves in return, and it quickly escalated to homicide."
So said the aforementioned Investigator A.
After this bloody tragedy was over, they were left with a body which nobody could have mistaken as alive...
XX-san had tormented the suspects daily with his rough behavior.
At first it was meant to be payback...
"All the perpetrators were horrified by their deed
 and one even turned himself in to the police."
It was the de facto leader of this group, XX, who suggested hiding the body.
Reluctantly at first, they soon began to think they did not wish to be caught.
The construction site had numerous places to hide the body with six people...
They were originally supposed to hide the body and leave the area...
But the de facto leader feared that the consciences of the other five wouldn't be able to bear the burden
 and came up with a horrifying method to keep them from turning him in to the police...
He devised the heinous method of splitting up the body among them and making each of them responsible for hiding a piece.
"XX had turned a simple manslaughter into a gruesome dismemberment and forcibly involved each perpetrator in order to create a sense of unity between them."
Each one participated.
 But what does this mean?
 Person A spoke out reluctantly:
"XX had ordered each and every one of them to dissect a piece for themselves.
 They were hesitant at first, but nobody refused."
In for a penny, in for a pound... was what it meant.
Thus, an unimaginable bloody ceremony began.
"The perpetrators wept and vomited as they performed the gruesome task. 
There was one person who stubbornly refused, but XX threatened them, saying, "Nothing would change if someone else ended up dead," and he gave up in his objections.
But XX's plan collapsed in the span of one night.
XXX, who had refused to dissect the corpse up until the last moment, had broken down into tears at the hospital where he was being treated for an injury sustained during the scuffle and confessed...
The criminals were arrested one after the other, but the de facto leader XX's whereabouts are still unknown.
Also, the right arm hidden by XX has yet to be found.
Despite an ongoing search, this horrible individual has so far managed to elude law enforcement.
What could the police be doing...?
"It appears that XX had said he was going to throw the body (right arm) into the swamp.
 XX's car was discovered abandoned near the swamp, but there were no clues to his whereabouts."
XX didn't trust his companions.
One cannot deny the possibility that he had expected his companions to confess to the police and used his car as a decoy.
"Of course, I doubt that theory.
 Since he has no car, one would expect him to have a limited area to which he could have escaped to. 
But within the station there were rumors going around that he had accidentally slipped and drowned in the swamp when he went to throw away the body."
To the locals, that swamp is believed to be bottomless.
 It's known as Onigafuchi, the Demon's Abyss, and it's said that the bottom of the swamp is connected to the hellish world of demons.
The atrocious demon from hell that was XX.
 Could it be that he had returned to hell through the swamp...?

<Rika>
"...Rena's not here.
 Do you know where she is, Keiichi?"

<Keiichi>
"Huh?
 She was just there, actually...
 Hey, Mion.
 Where did Rena go?"

<Mion>
"Rena~?
 Didn't she go to the washroom?
 If you're planning to peep, I won't stop you. I'll call the cops, though~!"
I hadn't heard anything about that!

<Rika>
"...Satoko,
 do you know where Rena went?"

<Satoko>
"Rena-san, you say?
 I just passed her in the hallway.
 Rena-san has class duties today, so she's off to water the flower bed."

<Mion>
"Ah~ It was Rena's turn for class duty.
 Sounds like a drag."
...Rena, Rena, Rena.
...Upon hearing it repeated, a thought came to mind.
It's rude to say this about someone's name... but it was a weird name.
 It was like some foreigner's name.

<Keiichi>
"What kind of name is Rena, I wonder...
 What kind of kanji does her name use?"

<Rika>
"...Rena is her nickname.
 She has a proper name as well."

<Keiichi>
"What, really!?
 I was sure that Rena Ryuugu was her actual name."

<Satoko>
"Well...
 I can understand you making that mistake since we only call her Rena-san."
She even signs her name as "Rena."
 It's like it's her real name in school.

<Keiichi>
"I wonder what her real name is...
 Let's ask her when she comes back!"
Satoko and Rika-chan looked at each other.

<Rika>
"...You don't need to ask her.
 We'll tell you what it is."

<Satoko>
"It's the 'rei' from 'orei' and the 'na' from 'nara.'
 Her real name is Reina Ryuugu!"

<Keiichi>
"Reina, is it?
 ...Hmm.
 So it's read out as Rena instead of Reina?
 That's a pretty interesting reading."

<Rika>
"...No, that's not it. 'Reina' is the correct way."

<Satoko>
"Rena-san had told us that she wanted us to call her 'Rena.'
 So we call her Rena-san."

<Mion>
"Kei-chan...
 Rena is Rena, you know?
 Only strangers call her Reina.
 You get where this is going?"
I understood what Mion was saying.
It didn't matter what her real name was, only what names we used between us!
Rena Ryuugu is Rena.  She's nobody other than that.

<Keiichi>
"So I was thinking, if I had a nickname, would you call me by that?"

<Mion>
"If it's good.
 So what do you want to be called?"

<Keiichi>
"Con man."
Rena then came back into the classroom.
One of the juniors near the door told Rena people were looking for her.

<Rena>
"What's this now?
 Who is looking for me, I wonder?
 I wonder?"
Seeing that, both Mion and I sneered.

<Keiichi>
"Bailiff, Ryuugu doth show herself!!"

<Mion>
"Con man, you're quite sinister...
 Hwah hwah hwah!!!"

<Rena>
"Wh-What is this, what is this!?
 Keiichi-kun and Mii-chan are an evil bailiff and...?
 a con man!?"

<Keiichi>
"Damn you, Renanosuke Ryuugu!
 Today doth be when thou meetest thy maker.
 Have at thee~!!"

<Rena>
"Wah!
 Wah!
 Suke-san, Kaku-san, show them what-for!"

<Satoko>
"Aye aye, sir!!!"

<Rika>
"...I expect my fee to be paid to my Swiss bank account."
Since it's come to this, we have no choice! We'll just have a grand battle with five people...!

Rena's fierce punches exploded just as soon as she had shown her seal.
The evil that was Mion and myself was vanquished in the end...

<Keiichi>
"...I do hope that Rena does go on a journey to make the world a better place.
 How about heading to parliament first?"

<Mion>
"...Spare me.
I'll get kyute stuff for you on my travels."

The toll of the bell signaled that break time was over.

<Rena>
"Come on, come on Keiichi-kun, Mii-chan.
 The teacher's coming!"
I took Rena's hand and stood up.
It was just as the teacher had entered the classroom.
...Just one more hour.
 Man, oh man.
 ...Got to buckle down for one more!

From the June 1980 edition.
On the afternoon of XX at 2PM, office employee XXXX and his wife XXXX of Hinamizawa village in Shishibone prefecture
 disappeared after falling 27 meters from the observatory platform in Shirakawa prefecture.
Police and firefighters searched downstream and discovered the body of XXXX at around 7PM that evening.
His wife, XXXXX has yet to be found.
The search has run into difficulties due to the effects of Typhoon 3 from the previous day.
It appeared a railing at the observatory that the XXs leaned on had broken, causing them to fall.
The grounds keeping staff was questioned by the police in regards to facility deterioration, and if park maintenance was performed properly.



[Onikakushi tip - 10]
From the June 1981 edition
On the afternoon of XX around 10PM in the X district of Hinamizawa village in Shishibone prefecture, the shinto priest of the Furude shrine passed away after an existing condition he was recovering from suddenly worsened.
Parties close to the deceased said he was suffering from anxiety issues concerning the festival, which was to be held that day.
Also, after XXXX's death, his wife XXXX went missing, leaving behind a farewell note.
The police and local youth association continued the search. However, given the presence of the farewell message and the fact that the Onigafuchi swamp is said to be bottomless, they have run into difficulties.

<Okinomiya PS>
"This is Okinomiya Station, calling Unit 3.
 Unit 3 please respond."

<Ooishi>
"This is Unit 3,

<Okinomiya PS>
"Back-up is heading your way.
 Hold position until further instructions.
 Over."

<Ooishi>
"Roger, Unit 3 acknowledged."

<Okinomiya PS>
"Requesting no headlights.

<Ooishi>
"Station, the doctor has arrived.
 They want to carry it away. What's the order?
 Over."

<Okinomiya PS>
"Acknowledged.
 Leave it to the doctor."

<Ooishi>
"Affirmative.
 Understood.
 ...Ah, back-up has arrived.
 Shouldn't we let them take a photo first?
 ...I think the vic is done for."



[Onikakushi tip - 13]

<Forensic Investigator>
"Hypovolemic shock induced by clawing out their own throat.

<Forensic Investigator>
Tissue is packed under the nails.
 Not someone else's nails.
 It's undoubtedly by the individual's own nails.
 The shape of the scars also matches."

<Ooishi>
"Yeaaaah...
 I know the immediate cause of death was suicide."

<Forensic Investigator>
"I get it.
 You're saying the cause of death is unnatural, right?"

<Ooishi>
"It's not quite on the same level as when your back itches and you scratch a little too hard and draw blood, after all."
Some of Tomitake's fingernails had been pulled out.
Fingernails actually rip off surprisingly easily.
But it really hurts.
Under normal circumstances, the pain would prevent you from completely pulling them out.
Also, there were a lot of bruises on Tomitake's body.
...It's clear from the shape of them that he was assaulted first by someone—or a group of people.

<Forensic Investigator>
"According to the toxicology report, the deceased was in an extreme state of hysteria right before death."

<Ooishi>
"Then he fought back and clawed out his own throat because of how hysterical he had become?
 The guys attacking him certainly would have been surprised by that."
It is possible that, in such an abnormal environment, a person could perform acts that a sane individual couldn't possibly imagine.
Of course, those are very rare cases.

<Forensic Investigator>
"Actually, Ooishi-kun,
 that wood plank the deceased used as a weapon?
 They only found sand and the paint from the guardrail on it."

<Ooishi>
"What about cloth fibers or skin?"

<Forensic Investigator>
"Nothing.
 The deceased didn't strike the assailants...
 Or it could be they took the plank he was fighting back with."

<Ooishi>
"In that case, they wouldn't have gone out of their way to replace it with another.
 They'd take them all."

<Forensic Investigator>
"Har har har har!
 That's true."

<Ooishi>
"Tomitake's pretty built and tanned...
 He was quite athletic."

<Forensic Investigator>
"Hm?
 That's right.
 He was pretty active."
...I can't imagine what kind of sports he did when he was alive, but I think his physical strength would be on the higher side.
Meaning, he would be difficult to overpower in a brawl.
If a man with such a physique sensed he was in danger and swung the plank around frantically...
It's just unthinkable that it wouldn't even nick the perpetrator.
And his opponent was unarmed.
This guy had a wooden plank, so you'd think he'd hit them at least once...

<Ooishi>
"To surround and take down someone of his physique...
 I wonder how many people it would take."

<Forensic Investigator>
"Ya dimwit...
 If anything, that's your specialty.
 Have you forgotten your 'Bad Cop' days?"
If I was to take down this guy, how many would I need?
When a group wants to take down big prey it's fundamental to attack with numbers.
...I'd guess about four.
Even if there was a gap in their strength, they'd manage.

<Forensic Investigator>
"Then there were quite a few perpetrators.

<Forensic Investigator>
So any drunk-and-disorderly groups of more than four are suspicious?"
...A group of four or more.
Just... if they had that many, then couldn't they have hidden the body in a less obvious location?
Or... did he somehow break away from that fatal predicament...
Then there would be no reason to commit suicide.
Moreover, I still can't comprehend the irregular way he died...
 It's full of mysteries.

<Forensic Investigator>
"That's under serious consideration on my end, too.
 I'll be examining it as thoroughly as possible, but don't get your hopes up.
 After all, we've never encountered a death like this before."

<Ooishi>
"I'm not hoping for much.
 But I am looking forward to the results."

<Kumagai>
"Ooishi-san~!
 The chief is calling you!"

<Ooishi>
"Thanks. See ya 'round."

<Forensic Investigator>
"Yeah.
 Best wishes!"

<Ooishi>
"Let's cut to the chase... is there a drug that causes someone to kill themselves?"

<Forensic Investigator>
"Not directly, no."

<Ooishi>
"That's quite a roundabout response.
 You mean that there's one that does it indirectly?"

<Forensic Investigator>
"It's possible to induce a suicidal mental state,
 is what I mean."

<Ooishi>
"...That's hard to say.
 What would 'a suicidal mental state' be?"

<Forensic Investigator>
"Well, from the popular consensus in psychology,
 it's believed that people are most likely to attempt suicide when swinging from an introverted state to an extroverted one."
Clinical depression and bipolar disorder are different.
Clinical depression indicates a prolonged state of depression,
 whereas bipolar disorder is characterized by a passive depressed state accompanied by a very active manic state.

<Forensic Investigator>
"Well, from the popular consensus in psychology,
 it's believed that people are most likely to attempt suicide when swinging from an introverted state to an extroverted one."

<Ooishi>
"Basically, even without a drug, one can succumb to an irregular mental state."

<Forensic Investigator>
"The deceased was surrounded after being chased, and his life was in danger, right?

<Forensic Investigator>
All that stress could have messed with his brain chemistry, he could have hit his head, and those factors combined might have caused him to mutilate himself. It's a possibility."

<Ooishi>
"...Could you explain it to me in simpler terms...?"

<Forensic Investigator>
"Well, from the popular consensus in psychology,
 it's believed that people are most likely to attempt suicide when swinging from an introverted state to an extroverted one."

<Ooishi>
"Nahahahahahahah!!!
 Guess this means the assailants didn't have any intent to kill.
 They smacked him hoping to nick some change, and just happened to hit a bad place!"
The two plump men laughed hoarsely.

<Ooishi>
"...But of course, it's not like that."

<Forensic Investigator>
"Ahem.
 Undoubtedly..."

<Forensic Investigator>
"Whether it was habitual drug use, or something mental, the deceased's background holds the key.
 How's your investigation going?"

<Ooishi>
"Oh my goodness, look at the time!
 I need to get back soon or Kuma-chan will get angry with me."

<Forensic Investigator>
"Yeah!
 Good luck!
 Best wishes!"

<Ooishi>
"Best wishes!"



[Onikakushi tip - 17]

<Ooishi>
"...Herm?
 Those guys just now..."

<Kumagai>
"They had National Diet badges."

<Ooishi>
"Then it's prefectural assembly member Sonozaki and city councilor Sonozaki."

<Kumagai>
"That's interesting.
 The prefectural assembly member and city councilor are related."

<Ooishi>
"It's dirty is what it is.
 Shouting out each other's name during elections.
 While one is up for election, the other one holds an assembly, and they double up their campaign activities.
 Blatantly."

<Kumagai>
"I don't know much about this stuff, but isn't that against the rules of the election?"

<Ooishi>
"As long as they have no prior consultation, there are no restrictions on their political activities.
 Kuma-chan, the Second Investigation Division is going to be pretty tough for you. 

<Ooishi>
You should at least brush up on election laws."

<Kumagai>
"I'm not cut out to handle intellectual crime.
 'Cause I'm dumb. Heheheh...!"
There was prefectural assembly member Sonozaki and city councilor Sonozaki.
Also... the Mayor of Hinamizawa.
...So, they're all influenced by the Sonozaki family.
 What crap...

<Kumagai>
"Looks like they were seen off by... the deputy chief and the department chief."
It came to me.
That night, when the department chief invited me along to get some oden, I thought that was it.

<Takasugi>
"You have a lot of connections, so you might have heard something...
 have you?"

<Ooishi>
"Nope.
 Not a thing."

<Takasugi>
"Ma'am, I'll take a tofu fritter and fish cake.
 ...The councilors stormed in on the police chief in a rage."

<Ooishi>
"Oh, my. Is that so?
 Ma'am, I'll take another bowl."
Prefectural assembly member Sonozaki and city councilor Sonozaki were both intimidating.
Our snot-nosed career police chief couldn't handle being yelled at by them. They're like yakuza...

<Takasugi>
"A petition with your name came up regarding how the investigation of the Hinamizawa incident is being handled."

<Ooishi>
"Goodness, me?
 I've not the faintest."

<Takasugi>
"No need to play dumb.
 You're reopening the past cases regarding Hinamizawa,
 aren't you?"

<Ooishi>
"I've already got my hands full with Tomitake's death.
 Nahahaha!"

<Takasugi>
"Really?
 I hope so for your sake..."
There was a period of silence.
While we were silent, we made headway on our food and drink.

<Ooishi>
"Whew, that was quite the feast.
 This month has been a bunch of losses for me, so my wallet was feeling the pinch.
 Much appreciated."

<Takasugi>
"Nah, it's nothing.
 Tell me a good horse again.
 I'll bet on the same one as you."

<Ooishi>
"Nahahahah!
 I haven't been doing well there lately.
 I haven't been able to read the horses at all!
 ...Taxi!!!"
I'm going by train.
The department chief is taking a taxi.
I have my own car, but it'd be rash to drive it home.
 Can't blow it right before retirement with a DUI.
Even though he could still rattle off, it looked like his legs were already jelly.
Pushing him into the cab, I gave the driver the department chief's address.

<Ooishi>
"Well, see you again tomorrow.
 Best wishes...!"

<Takasugi>
"Ooishi-san."

<Ooishi>
"Yeah, yeah."

<Takasugi>
"The past incidents have all been closed.
 Stop lumping them all together.
 Those villagers half-believe it's really a curse."

<Ooishi>
"Well, I'm not convinced."

<Takasugi>
"You're going to be retiring next year, aren't you?

<Takasugi>
Weren't you going to pay off your mortgage with your severance pay and move up to Hokkaido with your mom?"

<Ooishi>
"Mother pines to return to her birthplace...
 It's the least I can do.
 And the severance? Well, I'll enjoy it at the entertainment district.
 Nahahahah!!"

<Takasugi>
"The chief said he may have to reconsider issuing your special retirement salary raise."
A public servant's severance payment is calculated based on their monthly salary when they retire.
So, a special promotion of two pay grades is given before retirement.
 This tops-up the employees severance payment. That tends to be how it's done around here.
Of course, it's not exactly a commendable custom...
Incidentally, the difference that two pay grades makes to the payout is quite significant.

<Ooishi>
"I'd expect no less of our egg-head chief, quite the model veiled threat.
 But... well...
 Considering how our pay comes from the public's hard-earned taxes,
 it's the way of the times, I suppose."
It certainly wasn't a laughing matter, but I'll laugh through it, anyway.

<Takasugi>
"I don't think it's such a model response.
 But given how hard you've worked, it's not at all odd for you to take home such a good package.
 Personally, I'd like you to get it."

<Ooishi>
"If I can get it, well, of course I'd want it.
 Nahahahah!"

<Takasugi>
"You'll get it.
 As long you're an adult about this."

<Ooishi>
"Sorry for holding you up here, Driver.
 Thank you very much."
I closed the door roughly, interrupting the department chief's conversation a bit rudely.
It looked like he still had something to say, but he just smiled wryly and waved. I waved in return.
The cab sped up gradually, and soon disappeared among the sea of lights.

<Ooishi>
"Nahahahah!
 ...Oh, man...
 I wonder if I'll be able to repay that loan..."



[Onikakushi tip - 18]

<Rena>
"Keiichi-kun's been feeling down lately.
 Maybe he's in a bad mood."

<Mion>
"I wonder.
 Maybe he's got a crush on someone?"

<Rena>
"M-M-Mii-chan, that's a logic leap...!"

<Mion>
"Uhyak hyak hyak hyak!!"

<Rena>
"...What do you think?"

<Mion>
"Don't know."

<Rena>
"..."

<Mion>
"Could be that Kei-chan...
 Maybe...?"

<Rena>
"...I don't know."

<Mion>
"That day, Kei-chan was in that car talking to some tubby middle-aged guy, right?"

<Rena>
"Yeah.
 No mistake."

<Mion>
"That Ooishi, he probably fed him something fishy..."

<Rena>
"He looked serious.
 Keiichi-kun's face was so pale."

<Mion>
"You see...
 You might not know this...
 But he's actually the messenger of Oyashiro-sama."

<Rena>
"Huh?
 What do you mean?"

<Mion>
"Whenever he shows up... someone is demoned away.
 No lie..."

<Rena>
"...Oh?
 Is that so?"

<Mion>
"...The year before last, when Rika-chan's mom drowned, right?
 Right before that, she was visited by Ooishi."

"...Now that you mention it, he was around before Satoshi-kun transferred out, too."

<Mion>
"Transferred~?
 Ahahahahahaha, you're so sweet, Rena."

<Rena>
"So this time he's appeared before Keiichi-kun...
 So Keiichi-kun is going to be demoned away too?"

<Mion>
"..."

<Rena>
"..."
An empty silence hung in the air.
 And then it was suddenly interrupted...
By loud laughter...

"I see it in movies quite often, but what is it, exactly?"

<Professor>
"Multiple personalities are thought to be escapism."

<Reporter>
"Multiple personality disorder is a form of escape?"

<Professor>
"Correct.
 The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to be a type of defense for the brain to retain mental stability."

<Reporter>
"Hypothetically, poor people imagining themselves as wealthy is a form of escapism, is it not?
 Is this also a form of multiple personality disorder?"

<Professor>
"I wouldn't go that far, but broadly speaking, one could infer that.
 It's something that occurs in us all."

<Reporter>
"Does a split personality occur when one cannot tell which is reality and which is the escape?"

<Professor>
"...That's difficult to say.
 There are some who agree with that, and some who disagree.
 There is no consensus."

<Reporter>
"Then is the occurrence of multiple personalities still an unknown phenomenon... something not fully comprehended in the psychiatric field?"

<Professor>
"Unfortunately, that is the current state of things.
 We can only put our hope in future research."

<Reporter>
"But, but~ It's sorta cool having a split personality~!
 What kind of people get split personalities?"

<Professor>
"Recent studies find that those who develop it... or rather, those who are more susceptible to developing it,
 may be genetically predisposed or may have had abnormal mental development... 

<Professor>
Some say that childhood abuse increases the chances."

<Reporter>
"Speaking of which, Person A here experienced abuse as a child, didn't he~ How sad~..."

<Reporter>
"Person A has seven different personalities.
 Let's watch a video of him...
 Right after these commercials!!"



[Onikakushi tip - 20]
The Seventh Mart was a bargain supermarket with food and alcohol.
I flopped the colorful collection of cup noodle bowls into the cart, muttering in irritation at being rushed by my parents.
 As expected, Mom gave a disbelieving look and asked why I had to get so many flavors.

<Keiichi>
"Cup noodles have gotten so elaborate recently, and there are a bunch of different types.
 I want to try each of them at least once."
I knew it was pretty selfish of me, but I thought I'd at least give it a try.
I flopped the colorful collection of cup noodle bowls into the cart, muttering in irritation at being rushed by my parents.
 As expected, Mom gave a disbelieving look and asked why I had to get so many flavors.
Well, I had a feeling it'd end up like this.
Now that Dad had thrown his hat into the ring, I'd have to compromise.

<Keiichi>
"Then I'd only get to eat one kind!
 I'd get bored with it!"
I was resisting as a formality.
I had already given up inside and wasn't sure which case of noodles to get.
I flopped the colorful collection of cup noodle bowls into the cart, muttering in irritation at being rushed by my parents.
 As expected, Mom gave a disbelieving look and asked why I had to get so many flavors.
If I let Mom pick, she'd err on the side of safety and get soy sauce or salt flavored.
So, when I plonked a large box of pork-bone flavor in the shopping cart, Mom looked back at me with an expression as if to say "...These ones?"
 To show her this was my last compromise, I began explaining the choice.

<Keiichi>
"Pork-bone is good!
 You get a large serving, but the flavor isn't too strong...!!"
I remembered insisting that the noodles I picked were the right kind.
In this frozen memory in time, this encapsulated world, I didn't have the power to look around my surroundings.
So... I did what I could and reached out with my hearing and vision, sharpening my senses to find the presence I overlooked.
No matter how much I search through my field of vision... I couldn't see Rena.
I rewound the situation, searching.
But of course, I couldn't find her.
Then... was she spying at me from my blind spot...?
I go through the sound and presences again, looking.
I could sense the other customers.
They were all mixed about... moving as they please.
There was nobody looking over this way and no one trying to get behind me.
Not here.
 Couldn't be here.
 Probably wasn't here.
I would definitely notice if someone was right behind me... even when I wasn't on my guard.
I smiled wryly at the thought of using a vague word like "probably" right before contradicting it with "definitely."
Then, I paused my mental replay as a chill ran down my spine.
...There was definitely a presence like a shadow behind me.
That was... a terror unlike any other.
If a presence really had manifested behind me, I would definitely have turned around to check for it.
But the world had moved on, and there was no way for me to turn around...
While carrying that frightening shadow on my back, I was gleefully running around the store searching for a case of noodles...?
Running through the instant noodle section, bad-mouthing my mom...
But... There was that presence constantly at my back. Sticking to me like a shadow.
No way to see what it was. Realizing it now after the fact was horrifying and repulsive...
In that moment of time, I was running around gleefully...
Carrying that cardboard box.
Tip-tap.
...But listening to that moment again... I could hear footsteps other than mine going pit-pat with every step.
Tip-tap tip-tap tip-tap.
 Pit-pat pit-pat pit-pat.
Tip-tap tip-tap.
 Pit-pat pit-pat.
Tip-tap tip-tap.
 Pit-pat pit-pat.
While I was running, the sound of those barefoot footsteps going pit-pat were right behind mine.
Me running around gleefully... In that closed-off moment in time.
But I... didn't hear it.
No. I heard it. That's why I remembered it.
...I didn't think I had heard anything.
That's why I didn't turn around.
That is why... I didn't turn around...!!!
In that moment, the pit-pat of those footsteps were following me the entire time.
I couldn't run faster and escape.
I couldn't run any faster than I had ran at that time.
I couldn't turn around.
I hadn't turned around before. Not once.
Then I returned to my parents and started talking.
 The shadow-like presence was right at my back.
Since I didn't move, the shadow didn't move.
 That is why it made no sound.
 That was all.
At that time, I hadn't taken a single step while talking with my parents.
I was just standing there.
 This was undeniable.
And yet...
 I heard it...
 A pit-pat...
That shouldn't be.
If I took three steps, it followed three steps.
 Wasn't that the rule...?
There was no sound other than that.
At that time, the entire world had gone dark...
 A sudden darkness.
It was the end of my reflective journey.
I was tired.
I wanted to end it.
Someone turn on the light.
Except my body couldn't move.
...As if I was sewn into... that moment in time.
Pit-pat
My past self's hair stood on end.
That's impossible...!?
Now that's just breaking the rules!
I haven't moved!
So you shouldn't be moving, either!!
I couldn't move!
 So you shouldn't be able to move either!!
 Follow the rules!!!
Pit-pat
Yet that sound echoed in the darkness once again.
The hair on the back of my neck pricked up on end.
It was so close... that it was hard to tell whether it was touching the hair or not.
Why couldn't I move... like how the presence was moving behind me!?!?
...I quickly realized.
I could move.
...It's just that I was scared and didn't want to.
But now was the only time I could turn around.
It was something unforgivable in this moment in time...
 But... I needed to turn around immediately...!!
As if my entire being was trying to force me to stop, it began to administer a pain like a needle being stuck into my every pore...
I'll turn around!
I'll turn around!
I'm not scared at all!
I'll turn around!
I'll turn around!
I'm not scared at all!!
A scream I was unable to vocalize.
RoOoOoOOOOOOoOoOOh!!!!!
I turned around!
...At first... I couldn't understand the meaning of it.

<Keiichi>
"...Wha... what?"
What... is this?
Just as a person's mouth might bite into an apple, slurp the juices, and finally discover that it was an apple... my mind began to process the scene before my eyes by 'eating the apple.'
Munch munch, chew chew...
Slurp the juices... and discover the apple.
Meaning... what was in front of me was...
GwAAAAaAaAaAAAAAaAaAAaAAaAAAAaAah...
